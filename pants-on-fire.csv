He claimed to have explosives and demanded to speak with President Joe Biden. Facebook later removed the video and took down accounts associated with Roseberry from Facebook and Instagram, a spokesperson said.Congressional staffers and Washington residents who were at or near the Capitol as the threat unfolded also spoke to the Post. None indicated that the event, which prompted evacuations, was or seemed to them like a false flag.Mark Fenster, professor of law at the University of Florida and the author of a book about conspiracy theories, said false flag claims are ""an especially powerful version of how conspiracy theories try to instruct people that what they see, are told, and believe are wrong."" ""A false flag claim turns what seems on its face to be an event that is easily explicable — the Capitol riot was conducted by far-right supporters of President Trump — into its opposite,"" Fenster said.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Milwaukee election official didn’t admit to delivering just enough ballots for a Biden win","Though the 2020 presidential election happened nearly 10 months ago, challenges to its results have not stopped. Yet Trump is still falsely claiming that the election was stolen from him. In an Aug. 12, 2021 email statement praising Brandtjen’s efforts, Trump wrote that Wisconsin ""shows many (to put it mildly) signs of cheating in the 2020 election, and people want answers, now."" Later in the statement, he added: ""A Milwaukee election official even acknowledged dropping off just the margin of ballots needed for a Biden win at 3:00 AM."" That incident has provided fuel for many claiming the election was stolen, but that’s not what happened. Let’s take a look back. ""Damn, Claire, you have a flair for drama, delivering just the margin needed at 3:00 a.m."" the consultant wrote.

""I just wanted to say I had been awake for a full 24 hours!"" The email exchange was published first by two right-wing websites that have focused on how the election was conducted. They have prompted numerous threats against Woodall-Vogg.She later told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel she read the email as a joking way to note the state’s results couldn’t be called until Milwaukee’s total came in. She called the email ""a very inappropriate joke"" but not evidence of an attempt to steer the election to Biden. What’s more, it was expected that Milwaukee’s final tally of votes would come in the middle of the night because Wisconsin election officials aren’t allowed to start counting absentee ballots until Election Day, and there were many more of those ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic. Both Republican and Democratic observers were at Milwaukee’s absentee ballot-counting center until all results were tallied. Finally, in answering the email, Woodall-Vogg did not acknowledge what Trump claimed she has. No election officials have said they threw the election.Trump claimed that a Milwaukee election official had acknowledged dropping off just the margin of ballots needed for a Biden win at 3 a.m. Though Woodall-Vogg said she read the email she received from the election consultant as a joke, contrary to the Trump claim, she did not acknowledge doing what was claimed, nor has any election official acknowledged that they threw the election. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Charlie Kirk baselessly claims Biden intentionally let Afghanistan fall to alter U.S. population,"Hours before President Joe Biden addressed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in a speech to the nation, one conservative commentator falsely accused Biden of intentionally letting the country fall as part of a ""sinister"" plot to boost Democrats’ political prospects.Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, continued: ""President Joe Biden's Department of Defense will accept 30,000 Afghan refugees into military installations following the collapse of Kabul. Boom, political transformation. Let the country crumble. Do you know there's 5 million displaced people in Afghanistan now? This was all intentional. Joe Biden let it fall apart to now say, ‘Oh, I'm so sorry.’ … ""Do you see what's going on here? What's going on here is Joe Biden wants a couple hundred thousand more Ilhan Omars to come into America to change the body politic permanently.""There were several factual and logical problems with Kirk’s claims.""I have seen no evidence that President Biden let Kabul fall or took the actions he did related to Afghanistan so that the U.S. could bring in more refugees and change the population in a way that favors Democrats,"" said Christopher Preble, a foreign policy expert at the Atlantic Council.Taliban fighters patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 19, 2021.

With little resistance from the Afghan forces funded with billions of U.S. dollars, the Taliban took back control in just a few weeks.But there’s no evidence that the fall of Kabul, the Afghan capital, was the ""intentional"" outcome of a Biden scheme to change the U.S. population in favor of Democrats, as Kirk claimed. ""He did not have to let the government fall to generate Afghan refugees,"" said Barnett Rubin, a senior fellow at the Center for International Cooperation at New York University.President Joe Biden speaks about Afghanistan from the White House on Aug. 16, 2021, in Washington.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, taxpayer funds were not used to remove rock deemed by some to be racist from UW-Madison campus","Chamberlin Rock has a storied history on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The rock has been on the campus for decades, but recently became a source of strife over an old nickname. According to the State Journal, in a 1925 story the rock was referred to with a phrase including the N-word. At that time, the Ku Klux Klan was active on the Madison campus. The recent rediscovery of the nearly 100-year-old news article caused a re-evaluation of the boulder, which became a reminder to some of Wisconsin’s troubling past. Because of that reference, the decision was made to move the boulder off campus, to a location near Lake Kegonsa, where it can still be used for educational purposes by the geoscience department, the State Journal said. ""It cost the university $50k (your tax dollars) to remove this ‘racist’ rock,"" she wrote. ""These are the priorities of the woke UW Madison Taliban.""In the tweet, she linked to the State Journal story. For this fact-check, we’ll be focusing on her claim that Wisconsin taxpayers were on the hook for the rock removal. There is not even a pebble of truth to that.The State Journal report itself, the very story Campos-Duffy linked to and the touchstone for her claim says the cost of the removal would be funded by private donations.That is, not tax dollars. And not tuition money. Just to be sure, we reached out to Gary Brown, the university’s director of campus planning and landscape architecture. ""The cost for relocation of the glacial erratic was less than $50,000 (I don’t have all the bills in yet, but it will indeed be less than $50,000),"" Brown wrote in an email on Aug. 13, 2020. ""The funding is coming from the chancellor’s office using non-taxpayer dollars.""Brown went on to say that this was always the case for the rock removal, and the source of money has consistently been listed as donations. The donor, or donors, have not been named. We tried to reach Campos-Duffy, but did not hear back.Campos-Duffy claimed ""It cost the university $50k (your tax dollars) to remove"" a rock considered by some a symbol of racism.But the university did not use taxpayer money.

PANTS-FIRE,Texas GOP perpetuates debunked voter fraud claim in fundraising mailer,"The Texas GOP sent a mailer earlier this week that focuses on an election fraud claim out of Arizona in an attempt to attract donations for upcoming congressional races. The claim stems from a recent audit of the November election in Maricopa County, which includes Arizona's largest city Phoenix, ordered by Arizona’s GOP-controlled Senate. The Senate held a hearing on the ongoing audit July 15 in which they announced preliminary results showing that 74,243 mail-In ballots were counted with ""no clear record of them being sent.""The number caught the attention of the Texas GOP. On July 20, the party’s chairman Matt Rinaldi latched onto it in an emailed donation plea.  ""Seventy four thousand... That’s how many mail-in ballots were recently found in Arizona that have NO clear record of being sent in,"" reads the first line of the mailer, sent Tuesday. ""That’s exactly why we are fighting so hard for election integrity in Texas."" ""For months, the left called us conspiracy theorists, crazies, and even un-American for daring to raise legitimate concerns about the 2020 presidential election,"" it said. The preliminary audit results also caught the attention of former President Donald Trump, who issued a statement repeating the same finding: ""it seems that 74,243 Mail-In Ballots were counted with ‘no clear record of them being sent.’"" In a statement sent to PolitiFact Texas, the Texas GOP spokesperson blamed Democrats for ""attempting to overturn election code nationwide."" ""If the press and Democrats don't like the fact that 74,000 ballots have either major clerical errors or potential fraudulent backgrounds, they should be asking the Arizona Audit Chief for more information,"" spokesperson Luke Twombly said. ""The Texas GOP has always been committed to election integrity and full transparency. It has only been Democrats who have attempted to overturn election code nationwide and muddy the waters of an election that raised red flags across multiple states."" The Arizona audit chief is Doug Logan, the chief executive officer of Cyber Ninjas, a cybersecurity firm hired by Arizona Senate Republicans. Cyber Ninjas had no prior experience in election auditing before it was hired, and Logan was an advocate of ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories. ""We have 74,243 mail-in ballots where there is no clear record of their being sent. ... That could be something where documentation wasn't done right — there was a clerical issue, there's not proper things there — but I think when we've got 74,000, it merits, you know, knocking on a door and validating some of this information,"" he said, referring his suggestion to visit voters door to door as part of the audit.During the hearing, Logan said he based the 74,000 number on two types of early voting reports issued by Maricopa County. But his understanding of what the two files represent was contradicted by Maricopa County officials. Logan said that the EV32 file records when mail-in ballots are sent, and the EV33 file records when mail-in ballots are received by the county. The discrepancy between the two files accounts for Logan’s 74,243 figure.  Furthermore, the county records both mail-in ballots and early in-person ballots as early votes, and both are included in the EV32 and EV33 totals. Lastly, the two files capture votes submitted during different time periods. While the EV32 file includes all requests that voters made for early ballots up to 11 days before Election Day, the EV33 file includes returned early ballots up to the Monday before Election Day, according to the AP.  An audit performed by the election officials earlier this month found 182 clear cases of voter fraud out of more than 3 million ballots cast in last year's presidential election, according to the Associated Press. Each of the 182 cases were referred to investigators and so far four cases have led to charges.President Joe Biden won the state by about 10,000 votes during the general election.In a political fundraising mailer, the Texas GOP perpetuated a voting fraud claim based on a partisan Arizona election audit, saying that 74,000 mail-in ballots were recently found in Arizona without a record of ever being sent.  The claim, which has been repeated by Trump and others, has been roundly debunked, both by past and present Maricopa County election officials.

It does not explain her method of calculation or how she arrived at that conclusion. And even though the agency has received more than 6,000 reports of death to its database, ""a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" according to the CDC. An Instagram post claimed, ""45,000 confirmed dead from the COVID-19 shots within three days… and they’ve covered it up."" The number tracks back to a woman who did not reveal her method for calculating the figure and who has not been publicly identified. She based her calculations on reports of deaths in VAERS, according to a lawsuit. But the number does not align with data contained in VAERS — and even the reports of death entered into that system do not prove that those people died as a result of receiving a vaccine. VAERS is an open system that contains reports that can be submitted by anyone and are not verified. Finally, the claim was part of a lawsuit by America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that has peddled many false and conspiratorial claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Déjà vu all over again as former President Trump wrongly claims Wisconsin victory,"As the Wisconsin Republican Party gathered for its annual convention to plot strategy for the future, former President Donald Trump continued his effort to re-fight the last election.""We had actually great results in Wisconsin, as you know in 2016 we won and as you also know in 2020 we won,"" the former president said. If Trump wants re-litigate the claim that he won in 2020, we can revisit it, too. Hint: His claim is still ridiculously false.Some excerpts from that item:""On Nov. 4, 2020, the morning after Election Day, the Associated Press declared Biden the winner in Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported unofficial results showed Biden with a lead of about 20,000 votes -- and that the Trump campaign was already vowing to request a recount.""When it did request the recount, Trump’s team focused only on heavily Democratic Dane and Milwaukee counties. But, by the time the recount was over, Trump actually fell further behind.""Also: ""Having failed, the Trump campaign turned to the court system.""But on Dec. 3, 2020, in a 4-3 decision, the state Supreme Court rejected the campaign’s request to overturn the certification of votes. Instead, the court said Trump’s campaign had to start at the circuit court level. It was a major setback, with even dissenting judges indicating they may reject the call to throw out hundreds of thousands of ballots.""A day later, the court said it would not accept a lawsuit by Trump allies who wanted to let Republican lawmakers decide how to cast the state's electoral votes, rather than the electors chosen by voters in the election. ""Meanwhile, the campaign also went to the federal court, where U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig questioned whether the case should even be before him, calling part of the lawsuit’s requested remedy ‘really bizarre’ and told an attorney for the Trump campaign it was seeking  ‘pretty remarkable declaratory relief.’ Ludwig has scheduled a hearing for Dec. 10.""In the end, that effort failed as well -- as did numerous other court challenges to the results. Beyond that, there has been no evidence presented that suggests widespread fraud -- enough to overturn the election -- took place. Trump’s claim that he won Wisconsin in 2020 was ridiculous when he first made it.If anything, to keep repeating it is more ridiculous now.Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Trump misses mark on claim that Wisconsin Republicans refuse to investigate 2020 election,"President Joe Biden won Wisconsin nearly eight months ago, but the 2020 election in the state -- or at least the questioning of it -- seems to be never ending. Shortly after Biden won the state by more than 20,000 votes, thanks largely to Dane and Milwaukee counties, which both had large numbers of absentee ballots, President Donald Trump’ campaign pursued a recount in those two counties. But that effort only shifted the margin by 87 votes toward Biden. Additionally seven lawsuits challenging aspects of the election have all failed, including at the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court and no evidence of widespread fraud has surfaced.  The June 25, 2021 statement from Trump’s Save America PAC went on to say: ""They are actively trying to prevent a Forensic Audit of the election results, especially those which took place in Milwaukee, one of the most corrupt election locales in the country. Don’t fall for their lies! These REPUBLICAN ‘leaders’ need to step up and support the people who elected them by providing them a full forensic investigation."" So is Trump right?Are Vos, Kapenga and LeMahieu trying to prevent further audits and examinations, and to ""cover up election corruption""? In a word: No.Quite the opposite, actually.Republicans have called for several investigations into election results.Despite the failed recount, the many lawsuits, agreement that the Wisconsin election was free and fair and no evidence of enough fraud to overturn the result, Republicans are -- contrary to Trump’s claim -- continuing to investigate.As a part of the effort, Vos said the former officers will review all tips received about election fraud and look into the credible ones, and will be paid with taxpayer funds. The team will also spend time looking into claims of double voting, as well as review how some clerks, following State Election Commission guidance, filled out some missing elements of absentee ballot applications. Requested by Republican lawmakers, the audit will look at issues that have faced scrutiny from courts and election observers, such as how the state maintains its voter rolls and when it allows voters to get absentee ballots without showing an ID. ""When I saw the president’s statement, it surprised me because many on the left have been going after us harder than I have ever seen, because in Wisconsin, we have hired investigators, we have passed legislation and we are doing a forensic audit already,"" Vos said. ""So I think this is one of those cases where the president was just misinformed by his staff or he didn’t see the media reports.""At the convention, Vos also announced that former conservative Supreme Court Justice Mike Gableman would oversee the former officers during their investigation. Gabelman will be paid at taxpayer expense. But what of Trump’s assertion that Wisconsin legislators are refusing a ""forensic"" audit? It wouldn’t be off base to think the GOP-backed effort in Wisconsin -- involving retired police officers and a former Supreme Court justice -- would take such an approach. That said, the investigation method here may look different from what is happening as a part of Arizona’s ""forensic"" audit, where ballots and machines are being looked at. Trump claimed that Wisconsin Republican leaders ""are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin.""That’s wrong.If anything, Republican leaders have taken great criticism for the continued efforts to dig into the results of an election that has already seen a recount and numerous legal challenges. Republicans have gone so far as to say they will use taxpayer money to pay a former state Supreme Court justice to oversee an effort led by retired police officers, also to be paid by taxpayers.Critics may say that effort is a ridiculous exercise. But our focus here is on Trump, and his claim Republican leaders have failed him and are doing nothing to examine the election results.That’s plainly ridiculous. Pants on Fire."

The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by cutting $800 million in spending and drawing $700 million from the state’s rainy day fund.Turns out McAuliffe did overestimate the shortfall and, after all the spending cuts, the state ended the fiscal year with a $550 million surplus.Another falsehoodOur rulingMcAuliffe tweeted, ""I inherited the largest budget deficit in the history of the state from the Republicans."" In fact, he inherited two balanced budgets from his predecessor and then, in the first months of his governorship, saw state revenues shrink because of federal policies.

I am assured that he still is president.""It’s a new take on a previously discredited claim. There’s no evidence Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. And he is not still president. President Joe Biden’s inauguration occurred Jan. 20, and Trump stopped being president at noon that day.The Insurrection Act, signed by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, empowers the president, in limited circumstances, to deploy the military and federalize National Guard troops to suppress certain situations including civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion.The act has been used to send the armed forces to quell civil disturbances a number of times during U.S. history. It was most recently invoked during the 1992 Los Angeles riots after four white police officers were acquitted in the roadside beating of a Black man, Rodney King.But there’s nothing in the law that would allow a president to extend his term.""Every prior president to invoke the Insurrection Act has complied with this requirement,"" Anderson said. ""Trump never issued such a proclamation so, regardless of what he did or did not sign on January 14th, he did not take the steps necessary to invoke the Insurrection Act.""Syracuse University law professor Mark Nevitt, whose specialties include constitutional and national security law, said there is no evidence that the National Guard has been federalized, or the military has been activated under Insurrection Act authorities. ""President Biden is currently the commander in chief and Lloyd Austin is the secretary of defense; they have legal authority over the military,"" he said.We rate the post Pants on Fire."

""No sir. Republicans are just following the science. And since removing the mask mandate two months ago, Texas has not reported a single COVID death.

PANTS-FIRE,Ted Cruz repeats false claim that voting bill 'would register millions of illegal aliens to vote',"Attacks on Senate Democrats’ latest attempt to rewrite the nation’s voting laws have grown fierce, and perhaps no other Republican has condemned the Democratic measure quite like U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.  To Cruz, the For the People Act, or S 1, is ""the most radical legislation the Senate has considered"" since Cruz entered office in 2013, and it’s ""the most dangerous legislation pending before the U.S. Congress,"" he said during a Tuesday morning meeting of the Senate Rules Committee. Then, invoking a term many Democrats have used to denounce the slew of voter restriction bills being pushed by GOP-led state legislatures across the nation, Cruz called the For the People Act ""Jim Crow 2.0."" ""This legislation would register millions of illegal aliens to vote. It is intended to do that,"" Cruz said. And by allowing ""millions of people to vote illegally,"" his argument continues, it would ""dilute the legal votes of American citizens."" ""This bill doesn’t protect voting rights, it steals voting rights from the American people,"" he said. Cruz was not the first person to say this piece of legislation would expand voting access to immigrants who are in the country illegally. In March, as the House deliberated HR 1, former Vice President Mike Pence wrote in an opinion article that the bill would ensure that ""millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote."" Similar rhetoric then spread through viral social media posts, which claim that the bill gives immigrants in the country illegally the ""right to vote.""But Cruz continued that line of argument Tuesday. According to his spokesperson, Cruz argues that the bill’s automatic voter registration provision ""will register ineligible voters, including illegal aliens and noncitizens."" The automatic voter registration provision would expand a practice that is already in place in 19 states (not including Texas) and Washington, D.C. The policy would require state agencies to share information collected on individuals with election officials to help streamline voter registration processes. A person interacting with one government office — like the department of motor vehicles or a public assistance agency — would have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes. This would automatically register eligible citizens to vote or update their voter registration information unless they opt out.The For the People Act states that the purpose of the automatic registration provision is to enable governments ""to register all eligible citizens to vote."" It also states that state agencies can share voter-registration information of eligible citizens only.  But Cruz’s spokesperson, Steve Guest, said that although the bill ""purports only to allow registration for citizens, the bill nowhere requires proof of citizenship as part of automatic registration."" But the absence of that requirement doesn't mean ""millions of illegal aliens"" will begin registering, experts say. If a state agency doesn’t know a person’s citizenship status when referring their information to election officials, it would direct them to a registration form where they would attest to their citizenship, as required by the National Voter Registration Act. Any voter who falsely attests to citizenship on the registration form would face penalties for perjury which, in Texas, is a class A misdemeanor punishable by fines and up to one year in jail. Local election agencies also still would be required to determine an applicant’s voting eligibility in the same way they already do, which experts say is effective in filtering out noncitizens. ""We know that the deterrent effect (of perjury penalties) and enforcement of those laws has been highly effective,"" Becker said. ""We do not see any significant number of noncitizens on the lists."" So how does Cruz figure that the bill would lead to ""millions of illegal aliens"" registering to vote? His office points to ""historical evidence of automatic voter registration registering illegal aliens.""""Those are system glitches, technical problems that absolutely should be fixed. Proving citizenship would not fix them. They were problems in how the systems were designed and they were fixed,"" he said. When asked how Democrats have demonstrated that the intent of the For the People Act is to ""register millions of illegal aliens to vote,"" Cruz's spokesperson referred to two of the 46 amendments Cruz has introduced. One would require people to prove their citizenship for automatic voter registration. The second would allow for the prosecution of people who are automatically registered but were ineligible.Cruz’s office argues that Democrats’ lack of support for these amendments proves that their intent behind the bill is to allow noncitizens to vote.""If Democrats don’t actually intend to register illegal aliens and the bill wouldn’t actually register illegal aliens and noncitizens, then they would have supported Sen. Cruz’s amendments,"" Guest said. ""There are millions of illegal immigrants in America. The intended effect of automatic voter registration is to register millions of illegal aliens to vote and Democrats blocked explicit provisions to verify citizenship and remove legal protections for the inevitably registered illegal aliens."" According to Becker, the lack of support for Cruz’s proof-of-citizenship amendment is due to the unconstitutionality ruling from Kansas.  ""It would not be unusual for anyone who understands the law to suggest that they not include something in the bill that could violate the U.S. Constitution,"" he said. And the lack of support for Cruz’s amendment that would allow prosecution is due to the fact that automatic voter registration systems do occasionally err — as evidenced by cases in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada. And it’s unreasonable to prosecute people whose voter registrations were caught up in system glitches through no fault of their own, Becker said.  During a Senate committee meeting over a Democratic voting rights bill, Cruz said that the bill will ""register millions of illegal aliens to vote."" He also said that this is the Democrats’ intent behind this bill because Democrats believe these people ""are likely to vote for Democrats."" His claim is based on a requirement in the bill that directs states to adopt automatic voter registration systems, which 19 states and Washington D.C. already have. But a section of the law instructs state agencies to share information for voter registration purposes only for citizens. People are also required to attest to their citizenship under penalties of perjury.The bill also does not change the fact that local election agencies would still be required to vet an applicant’s voting eligibility, as they have done in the past.  Although glitches and malfunctions of automatic registration systems have been recorded, they are rare and easily corrected.We rate this claim Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,The ridiculous claim that those at the Capitol Jan. 6 resembled a 'normal tourist visit',"Some Republicans downplayed the violent acts that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, with one lawmaker comparing the breach to a ""normal tourist visit.""""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall, showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes taking videos and pictures. If you didn't know the TV footage was a video from Jan. 6, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit,"" Clyde said at a May 12 House hearing. Clyde’s comparison of the breach of the Capitol to a ""normal tourist visit"" is a ridiculous assertion. Here’s what rioters did on Jan. 6. They forced their way through barricades and past law enforcement to breach the building. They smashed windows and broke doors. They ransacked offices. They chanted ""Hang Mike Pence!"" They attacked police officers. They caused the House and Senate to shut down for several hours on the day they were certifying the presidential election. One put his feet up on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office and left her a nasty note. None of these actions are things that tourists normally do at the Capitol.The fact that people weren't seen committing violence on camera during that particular moment doesn’t make it a tourist visit.A description in one of the charging documents states that at about 2 p.m., people forced their way through, up and over barricades and police officers to advance to the exterior facade of the building. They forced their way into the building by breaking windows and assaulting law enforcement.""Normal Capitol visits don’t include individuals armed with zip ties, bear spray, and blunt objects,"" or violent clashes with police, said Michael Jensen, principal investigator at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. ""Typical Capitol tourists don’t smash windows, loot offices, or deface Capitol property. Those types of things happen during insurrections, which is what Jan. 6 was.""Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said the criminals who rioted were at the Capitol for purposes far from tourism.""A tourist is someone who travels for pleasure seeking, cultural interchange or advancement of knowledge about different places and its inhabitants and does not have a political or criminal purpose,"" Levin said. ""The people who rioted included insurrectionists and others who committed federal crimes for a political purpose to obstruct the legal operations of government. I hope people now don't just apply that logic to recast John Wilkes Booth as a theatergoer.""  Clyde said, ""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol … . If you didn't know the TV footage was from Jan. 6, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.""Clyde’s spokesperson pointed to a few moments of video of people walking through Statuary Hall snapping photos or videos. But those people were not engaged in anything that resembles tourism. They were part of a group who had violently breached the U.S. Capitol. Rioters that day assaulted police officers and vandalized the building, resulting in more than 400 people charged with crimes. This was no tourist visit, and there was nothing normal about it.This is a ridiculous statement. Pants on Fire! "

Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, who was standing at his lectern between Biden and Harris at the debate. Text above the photos reads, ""Anyone remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate: ‘You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars.’""There’s just one problem with the quote: According to transcripts of the Democratic debates, Harris never said it.We decided to look at the false claim and where it came from.The claim and the transcriptsThe image’s claim references allegations that swirled around Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the time leading up to the 2020 election. Hunter Biden had an investment deal that involved the Bank of China while his father was serving as vice president, which former President Donald Trump and other Republicans touted as an example of improper ethics and corruption.Trump repeatedly stated that the business deal made the Bidens more than $1 billion. The business deal remains murky because of minimal disclosure requirements for international investments, and nobody has been able to independently verify how much Hunter Biden made off the deal. During the first five Democratic debates, Harris never discussed any of the controversy surrounding the Bidens. Harris suspended her presidential campaign on Dec. 3, 2019, so she was not present for the six remaining Democratic debates.Her only significant comment on China came during the Sept. 12, 2019, debate in Houston, Texas, when she was asked how her trade policy would differ from former President Barack Obama by moderator George Stephanopoulos of ABC.""It's a complicated relationship,"" Harris said. ""We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable.""She added that the United States should also seek to partner with China ""on climate and the crisis that presents"" and ""on the issue of North Korea.""Harris did occasionally spar with Biden on stage, most notably in the first Democratic debate on June 27, 2019, when she said she ""wanted to speak on the issue of race"" and criticized Biden for his ""hurtful"" comments surrounding prominent segregationists and his opposition to busing.When Brown v. Board of Education was decided in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Berkeley Unified School District in Berkeley, California, implemented a busing program to integrate schools. Harris was part of the cohort that began kindergarten in the district during the second year of the program.We could find no evidence that Harris made any such statements elsewhere on the campaign trail. Her office declined to comment on the claim.Additionally, no other candidate made similar statements attacking Biden over allegations surrounding his son and China during any of the Democratic debates. Former President Donald Trump did attack Biden over China during two presidential debates.Our researchA search of the false quote turns up results dating back to January 2021. The earliest evidence of the quote on Facebook was posted on Jan. 24 and appears to have come from a page run by a group called Activated Patriots. The group protects ""freedom, God and guns"" and is based in Wisconsin, according to their website.The Activated Patriots post included the false quote, but in the post’s text, rather than in an image. It also included additional statements mischaracterizing several of Harris’s comments during the Democratic debates and on the campaign trail during and after her presidential bid. On April 29, the post was deleted from the Activated Patriots page. It had been shared more than 450 times.The false quote appears to have originated on Twitter on Jan. 23, less than 24 hours before the Activated Patriots post on Facebook, when @BlessUSA2024 tweeted it out. The pro-Trump account was created in September 2019 and has more than 26,000 followers as of April 30. It has previously shared misinformation related to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims there is a deep state run by political elites, business leaders and celebrities that engages in pedophilia and works against former President Donald Trump and his allies.PolitiFact reached out to Activated Patriots and the @BlessUSA2024 account for comment, but received no response.Our rulingSocial media posts claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris told President Joe Biden during the Democratic debates, ""You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars.""Transcripts of the debates show that this is wholly incorrect. Harris never made such a statement and rarely touched on China during the debates. When she did, she did not reference the murky allegations surrounding Biden’s son and his business dealings with Chinese companies.Harris made no such statements elsewhere on the campaign trail and none of Biden’s other competitors made similar comments. Furthermore, the quote has not been substantiated by any reputable news organization and appears to have originated on social media from pro-Trump accounts.Therefore, we rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Michigan didn't use an algorithm to manipulate 2020 election results","Antrim County, Michigan, the site of a human error that briefly produced inaccurate unofficial results on election night in November, remains the target of a misinformation effort that aims to sow doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election.Now, a new filing in the case claims a more far-reaching conspiracy, one in which the state government purportedly deployed a predetermined ""key"" to mathematically ""convert"" records of registered voters into counted votes.The filing cites an analysis by Douglas Frank, who chairs the math and science department at a school in Cincinnati, that claims to have discovered that Michigan and other battleground states each used a unique key.The filing defines the alleged ""key"" as a ""sixth degree polynomial"" that ""unlocks the door and uncovers the ability to manipulate data and results."" Frank’s analysis was filed as an exhibit in the case, and he explains his findings in a YouTube video that has received over 26,000 views. Frank says his work shows that ""elections are being decided at the state level.""How? ""Ballots are being harvested at the precinct level, regulated at the county level, and determined at the state level,"" he claims.The filings were submitted by Matthew DePerno, the lawyer for the Antrim County resident, who is accusing the county of mishandling the results on a marijuana-related proposal that was also on the November ballot.While the analysis is new, it boils down to a familiar falsehood: that Michigan’s 2020 election was tainted by widespread misconduct and fraud.In the filing, DePerno argues based on Frank’s finding that the number of ballots counted from Antrim and other counties tracks so closely with the vote totals predicted by the purported key, that they could not have occurred naturally without manipulation by the state.They claim the correlation proves that an algorithm had access to voting databases to determine the election result. Neither DePerno nor Frank provides any evidence for their claim of a state-level conspiracy to manipulate local results, other than the statistical correlation between ballots they claim were cast in the election and what the key — whose derivation they don’t explain — predicts.Gerrid Uzarski, elections director for Kent County, one of the counties examined by Frank, called the allegation ""very far-fetched.""And he questioned the analysis used to support the assertion.""I’m not sure where he got the numbers from,"" Uzarski said. ""I’ve looked for them myself. I have not been able to find the source.""Frank didn’t respond to emailed questions about how the key was generated, but he said he stood by his findings, which he said are based on information ""directly extracted from the databases provided by the state.""PolitiFact Michigan looked at data from the Secretary of State’s website and official county results and found problems with numbers Frank used and the conclusions he drew.For his analysis, Frank said in the video, he compiled voter demographics, registrations and ballots in nine Michigan counties — Antrim, Barry, Charlevoix, Grand Traverse, Kent, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne — and predicted the number of ballots cast using his key. In charts for each county, he breaks down the ballots cast by voters’ age. Trump won six of the counties analyzed by Frank.For each county, Frank provides a breakdown of the voting age population and compares it to the number of registered voters in the county and concludes that the number of registered voters in each county is near or exceeds the size of the voting age population. Ahead of the election, many counties did have more registered voters on their rolls than voting age residents. That can happen if the rolls aren’t updated to reflect people who have moved out of the county or died.That suggests that his analysis disregards registered voters who were added after that date — which was one month before Election Day — and the ballots they cast. Indeed, Frank acknowledges that his analysis of turnout and ballots cast counts only those who he says were registered by October. He refers to the other ballots as ""unregistered ballots,"" and alleges that these were ""injected"" at the last minute.But voters in Michigan can register to vote right up through and on Election Day, and thousands took advantage of this right in the November 2020 election. Election officials check to make sure that every ballot cast belongs to a registered voter and that every voter only votes once.Uzarski said the type of fraud Frank alleged would be an insurmountable task given Michigan’s highly decentralized election system.It would be impossible to cook up thousands of ballots that were invalidly cast, Uzarski said. ""There is not room for any kind of injection of ballots or injection of ghost voters or people who didn’t vote but people are voting for them.""David Becker, founder and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, called the allegations in the pleading ""fantastical.""In an email to PolitiFact Michigan, Becker explained that such a conspiracy would have had to be carried out by thousands of people and leave behind a mountain of evidence: meddling with the voter file, extra ballots that couldn’t be explained, voters who tried to vote but couldn’t because someone else had cast their ballots and audits confirming tabulators were tampered.""There is literally zero evidence of any conspiracy, involving thousands of people, in any state,"" including Michigan, Becker wrote.In a YouTube video, Frank claims his analysis of Michigan’s 2020 election results shows that the election outcome was decided at the state-level ahead of time using a mathematical ""key"" to manipulate vote totals.Frank offers no evidence for his claim other than a statistical correlation to this key, whose derivation he doesn’t explain. The figures he cites as the basis of his analysis are different from those in official records.Experts said the vote-manipulation effort Frank theorizes would involve a wide-ranging conspiracy that would not be possible under Michigan’s decentralized election system.We rate his claim Pants On Fire."

The data are overwhelming in the three vaccines that have been approved for use in an emergency use authorization, the J&J, the Pfizer, and the Moderna. You had 30,000, 44,000, and 40,000 people in the clinical trials, with an overwhelming signal of efficacy.

""Once they achieved high vaccination coverage, cases began to plummet.""Carlson said there are no good reasons for that. We found several, though.But the science on those questions is not settled, Watanabe said, and fears that newer variants could be more transmissible make additional safeguards important for now.In public spaces, there is no way to tell who is among the roughly 25% of the U.S. population that has been fully vaccinated. Some ""very vulnerable people"" remain at risk, Nichols said. ""Public health guidance on masks is not going to change until enough people are vaccinated because it is operationally very difficult to be able to tell who was vaccinated and who is not if you are, for example, working in a store,"" Adalja said.""Who is doubting that vaccines work? For the record, we never for a minute doubted it. We bought all of that stuff completely at face value. We believe in science,"" Carlson said, adding that he trusted the pharmaceutical companies behind the vaccines. ""The only reason we are asking the question is because the people in charge are acting like it doesn't work.""A Fox News spokesperson cited those comments and other examples of Carlson claiming to support vaccines, including when he said he’s ""not against it on principle"" during his April 13 segment and when he said March 30, ""I think of myself as pretty pro-vaccine myself."" Carlson said, ""Maybe (the COVID-19 vaccine) doesn't work, and they're simply not telling you that.""That claim is countered by clinical trials and real-world studies that show the available vaccines effectively protect against COVID-19 infections and severe symptoms. Carlson based his claim largely on the fact that the CDC still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear masks and keep their distance in public spaces. Carlson said he couldn’t think of a reason why the CDC would do that, but we found some pretty simple explanations.Experts said those precautions are advisable because most of the U.S. population remains unprotected and because scientists are still studying to what extent the vaccines stop transmission, among other things.We rate Carlson’s statement Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Liz Cheney’s dubious claim that just 6% of Biden plan is “infrastructure”,"As President Joe Biden seeks to win congressional support for his American Jobs Plan, Democrats and Republicans have been attacking each other over how they define the key element of the proposal: infrastructure.During the April 11 edition of the show, host Margaret Brennan reminded Cheney that in 2017, she supported President Donald Trump's infrastructure proposal. ""Nothing ever came of that, of course,"" Brennan said. ""But you liked the concept. Why are you opposed to it now?""Cheney responded, ""Well, it's a very different proposal, obviously. Something less than 6%, as you mentioned, of this proposal that President Biden has put forward is actually focused on infrastructure.""The difference is that McConnell, McCarthy and Scott specified that the 6% figure referred to spending on roads, bridges and highways. They were correct: Biden’s proposal calls for spending roughly that much on roads, bridges and highways.Cheney, on the other hand, used the broader term ""infrastructure,"" a word that would seem to encompass other provisions in the proposal, from railways and waterways to airports and the electric grid.We checked with Cheney’s office to see whether she had misspoken. In a statement to PolitiFact, they said she had not.""Roads, bridges, and highways are what constitutes 'infrastructure,'"" the statement said. It continued, ""When taken at what infrastructure is supposed to mean — rebuilding or investing in improvements for roads, bridges, and highways — under 6% of the Biden outline goes towards 'infrastructure.'""  However, outside experts questioned that narrow interpretation.""That’s not my definition,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-of-center American Action Forum. ""Mine is broader than hers.""A BNSF Railway train hauling carloads of coal from the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, seen east of Hardin, Mont., on July 15, 2020. (AP)It’s clear that some elements of Biden’s proposal do not fit a traditional definition of infrastructure, such as $400 billion devoted to expanding access to long-term, home and community-based care under Medicaid. But some experts see the administration as stretching the definition too far.""Much of what the president is calling ‘infrastructure’ consists of exercises in industrial policy,"" said James E. Moore II, director of the Transportation Engineering Program at the University of Southern California. Economists consider infrastructure spending to be ""money that generates a return, while industrial policy tends to be a losing proposition. The administration has picked a label for its spending plan that it hopes will deflect criticism.""Some other elements of the plan fall into a gray area, arguably fitting under some definitions of infrastructure. These include $590 billion for research and development and domestic manufacturing; $400 billion in clean energy tax credits; and $328 billion for capital investments in housing, schools, child care centers, veterans’ hospitals and other federal buildings.But other provisions would fall under the traditional umbrella of infrastructure, beyond the $115 billion for roads, bridges, and highways.These elements total $683 billion, which works out to about 26% of the $2.65 trillion proposal. That’s more than four times the 6% Cheney considers to be infrastructure.The categories totaling $683 billion are ""not only infrastructure but critical infrastructure,"" said Robert Greer, an associate professor in public service and administration at the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government and Public Service. ""As a Texan, we are acutely aware of energy system modernization issues given the recent rolling blackouts.""Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, agreed.""There is no reason to exclude traditional infrastructure categories — transportation, water resources, energy, and telecommunications — when assessing the American Jobs Plan,"" Tomer said. ""For decades, and in some case centuries, the federal government has supported direct investment in these physical capital systems and related policies like workforce development and planning grants.""When we asked the American Water Works Association what they thought of Cheney excluding their industry from her definition of ""infrastructure,"" legislative director Tommy Holmes said, ""I have often heard ‘roads and bridges’ being used as shorthand for all infrastructure, but I have never been in a serious discussion of the nation’s infrastructure that did not include the nation’s drinking water and wastewater systems.""Heat comes off the pavement near high-tension electrical lines in Los Angeles on Aug. 15, 2020.

""It is unfortunate she exaggerated her case.""Cheney said, ""Something less than 6% ... of this proposal that President Biden has put forward is actually focused on infrastructure.""The figure she cited applies to spending on roads, bridges and highways, but excludes items in Biden’s proposal that experts say are widely considered to be infrastructure, including public transit, rail, airports, ports, waterways, the electrical grid, drinking water systems and broadband.Moreover, her narrow definition of infrastructure contradicts her own repeated use of the word ""infrastructure"" in relation to bills that cover a wide range of matters beyond roads, bridges and highways.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Yes, the Texas Senate's election bill SB7 changes early voting rules","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stood before reporters during a Tuesday morning news conference in which he excoriated Democrats and many in the media for spreading ""lies"" about Senate Bill 7, a measure that would restrict voting access in the state.""The left, the Democrats, many in the media, some in this room, across the state, across the country, have changed the word sadly from ‘voter security’ to ‘voter suppression' or ‘voter restriction,’"" Patrick, a Republican, said angrily. ""Senate Bill 7 is about voter security not about voter suppression, and I’m tired of lies and the nest of liars who continue to repeat them.""Before explaining how the bill would amend the state election code, Patrick said something that he would repeat during the 35-minute press conference.""Nothing has changed in the election code (under SB7) regarding early voting. Nothing has changed,"" he said.SB 7 was passed along party lines by the Texas Senate last week and is one of two voting bills being considered by the Legislature. Similar to voting bills in Georgia and other states, SB 7 is designed to diminish local control over elections. The bill would prohibit local election administrators from extending early voting hours and operating drive-thru voting centers. It also would bar election officials from sending out mail-in ballot applications without a voter’s request and, among other things, gives partisan poll watchers more access to polling locations during voting hours.""People in America have lost faith in their elections,"" he said. ""We have to resolve that issue in this country and in this state. That’s why SB 7 is needed.""For this fact-check we focus on Patrick’s first claim — that SB 7 wouldn't change anything in the election code regarding early voting. Let’s look at how the bill would affect early voting.Patrick said during the news conference that many elements of the bill are targeted toward Harris County. Election officials in the state’s largest county opened eight 24-hour polling centers during a portion of the early voting period in areas with high numbers of overnight workers, near medical centers and the ship channel. The county also opened drive-thru voting locations during early voting to ease coronavirus concerns. Nearly 145,000 Texans availed themselves of these new voting options during the general election, which helped the county surpass its all-time record for number of votes cast before the early voting period was over.Patrick said that county officials had come up with these methods ""out of thin air"" and that they weren't explicitly allowed by state law. County officials counter that nothing in the law precluded 24-hour voting or drive-thru locations, and several GOP challenges last year to the expanded voting methods were unsuccessful.""24-hour early voting and drive-thru early voting were not included in the Election Code before Harris County decided to use them anyway. ... So, nothing has changed,"" said Patrick's spokesperson Steven Aranyi.If passed, SB 7 would codify Republicans' objections to drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting into the state election code. To Roxanne Werner, deputy director of communications for Harris County Elections, that's an appreciable change. ""There are definitely a number of things that would change under SB7, particularly with early voting. Some of the more obvious things are the drive-thru locations and the lack of extended early voting hours,"" Werner said. ""There are several things in SB 7 that relate to early voting, so I'm surprised to hear (Patrick’s) particular statement.""For instance, the bill’s text would eliminate 24-hour voting by adding language to the election code that requires early voting to be conducted ""for a period of at least nine hours, except that voting may not be conducted earlier than 6 a.m. or later than 9 p.m.""And it would prohibit drive-thru voting — during the early voting period or on election day — by adding language that says ""no voter may cast a vote from inside a motor vehicle.""Robert Stein, a Rice University political scientist who has worked with and studied Harris County’s election system, said the changes proposed in SB 7 are obvious.""What do you mean nothing changed?""

PANTS-FIRE,"Yes, data shows COVID-19 vaccines are safe despite quick timeline","State Rep. James Edming doesn’t trust the COVID-19 vaccine.He even told a Wisconsin Assembly committee, ""we should eliminate"" it.As lawmakers debated several bills that would prohibit mandatory vaccinations, Edming told of a friend whose wife died of cancer.""His wife was 70 years old, and 71 years ago, there was a vaccination that they gave women so they wouldn’t have a miscarriage, and his mother-in-law took that vaccination,"" Edming said. ""His mother-in-law died at age 70. His wife died at age 70, and their daughter is sterile.""That’s what the research has been able to follow up on in 70 years, and you think I’m going to take something because some scientist says that it’s good for me. And looking at and listening to what my friend has to say, there’s got to be a little more research before I take something. There may be a vaccination that’s for this, but you can’t tell me they can solve this in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that. There hasn’t even been any animal research on this.""Edming covers a lot of territory here. A few quick notes before we go deeper.His anecdote references a treatment that has indeed proven to have tragic, long-term consequences. But it wasn’t a vaccine, and it was developed in very different circumstances more than 80 years ago. More on this later.But we’ll focus mostly on the timing-based claim. Is it really not realistic to develop a safe vaccine in less than a year?The most obvious rebuttal to Edming’s claim is that millions of Americans have been safely vaccinated.But Edming’s criticism focused on the speed of the process, so let’s dig in to how the vaccines got to this point so quickly.That gets to the heart of where Edming goes wrong.The process that led to today’s COVID-19 vaccines is unlike anything that came before it. The unprecedented global consequences of the coronavirus pandemic spawned an equally unprecedented global cooperation in pursuit of a vaccine.""In public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, the development process may be atypical. For example, as demonstrated by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has coalesced government agencies, international counterparts, academia, nonprofit organizations and pharmaceutical companies to develop a coordinated strategy for prioritizing and speeding development of the most promising vaccines. In addition, the federal government has made investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at its own risk, giving companies confidence that they can invest aggressively in development and allowing faster distribution of an eventual vaccine. However, efforts to speed vaccine development to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have not sacrificed scientific standards, integrity of the vaccine review process, or safety.""Before we wrap up, let’s circle back to the anecdote Edming cited. It’s the same story he shared in a March 3 hearing before the Committee on Constitution and Ethics, where he recalled the friend’s deceased wife as an ""awesome, awesome lady.""Tyler Longsine, a research assistant for Edming, said they didn’t know the nature of the drug involved — despite Edming’s repeated use of the story.By 1953, research had shown DES did not prevent miscarriages or premature birth. But many doctors continued using it until research in early 1970s revealed children exposed to DES in utero were more likely to suffer from infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues — in line with Edming’s story.As tragic as this outcome was for Edming’s friend and countless other families, their situation is not comparable to the COVID-19 vaccine. DES was a medication, not a vaccine. And it was developed 82 years ago under looser standards that led it to be administered erratically.""The only similarity between DES and vaccines is that both may be given through injection,"" Murphy and Nolan said in their statement. ""We give many medications by injection — think of insulin, for example — and they have nothing to do with vaccines.""In a speech detailing his distrust of scientists and the COVID-19 vaccine, Edming said, ""You can’t tell me they can (develop a safe vaccine) in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that.""Edming leaned on criticism of a medical treatment — not a vaccine — developed in the 1930s and released without a fraction of the scientific scrutiny given to the COVID-19 vaccines.And in any case, his conclusion is contrary to the overwhelming medical consensus and what we can clearly see from the worldwide rollout. Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (with others on the way) were able to develop as quickly as they did due to a breakthrough vaccine mechanism, billions in federal funding and an array of bureaucratic fast-tracking that allowed faster production, simultaneous trials and timely approvals.Those vaccines were together tested on more than 100,000 people. And with millions of people now safely and effectively vaccinated, we see that safety claims made based on the trials were indeed valid. Which makes Edming’s claim ridiculous.We rate Edming’s claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"No, a CDC study did not find that mask mandates make no statistical difference on coronavirus rates","We interviewed three public health experts familiar with the study and a spokesperson from the CDC. They were unanimous: The article’s reading of the study is off-base. ""It’s not accurate at all to say that mask mandates played no role in decreasing COVID-19 case rates and deaths,"" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions. ""People are completely misunderstanding the study design if they are coming to that conclusion.""Both the study and the article were released as state governments considered lifting mask requirements, with five states — Texas, North Dakota, Mississippi, Iowa and Montana — opting to do so. We reached out to the author of the article but did not hear back. The main takeaway from the study was that ""mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates,"" said CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald. As evidence for its claims, the Texas Scorecard article quotes two sentences from the study out of context. ""Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,"" reads the first. The article takes the term ""reference period"" to refer to the period after the mask mandate was implemented. However, the report explicitly defines the ""reference period"" as the 20 days before the mask mandates started. ""When the authors (of the CDC study) say ‘daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,’ they mean that rates 60-21 days before mandates were not statistically different from those 20-1 days before the mandate,"" explained Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Nikolas Wada. The CDC study compared case rates from these two time periods to make sure that there wasn’t already a downward trend in coronavirus case and death rates before the mask mandate was implemented. According to McDonald, this helped the CDC to rule out other factors that could have accounted for the decrease. The Texas Scorecard article also quotes the following sentence from the CDC study out of context: ""Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1-20 and 21-40 days after restrictions were lifted."" The sentence appears at a point in the study that discusses the effect of indoor dining on coronavirus case and death rates. Although the study found that allowing restaurants to serve customers initially had a statistically insignificant effect on coronavirus case rates, the effect did gradually become statistically significant sometime between the 41st and 60th day after dining restrictions were lifted.Texas Scorecard wrote that a CDC study found that ""Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference"" on coronavirus case rates. That’s wrong and amounts to a ridiculous reading of a study that actually found the opposite: Mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.Pants on Fire! ​"

PANTS-FIRE,GOP’s McCarthy wrongly accuses Democrats of destroying 1 million energy jobs,"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy took to Fox News to highlight the damage purportedly wrought by Democrats since President Joe Biden took office. He summarized his comments in a tweet.McCarthy’s statement about 1 million energy jobs, which he also made in the Fox News interview, is way off.We reached out to McCarthy’s office for an explanation and did not hear back. The 1 million figure in his claim number aligns with a forecast from the American Petroleum Institute, a group that represents the oil and gas industry, but McCarthy misrepresented what the number means.Here’s why that doesn’t back up McCarthy’s claim:The study estimated total job losses, not energy job losses. The underlying model forecast a decline in the national economy, and translated that into an overall decline in employment. McCarthy spoke of 1 million energy jobs.Philip Jordan with BW Research tracks jobs in the energy sector for the National Association of State Energy Officials. Jobs in the oil, gas and coal industries have declined due to the pandemic downturn, Jordan said, but that was about 120,000 jobs, and took place before Biden took office.Jordan said that McCarthy’s number is implausible on its face.""The total of fossil fuel industries combined have about 1.6 million jobs,"" Jordan said. ""A million energy jobs lost? I think the math is impossible.""McCarthy said in the past two months, Democrats led by Biden have ""destroyed 1 million energy jobs.""The 1 million figure matches a number from an American Petroleum Institute report, but that report assumed all new oil and gas development on federal property would cease, while the Biden policy affects only new leasing.

PANTS-FIRE,Biden not to blame for rising diesel (or gas) prices,"A new party in the White House means it’s time for a time-honored American tradition — the blame game.Anything wrong in the world is now the fault of the two-month old administration. Or the fault of the prior administration, depending on your political persuasion.""When Sleepy Joe Came In Diesel Was $1.69,"" it reads. ""Today Diesel Is $3.19. Thanks To All That Voted For This Clown.""This poster gets it wrong on both the specifics and the blame. Here’s why.Diesel prices are indeed up. The March 15 national average of $3.07 was the highest since June 2019.But the numbers in the post are way off the mark.So, there was an increase, but a far smaller one.In Wisconsin, meanwhile, diesel rose from $2.50 to $2.90 between January 20 and March 10, according to GasBuddy.The poster did not respond to a message from PolitiFact Wisconsin seeking evidence of his claim. He lives in Iowa, according to his profile, but using local numbers doesn’t help his case much. GasBuddy shows prices in Des Moines rose over that span from $2.45 to $3.00 per gallon, a slightly larger jump, but still far from the post’s claim.The post — like many others pointing a finger at Biden over prices at the pump — is also wrong on the fundamental blame element. The price movement we’re seeing now on both diesel and gas isn’t related to Biden’s policy changes, experts say.For starters, the trend predates Biden. Diesel prices have steadily risen since the start of November, when Republican President Donald Trump was in office.The president also imposed a 60-day ban on new fracking permits, but that doesn’t affect existing operations. Oil producers weren’t likely to be pursuing new locations now anyhow since they’re scrambling to bring back online production that was scaled back in 2020, experts say.In reality, diesel and gas prices — like many things in 2021 — are all about the pandemic.Demand is now rising quickly as the COVID-19 picture improves and the economy rebounds, but it takes time to get the supply back to normal. The Energy Information Administration says crude oil production in the U.S. was down in 2020 and will drop again in 2021 ""as a result of a decline in drilling activity related to low oil prices."" It projects an increase in 2022.""We’re headed for higher (price) territory until the market sees more crude oil, whether that’s supplied from the U.S. or Canadian interests or OPEC,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy.com. ""We are in a pretty significant imbalance. Demand has screamed higher, and production has been moving at a turtle’s pace, and part of that is because the depths of the crisis were so severe for oil companies.""As Schouker noted, presidents have ""‘very little direct influence"" over gas and diesel prices. De Haan said the irony of blaming Biden is that the increasing demand is related to the growing economy. So the people prone to wrongly blame Biden for gas prices would also be slow to credit him for the economy, even though those are two sides of the same coin.A Facebook post claims Diesel prices have risen from $1.69 to $3.19 since Biden took office, blaming him for that jump.The numbers aren’t close to right — the actual increase was more like 40 cents, not $1.50.The blame element is equally off base. Diesel (and gas) prices are rising due to swelling demand as movement and economic activity increase amid the coronavirus recovery. Expert say it could take until 2022 for oil production to return to pre-pandemic levels, causing a shortage in the meantime that will drive prices up.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been paid $174,000 per year as a member of Congress since joining the House of Representatives in January 2019.A text image widely shared on Facebook claims that the New York Democrat now has a net worth of more than $1 million.The image states: ""2 years ago AOC was broke when elected. this yrs financials show she is now worth over 1 million net worth. How does that happen.""  The post is way, way off.Net worth is the value of a person’s assets — such as cash, home, stocks, bonds and other property — minus any debts owed.Members of Congress are required to file financial disclosure reports listing their assets, liabilities and income sources outside of their congressional salary. Ranges, rather than specific amounts, must be disclosed.Ocasio-Cortez has filed two financial disclosure reports with the House. Both show little or no net worth.For liabilities, the report showed student loan debt of between $15,001 and $50,000.In other words, it’s possible her liabilities exceeded her assets.The report also showed salary and wages from her campaign and a restaurant totaling $25,463 in 2018.A couple of footnotes: The only exceptions are the speaker of the House ($223,500) and the president pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate ($193,400).Ocasio-Cortez’s assets total no more than $31,000, according to her latest financial disclosure report. Based on the way personal finances are reported, they might be exceeded by her liabilities, which are reported to be as high as $50,000.An image shared on Facebook claiming she has a net worth of more than $1 million is false and ridiculous — Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump will not be re-inaugurated as president on Mar. 4, 2021","After President Joe Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, defying the predictions of QAnon supporters, some adherents of the conspiracy theory began to claim that his predecessor, Donald Trump, would actually be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021.In recent weeks, social media posts have echoed this theory in posts. Why does this date have relevance for some QAnon supporters? And how do their claims stack up against the evidence? But some QAnon adherents maintain that the 20th Amendment was never adopted and that any president sworn in on Jan. 20 is not a legitimate president, said Travis View, a disinformation researcher and host of the QAnonAnonymous podcast. According to Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University, the act consolidated the different neighborhoods of Washington into a single governing entity called a municipal corporation. However, some QAnon adherents believe that the statute effectively dissolved the U.S. government and turned the entire country into a business. Adherents of this theory believe all laws passed after 1871 are illegitimate, including the 20th Amendment, and all presidents since Ulysses S. Grant have held office illegally. As a result, some adherents maintain that Trump will return on March 4, the original inauguration date, and be sworn in as the 19th president of the restored United States.There’s no validity to the theory. The Organic Act of 1871 didn’t incorporate the entire United States. ""None of (the Organic Act) has anything to do with the rest of the United States, or the validity of any constitutional amendments or laws enacted after 1871,"" said Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University.""They’re calling it a false flag operation,"" View said. A Facebook post says Donald Trump will be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021.This conspiracy theory rests on a flawed interpretation of an 1871 bill that consolidated the different neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., into a single entity. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution changed the inauguration date from March 4 to Jan. 20. And on Jan. 20, 2021, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president for a term of four years.This claim is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire! ​"

A longer version of the video shows that Pelosi was accusing Republicans of using the ""wrap-up smear"" against Democrats running for office in the 2018 midterms. She was not laying out a blueprint of how to smear Republican opponents.  Here’s a transcript of the relevant passage from Pelosi’s press briefing, complete with the question she was answering when she made her ""wrap-up smear"" comment. The video takes Pelosi of context and misleadingly captions her remarks.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, the snow isn’t government-generated. This is what a snowball does when you take a lighter to it.","As strange winter weather brought frigid temperatures and snowfall as far south as Houston, some social media users were claiming that there’s something strange about the snow itself. ""It’s not even melting!"" one user exclaims. ""It’s just turning black!"" The users posit various explanations for this phenomenon: ""fake snow,"" alien technology, a simulated reality, and a massive government conspiracy. ""Anyone playing with the government-generated snow yet?"" reads a caption on one of the videos. We took a cold, hard look at these theories, and found that science has a better explanation. Many of the users seem to expect the snowball to melt away from the lighter flame as an ice cube would. However, ice and snow have distinct physical properties, which leads them to react to heat differently. Snow consists of frozen water droplets that have fallen to Earth. When snow is compressed into snowballs, there’s a lot of space between the crystals, making them soft and porous. Ice is denser and more rigid, with less space between the frozen water molecules. When an ice cube melts, there’s no space for the water droplets to go, so they end up dripping away. ""Think of ice like a glass window, where water bounces off, and a snowball like a window screen, where water can get through,"" Plait told PolitiFact. Here’s what’s happening in the videos: As the lighters heat up the snowballs, some of the snow begins to turn to water. However, that water gets absorbed into the remaining snow, making it seem like the snowball is shrinking in size rather than melting away. Given enough time, a snowball exposed to heat will melt into a puddle. However, the social media users hold lighters to the snowballs only long enough for black scorch marks to appear. As for the scorch marks? Those come from the lighters themselves. Lighters are typically fueled by butane, which is composed of carbon and hydrogen. When a lighter is flicked on, the butane molecules react with the oxygen in the air, releasing energy as heat. However, Plait explained, the reaction isn’t perfect, and some of the carbon molecules from the butane bond with one another to form soot. ""When (soot) is made in the videos it plates itself onto the snowball making it turn black,"" he said. There’s nothing strange or artificial about the snow in the videos. It’s probably best to let these claims melt away. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Tucker Carlson falsely blames Green New Deal, wind energy for Texas power outage","On Feb. 16, Fox News host Tucker Carlson placed the blame for the outage on renewable energy, paying particular attention to frozen windmills. PolitiFact reached out to several experts with knowledge of the Texas energy system. All of them strongly pushed back on Carlson’s assertions that renewable energy played a central role in the outage. ""The claim is devoid of facts and removed from reality,"" said Samuel Newell, an electricity expert at the Brattle Group, which has run detailed analyses of the Texas power grid. Fox News didn’t respond to a request for comment.  ""The idea that wind is responsible for these outages is actually just absurd,"" said Michael Webber, a mechanical engineering professor at UT Austin. ""It doesn’t match the facts on the ground, and it’s not what any energy expert would say.""""It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system,"" he said. As Webber put it, Texas is ""in a gas-dominated energy system."" During the outage, all sources of power generation in Texas were operating beneath normal levels, including wind. However, Webber said, ""the level of failure of the gas system is pretty spectacular.""Newell agreed with Webber, saying that the primary problem is that thermal power plants were not built to withstand the cold. They began to go offline just as freezing temperatures boosted the demand for heating, causing ERCOT to impose rolling blackouts. On Feb. 16, demand for power skyrocketed nearly 17 gigawatts past normal levels, while thermal generators lost more than 20 gigawatts of power, Newell said. By contrast, wind power output during daily energy peaks was about 2 gigawatts below the 7 gigawatts expected. ""Compared to the loss of thermal power, wind is a sideshow here,"" he told PolitiFact. Carlson said, ""Unbeknownst to most people, the Green New Deal came to Texas, the power grid in the state became totally reliant on windmills.""This is inaccurate on several levels. Texas’ energy supply is not ""totally reliant"" on wind energy. The central cause of the outage was a massive failure of thermal energy plants combined with a surge in demand for heat and other forms of power. While renewables are in the spirit of the Green New Deal, it hasn’t been enacted in Texas, or anywhere else.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"Yes, Ron Johnson attended the impeachment hearings","Social media hosted no shortage of debates amid former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment hearing, but a Feb 12, 2021, exchange centering around U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, was particularly unexpected.U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, said Johnson was a no-show on what turned out to be the second-last day of the proceedings.It prompted an expected dose of Twitter outrage, with posters condemning Johnson and saying he shouldn’t be able to vote if he didn’t show up.So who’s right?Pinning down attendance is tricky since the hearing took place in the Senate Chamber, but that wasn’t the only way for senators to watch the proceedings.The Senate adopted a resolution allowing senators to leave and watch from the upstairs gallery or from an adjacent room by television. So a senator being absent from the floor for a time doesn’t mean they weren’t watching.Pocan’s assertion that Johnson wasn’t there stemmed from a tweet by author Don Winslow, who has more than 600,000 followers on Twitter. The tweet showed pictures of Johnson and 13 other senators, describing them as ""the Senators that chose not to attend the impeachment trial today.""  It was retweeted more than 10,000 times before Winslow deleted it sometime Feb. 12.This tweet was spreading widely in the middle of the day Feb. 12, so many interpreted it to be referencing Feb. 12, but the Senate proceedings didn’t begin until 11 a.m. central, about 10 hours after this tweet was sent.We’ll examine both days.In an email to PolitiFact the evening of Feb. 12, Voelkel said his understanding is that Johnson ""has been there the entire time.""But we don’t have to take his word for it.Pocan’s office provided no evidence that Johnson was absent either day. Spokesman Usamah Andrabi said the office has ""first-hand reports of him being out of the room at times,"" but with viewing setup from multiple locations that doesn’t prove this claim. Andrabi also asserted the ""focus"" of the tweet was on Johnson’s COVID conspiracy theories, though that doesn’t ring true given the post was a quote retweet of a claim about Johnson’s attendance.Pocan told Johnson to ""do your damn job and show up,"" retweeting a claim that Johnson wasn’t present for that day’s impeachment proceedings.The timeline is a bit odd here, since the tweet that spurred this discussion likely was referencing Feb. 11, but it was being shared and debated in many cases as if it referenced to Feb. 12. In either case the now-deleted tweet was wrong about Johnson.We don’t know what Johnson was doing every moment of every day, but we have photographic proof he was at the Capitol for the Feb. 11 and Feb. 12 impeachment hearings. That makes a claim he didn’t ""show up"" absurd.

I mean armed, when you hear armed, don’t you think of firearms?"" Johnson said. ""Here’s the questions I would have liked to ask. How many firearms were confiscated? How many shots were fired? I’m only aware of one, and I’ll defend that law enforcement officer for taking that shot.""Johnson is couching this as an opinion, but he’s attempting to make a factual case that Jan. 6 wasn’t an ""armed insurrection."" So let’s review the evidence on that point.Johnson prefaced this comment by claiming that Democrats are painting a picture of every Trump voter being a violent rioter. Certainly not everyone in the crowd was armed. And many clearly came intending only to peacefully protest.But claiming this was not an armed insurrection goes well behind this line of thinking.Many in the crowd attacking the Capitol have said their intent was to stop the vote confirmation and keep Trump in office despite the election results. That’s an insurrection.That leaves us with his objection to the word ""armed.""Yes, carrying a gun would constitute being armed. But the definition of the word is much more broad, referring simply to carrying a weapon. So the question is whether this insurrection involved people carrying weapons.And it certainly did.First off we’ll note that any reports of weapons at the Capitol will greatly understate the quantity that was likely there. Only 75 people were arrested that day, and police weren’t doing any widespread searches that would have identified weapons on others present, NBC News notes.But news and official reports are filled with accounts of armed people at the Capitol.Fourteen people tied to the Jan. 6 attack are facing federal charges related to bringing or using dangerous weapons inside the building and two are facing firearms-related charges, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.NBC News reported that within a week after the attack a dozen guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition had been found on seven people arrested before and after the Capitol riot.In the trunk of Lonnie Coffman’s vehicle, police found an AR-15-style rifle, a shotgun, a crossbow, several machetes, smoke grenades and 11 Molotov cocktails, Reuters reported. Another man, Christopher Alberts of Maryland, was stopped as he left the Capitol grounds after a police officer spotted a loaded handgun on his hip.Many more people armed themselves by more unorthodox means, causing damage and injury.Not to mention pipe bombs were found near the Capitol at Republican and Democratic party headquarters.Johnson’s staff did not immediately return an email seeking evidence or explanation of his claim.Johnson said the Jan. 6 Capitol riot ""didn’t seem like an armed insurrection.""That’s ridiculous revisionist history.Overwhelmed police arrested and had direct contact with only a fraction of the mob that day, but we still can identify accounts of numerous weapons found in and around the Capitol, brought there in some cases by people who saw themselves as soldiers in a war. And many other rioters used whatever hard objects they could find to attack police and force their way into the Capitol.A majority of senators, through the impeachment vote, put the blame on Trump for stirring up the riot, though others debate the ""why"" question for the events of Jan. 6. But the ""what"" question shouldn't be debated. It was an armed insurrection.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

If members of Congress violated federal law, they would most likely be arrested by the FBI or a federal marshal, she added.Vladeck and Cohn said some National Guard members who provided security for Biden’s inauguration in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol were given arrest authority.Vladeck pointed out that if two-thirds of Congress had been arrested, word somehow would have leaked out.""Simply put, this is all just nuts,"" he said.The Department of Defense did not respond to our emails seeking comment.The article makes other unsubstantiated claims, including that the United States ""has been functioning under martial law"" since Jan. 9 as a result of an order by then-President Donald Trump.The federal Insurrection Act empowers the president to deploy the military and federalize National Guard troops to suppress certain situations including civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion.

(It also misspells Ashli Babbitt’s name.)In the video, Ganaha points out what she considers to be signs of antifa involvement. Shortly before Babbitt’s shooting, Ganaha says, one rioter, who is wearing a yellow flag like a cape, hands a helmet to another rioter, who uses it to begin to smash the glass on the door to the Speaker’s Lobby.

Of course, this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how news reporting works — the situation began as a protest and turned into a historically unprecedented attack on the seat of U.S. government. So yes, news reports from essentially everywhere were updated as that story developed.) The first logical hurdle Wichmann fails to clear is that the video itself doesn’t remotely prove his assertion, which was made in the video description.But a poor response from police is a far cry from proving the protesters themselves are not who they purport to be.But Wichmann takes a ridiculous logical leap in interpreting one apparently friendly interaction with police as proof the people in the Capitol weren’t actually Trump supporters.Especially when a mountain of evidence says otherwise.The mob that broke windows inside and outside the Capitol and violently pushed past police moved to the building after a rally earlier that morning where Trump spoke to the group.Here are a few of the many reasons the antifa claims don’t hold water.The tweet, claiming a busload of ""antifa thugs"" had been dropped off at the Capitol, has since been deleted and remains completely unsubstantiated. The newspaper has since retracted the report, and the company it cited as a source, XRVision, has said its software identified two members of a Neo-Nazi organization and a Q-Anon supporter, not members of antifa.Meanwhile, many individuals seen in news and social media footage have been identified, and have lengthy public histories of backing Trump, QAnon and other far-right causes. And of course, Trump himself identified the mob as his own supporters in a video posted to Twitter amid the Capitol incident, where he asked them to disperse peacefully, adding, ""We love you.

The activist also referred to hospital staff as ""useful idiots."" A hospital representative rejected the video’s assertions as baseless. The footage mostly shows the hospital’s deserted outpatient center. But this is not where COVID-19 patients arrive, as pointed out by some of the comments on the video. Most patients arrive through separate ambulance and emergency department entrances, said Gwendolyn Driscoll, spokesperson for MLK Jr. Community Hospital.""There is no substance whatsoever to her allegations,"" Driscoll wrote in an email, referring to the activist. The hospital is located in a mostly Black and Latino south L.A. neighborhood where many residents are essential workers who are continually exposed to COVID-19. It also serves some unhoused individuals. The hospital is considered among the hardest hit in Southern California, where post-holiday COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed. Converting ‘Every Nook And Cranny’ To Patient SpaceTo fact check the video’s claim, we relied on statements and data from officials at MLK Jr. Community Hospital, along with other health and emergency service officials. We also reviewed recent news reports, photos and videos showing the impact of the COVID-19 surge on hospitals in the L.A. area. The Facebook video shows the both the outpatient center and the main entrance to MLK Jr. Community Hospital. There’s little activity at either location. Driscoll, the hospital spokesperson, said that’s because these ""are not patient areas"" and few COVID-19 patients come in through the main doors. She also cited a data analysis showing MLK Jr. Community Hospital had the highest rate of COVID-19 patient volume to hospital bed capacity of any nearby hospital in late December. It shows 97% of its 131 licensed beds were being used by COVID-19 patients the week before Christmas, a higher rate than each of the dozens of other hospitals within 15 miles. SOURCE: MLK Jr. Community Hospital‘Every Bed Occupied By A Ventilated COVID Patient’Staff at MLK Jr. Community Hospital aren’t the only ones dealing with the impacts of the area’s coronavirus surge. ""When you walk into the ICU, and you see every bed occupied by a ventilated COVID patient, with tubes coming in all orifices of their body, you begin to understand that we are not dealing with what we were dealing with 10 months ago,"" Spellberg said in the Times article.There was not one available bed for at least 30 patients who needed intensive or intermediate levels of care, Spellberg added in the article, and the hospital had to shut its doors to all ambulance traffic for 12 hours.In this Dec. 17, 2020, photo, medical tents are set up outside the emergency room at UCI Medical Center in Irvine, Calif.

""Ambulances are still having to wait many hours to offload patients to the emergency room."" Our RulingThat claim is a far cry from reality.

""This is a common occurrence,"" Conklin said. Madison County uses a state registry to determine whether any of the registered voters who voted early died before Election Day. ""It is not uncommon,"" Egger said. ""It’s something we check every election, and it does happen.""We reached out to election commissioners in all of the 22nd Congressional District’s eight counties. Half of the counties responded, and they said they were not aware of any person who tried to impersonate a dead person in order to vote. In Chenango County, some ballots were returned to the board because the voter had died, said Commissioner Carol Franklin. This happens because people who are on a list to receive an absentee ballot for every election because they have a disability and then die are not promptly removed from the list. There were no instances of someone impersonating a dead person, Franklin said. Cortland County pulled six ballots after they were cast because the voters died before Election Day, said Commissioner Robert Howe. In Tioga County, Commissioner James Wahls said they had no known instances where a voter cast an absentee ballot and died before Election Day. Registered voters who vote by absentee ballot and die before Election Day is not an instance of fraud, said Sean Morales-Doyle, who studies elections and is a deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center. ""I think the fact that an election official catches the fact that someone died after they cast their ballot but before Election Day is a sign the system is working,"" he said. In a decision and order on Dec. 8, State Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte wrote: ""To be clear, there is absolutely no evidence -- or even an allegation -- before this Court of any fraud on the part of the Boards or the campaigns."" The Tenney campaign said that absentee ballots overwhelmed boards of election, and provided to PolitiFact photos of ballots that were sent to people who had died, and obituaries to corroborate their deaths. These ballots were not filled out by anyone. The number of absentee ballots ""made it extremely difficult for officials to verify that every ballot was properly cast by a legal (and living) voter,"" said Sean Kennedy, spokesman for the Tenney campaign. ""In this election, multiple ballots were cast by people who were deceased on Election Day,"" Kennedy said. ""Due to insufficient safeguards and the massive volume of mail-in ballots to process, we do not know how many more went undetected and are considered valid votes. Fortunately, the local boards excluded those votes but unfortunately our opponent has now asked that a dead voter’s ballot be counted.""Tenney wrote ""Dead people also voted"" when retweeting a claim implying that something ""fishy"" is going on in ballot-counting in New York. It is accurate that living people cast ballots and died before Election Day, according to several election commissioners across the district’s eight counties. Ballots from these known individuals are not part of a board’s vote tally. In the case of a single ballot in Madison County set aside because election officials found an obituary causing them to believe the voter died, Brindisi’s campaign is asking that a death certificate be produced before that ballot is disregarded from the count. It will be up to the court to decide whether to count that ballot. It is possible that boards of election do not catch every instance of a voter dying after they cast their ballot but before Election Day. In addition, voters who vote early on machines at polling places and die before Election Day have their votes counted. It’s unclear how often this happened in this race, if it happened at all.  But Tenney offers no proof that anyone used the identities of dead people to cast fraudulent votes, or that ballots cast by voters who died before Election Day are included in the tally. Photos of unfilled ballots are not evidence of voter fraud. The court is dealing with other problems related to timely and accurate ballot counting. Dead people voting isn't one of them. "

""It’s a serious virus, but it’s a virus; it’s not a pandemic.""COVID-19 is not a pandemic? Let’s check.Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was appalled by Good’s statement.Giroir said he’d be happy to provide Good with ""technical assistance"" to understand the pandemic.We ran a quick search of 10 science and health authorities around the world and found each one describes COVID-19 as a pandemic.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, the new coronavirus vaccines are not more dangerous than COVID-19","The post also erroneously claims that the vaccine contains toxic ingredients like aluminum, mercury ""and possibly formaldehyde,"" and then concludes that, ultimately, receiving the shot is more harmful than contracting the disease itself.""Here’s my bottom line: I would much rather get a COVID infection than get a COVID vaccine,"" reads the post, which accompanies an image of a man wearing a white physician’s coat. ""That would be safer and more effective.""Two problems: The list of ingredients cited in the post appears to be pulled from thin air. And a mountain of evidence shows that getting infected with the virus is far more dangerous than the vaccines. The vaccines have been studied for months and have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people. COVID-19, by contrast, has killed over 1.6 million people around the world.None of the supposedly toxic ingredients listed in the Facebook post appears in the list. The mRNA used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines represent a new vaccine technology, but the research behind it has been underway for some time.  ""It's not a novel strategy,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ""This particular notion of using messenger RNA in a vaccine has been around for 20 years. This is just the first product to get above the water to become a commercial project.""Traditional vaccines introduce an inactivated or weakened version of a virus for the body to fight against. By contrast, Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines use messenger RNA, which is a fragment of the virus’ genetic material. It works by giving the body instructions to produce copies of the protein present on the surface of the coronavirus, without causing sickness from the disease. The immune system then learns to recognize the protein and produce antibodies against it.Before injection, the vaccine is mixed with the saline solution, just as many intravenously delivered medicines are, the report said.K. ""Vish"" Viswanath, a professor of health communication at Harvard’s School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the post uses common anti-vaccine tactics, such as using what he calls ""scientistic"" language, as he calls it, and claiming it comes from someone credible. ""This kind of tactic to list ingredients that may or may not be there is not new. Anti-vaccine groups have always used a list of ingredients even after ingredients have been eliminated from vaccines,"" Viswanath said. ""They misinterpret and distort scientific data to advance their agenda.""Some people who get vaccinated may develop mild or moderate symptoms as their immune system responds, including headache, soreness or fever, but these side effects are short-lived and not considered serious or life-threatening. Some skeptics of the vaccine have pointed to the high survival rates for some groups of people who contract COVID-19. But the vaccine isn’t intended just to prevent deaths, health experts note. It’s also about preventing the spread of the virus and infections that could lead to significant long-term health issues. While the vaccines were developed in record time, they went through rigorous review processes before they were deemed suitable for public use. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, called the post irresponsible.""Where is the data? How can they claim that the vaccines are contaminated with these agents?"" Iwasaki wrote in an email. ""Getting the vaccine is absolutely not more dangerous than contracting the disease.""The safety of both Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines have been rigorously tested with no serious concerns. COVID-19 has (a) case fatality rate of 2.3%. Vaccine, zero.""The U.S. has not reached herd immunity that would significantly hinder the spread of the disease, as the post suggests.""I would say 50% would have to get vaccinated before you start to see an impact,"" Fauci told the outlet. ""But I would say 75% to 85% would have to get vaccinated if you want to have that blanket of herd immunity.""There isn’t enough information yet to say if or for how long someone is protected after they recover from the disease. Some early evidence suggests that natural immunity may not last very long, but more studies are still needed. The vaccine is expected to provide stronger and likely longer-lasting immunity.A Facebook post that makes several unsubstantiated claims about the new coronavirus vaccines says the shots contain toxic ingredients and are more dangerous than getting COVID-19.This is bogus. The ingredient lists for the vaccines do not include any of the ""toxic"" contents listed in the post, and the leading vaccines — which have been tested for several months in thousands of people — are not more dangerous than the virus, which has killed over 300,000 Americans and more than 1.6 million people worldwide.Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Mask guidance for vaccinated people is based in science,"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter Tuesday to challenge the latest coronavirus guidance as vaccines were being distributed around the country.Cruz responded specifically to Dr. Vin Gupta, a lung and intensive care unit doctor who appeared on MSNBC to caution vaccine recipients against abandoning the kinds of preventative measures public health experts have been emphasizing all year.  ""This is one of the misperceptions here: just because you get vaccinated with a second dose, it does not mean you should be participating in things like traveling in the middle of an out-of-control pandemic or that you’re liberated from masks,"" Gupta told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd. ""Everything still applies until all of us get the two-dose regimen, and we don’t think that’s going to happen until June or July."" Many unknowns surround the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. For instance, it’s unclear if vaccinations strictly protect infected people from serious illness, or if they also prevent people from getting infected, Gupta said.""Don’t let your guard down just because you got vaccinated,"" he said. ""You might be able to get infected by the virus and pass it on to others.""The comment was enough to peeve Cruz, who has previously criticized guidance to wear masks and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.""This is a bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult,"" Cruz said in a tweet responsive to Gupta’s mask-wearing advice. ""It’s not about vaccines or protecting people’s lives — it is instead profoundly anti-science, and is only focused on absolute govt control of every aspect of our lives.""In July, Cruz faced criticism after he was photographed maskless on an American Airlines flight one month after the airline required passengers to wear face masks while onboard planes.Cruz stirred controversy again when he called Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, ""a complete ass"" for asking a fellow senator to wear a mask while speaking. And in November, as Texas public health officials urged people to avoid large holiday gatherings as daily case numbers reached record highs, Cruz tweeted a graphic with the words ""Come and take it"" beneath a Thanksgiving turkey.So is the latest round of COVID-19 guidance — urging continued mask-wearing and discouraging travel — ""profoundly anti-science"" as Cruz claims?""I think [Cruz] is talking beyond his knowledge,"" said Dr. Jaquelin Dudley, professor of molecular biosciences and associate director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas.""This whole thing about mask-wearing, taking a vaccine and social distancing has somehow become a political football instead of, let's just talk about what we know and what we don't know,"" she said.Cruz’s office did not respond to a request for clarification on precisely what the senator meant by ""anti-science."" And a spokesperson for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the organization for which Gupta works, declined to address Cruz’s comments in an effort to remain apolitical. (""With the issue at hand — responding to comments by a U.S. senator stating that protective measures against COVID-19 constitute ""bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult"" — it would be impossible to make this apolitical,"" a spokesperson said.)But the guidance highlighted by Gupta is the same messaging that has come from the very top level of the U.S. coronavirus response apparatus. On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Donald Trump’s top adviser on the coronavirus crisis, spoke before an online audience and gave the same cautionary advice.""It’s not going to be like turning a light switch on and off. It’s not going to be overnight. It’s going to be gradual. ... I don’t believe we’re going to be able to throw the masks away and forget about physical separation and congregant settings for a while, probably likely until we get into the late fall and early next winter, but I think we can do it,"" he said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advises that there is not enough information ""to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others,"" suggesting that more time is needed for experts to understand how the virus will respond to vaccinated persons.According to Dr. Jonathan Temte of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, the clinical trials of the vaccine have only looked at how the vaccine prevents illness. Those trials didn’t provide any information on transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could still carry and spread the virus.It takes repeat exposures for the immune system to learn how to best fight off a virus, which is why COVID-19 vaccinations require two doses about three weeks apart, according to the CDC. Clinical trials through the National Institutes of Health tell us that the immune system begins to create a beta version of antibodies after a person receives the first dose of the vaccine. These are the body’s least optimal version of these antibodies. Phase III trials — which test for vaccine efficacy — indicate these initial antibodies are capable of fighting off severe illness caused by the virus, but may be less capable of preventing the virus’ spread. A second dose of the vaccine helps the body create a new version of antibodies more honed in on fighting COVID-19. A person’s immune system is most capable of fighting off COVID-19 about one month after the initial dose of vaccine. ""Your body learns. You can’t assume that on day one after the vaccine you’re going to be protected and you’re not going to be able to spread the infection,"" Dudley said.""We don’t have that data yet. There’s been so many things to learn,"" she said.This is one of the primary sources of uncertainty surrounding the vaccine: whether vaccinated people can be contagious. If vaccinations protect only against illness and not transmissions, achieving herd immunity through vaccination becomes more difficult, according to the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet.""Pfizer and Moderna together project that there will be enough vaccines for 35 million individuals in 2020, and perhaps up to 1 billion in 2021,"" The Lancet wrote. ""As a result, many millions of people at high risk of disease will not be immunized any time soon, necessitating the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions.""Furthermore, it’s also unknown how long immunity will last in a vaccinated person, or how effective vaccination will be in older people or those with underlying comorbidities.The guidance issued by the CDC that urges vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and avoid travel was described by Cruz as ""profoundly anti-science.""The emerging vaccines each were placed through months of clinical trials that tested for their efficacy in preventing illness. Their efficacy in preventing transmission was not part of the trials and is not yet known. The guidance issued by the public health community is borne out of science’s blind spots in regard to transmission and the gradual pace of vaccine distribution.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, a 2018 executive order doesn't allow Trump to unilaterally impose martial law","Social media users are voicing a theory that President Donald Trump planned to invoke a 2018 executive order to impose martial law by Friday, Dec. 18. There are varying definitions of martial law, and many of the purveyors of this particular theory don’t specify what form they expect it to take. However, their descriptions seem to reflect martial law at its most extreme: the suspension of civil authority and military control of civilian functions such as the courts. PolitiFact spoke to six scholars of constitutional law and presidential power and asked them whether the executive order allows Trump to declare martial law. They were unanimous: It doesn’t.""There is literally nothing in the executive order that allows for any kind of use of military force where it isn’t already authorized by statute,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a leading expert in martial law. ""The statutory authorities that the executive order invokes would not extend to declaring martial law,"" said Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford Law School professor. ""It’s painful to hear about this theory, both because it’s not based in fact and because it’s dangerous to be thinking this way,"" said Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University.The 2018 executive order at the center of the claim allows the president to impose sanctions on foreign entities or individuals who have interfered in a U.S. election. It was signed amid reports that the Russian government had attempted to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election and help Trump’s electoral efforts. ""Basically, what (the executive order) does is allow people in the executive branch to impose economic sanctions on foreign actors interfering in the election,"" said Edelson. ""How you get from there to imposing martial law, I don’t know. It doesn’t make any sense.""Any executive order that gave the president the authority to unilaterally invoke martial law would be unconstitutional, the scholars we spoke with said. ""The president has no ability to unilaterally authorize himself to impose martial law, just as he could not issue an executive order allowing himself to decide judicial cases or controversies,"" said Daniel Kobil, a law professor at Capital University Law School. Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has no inherent authority to declare martial law except under the extreme circumstances of a rebellion or foreign invasion, said Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School. ""Losing an election doesn’t count as a basis for invoking this power,"" Feldman added. In 1866, the Supreme Court ruled in the case Ex parte Milligan that martial law cannot be imposed where civil courts are open and functioning. As a result, one should think of martial law as a state of affairs arising from a total breakdown of civil order, Vladeck said. ""The president has a handful of statutory authorities to use the military for domestic law enforcement, but none of those authorities allow for the ‘imposition’ of martial law, versus using the military to restore order in situations in which civilian authorities are unable or unwilling to do so.""""If the president and Congress disagree, Congress wins, unless the Constitution gives the president ‘conclusive and preclusive’ authority over the issue. And in the case of martial law, it’s the opposite of conclusive and preclusive,"" Nunn said.And if a president attempted to unilaterally impose martial law to secure a second term for himself in the absence of an invasion or rebellion?""We have a technical term for that,"" said Feldman. ""It’s called a coup d’etat. It would be criminal.""Social media posts say that a 2018 executive order gives Trump the power to impose martial law. Six scholars of constitutional law and presidential power told us that the executive order doesn’t give the president the power to impose martial law. Under the Constitution, the president does not have the power to unilaterally impose martial law. We rate this Pants on Fire!"

Let’s take them one by one.From the ""World at Risk"" report: ""The United Nations (including WHO) conducts at least two system-wide training and simulation exercises, including one for covering the deliberate release of a lethal respiratory pathogen."" This is not a nefarious secret tucked away deep in a bureaucratic report. The World Health Organization helps organize simulation exercises of public health emergencies to test how prepared communities and systems are to handle such crises. The scenario revolved around an influenza outbreak with the potential to turn into a pandemic in a made-up country called Mizzou off the coast of North America. But there was no actual virus; the simulation exercise took place online and within the offices of WHO emergency operation centers. The point of the exercise was to test plans and procedures, and identify problems that could occur in an actual pandemic — like the one we’re experiencing now.Now, let’s look at the FDA instructions on how to use a COVID-19 test. The post includes an image of a highlighted section from a highly technical portion of the FDA document and concludes that the passage proves the tests were faked. ""On Dec 1st 2020,"" the posts says, ""the CDC released a report, and part of it includes how THE VIRUS WAS NOT ISOLATED - meaning the tests were completely faked. They were all spiked with ‘positive’ virus samples to show a positive - straight from the laboratory samples, in order to produce something tangible for the simulation.""We reached out to the CDC about the claim. Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson with the agency, told us that the FDA instructions featured in the Facebook post reflect a COVID-19 test that was developed before the CDC had a live virus. The instructions are not evidence that the pandemic is a simulation.  CDC developed the test using genomic sequencing information because it didn’t yet have a live virus or samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, Nordlund said. By Jan. 18 it was using this test on samples from people with suspected cases of COVID-19. A few days later, the CDC used a sample from the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States to start growing the virus. By Jan. 31, there were six confirmed cases in the United States and the CDC asked the FDA for emergency use authorization to distribute its test to other public health laboratories. The FDA granted that request on Feb. 4.For many, news that COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in the United States and elsewhere in the world came as a relief.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump wrong in multiple ways on Wisconsin absentee ballot applications,"President Donald Trump continued his evidence-free assault on the validity of the 2020 election during a Dec. 2, 2020, speech, taking aim at Wisconsin several times.One claim zeroed in on a favorite Trump target — absentee voting — to assert the paperwork behind those ballots was lacking.The claim, included in a list of supposed election fraud examples, was made without any further detail or evidence.As with Trump’s many lawsuits seeking to overturn the election results in Wisconsin and elsewhere, this claim flies in the face of reality.Here’s why.For starters, Trump got the number wrong.Since the claim in this speech doesn’t provide much context, we reached out to Trump campaign spokeswoman Courtney Parella to explain the 70,000 figure. She declined to elaborate aside from referring to the campaign’s Wisconsin lawsuit.So Trump meant to say 170,000, not 70,000.But that’s the least of his issues with the truth.But that statute doesn’t include specific requirements.That reference in state law simply says municipal clerks shouldn’t issue an absentee ballot ""unless the clerk receives a written application therefor (sic) from a qualified elector of the municipality."" It details no requirements for what that application should include.Reid Magney, spokesman for the state elections commission, confirmed there are no requirements in state law on the nature of absentee ballot applications, leaving that detail to the commission to decide. And the commission has required an application for every ballot.""To claim that there is no application on file for these absentee ballots is false,"" Magney said.The commission created the combined certificate and application in 2010 after complaints following the 2008 presidential election that in-person absentee voting was inefficient and involved too much paperwork. Trump claims in his speech (and a lawsuit) that ""70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law.""Every part of this is wrong.Trump was actually referring to a group of 170,000 votes, not 70,000.And that group of in-person absentee voters did indeed fill out an application in order to cast their ballot. It was part of the ballot certificate on the envelope, but that doesn’t make it any less valid since state statute doesn’t specify the nature of that application.It’s the same approach that’s been used without issue in Wisconsin elections since 2010 — including the 2016 presidential contest that Trump won.We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Lawsuit claim that statistics prove fraud in Wisconsin, elsewhere is wildly illogical","Nonsense dressed up in statistical jargon is still nonsense.A claim gaining particular traction online purports to calculate the likelihood of those four states — all won by Democrat Joe Biden — shifting away from President Donald Trump, who lead earlier in the vote-counting process.But statistical calculations are only as good as the assumptions underpinning them, and Cicchetti’s are wildly wrong.Let’s take a closer look.Cicchetti’s analysis flops because he makes the same error in multiple ways — assuming any two large groups of voters should generate substantially similar results.Of course, we know this to be ridiculous.Groups can split drastically by geography. In Wisconsin, for example, Milwaukee County and Ozaukee County are next to each other, but one went 69% for Biden and the other 55% for Trump because demographics in the two counties are very different.So a key part of understanding why early and late returns differ is looking at where those votes came from and how they were cast. This claim ignores that question altogether to treat each vote as if it were a coin flip.Kenneth Mayer, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said Cicchetti’s approach is ""ludicrous.""""The analysis assumes that votes are all independently and randomly distributed,"" he said in an email. ""This is going to be used in undergraduate statistics classes as a canonical example of how not to do statistics.""The observed party split by voting method is key to understanding the absurdity of this claim.Cicchetti’s defense — in a description of his methodology attached to the lawsuit — focuses primarily on Georgia, noting Trump was leading 51% to 49% at 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 but wound up narrowly losing the state.""The Georgia reversal in the outcome raises questions because the votes tabulated in the two time periods could not be random samples from the same population of votes cast,"" Cicchetti says.He’s so close to getting it right, but ends up so very wrong.The issue is indeed that votes from before and after that point can’t be random samples. But it’s not because of fraud as the lawsuit asserts — it’s because of which votes were counted when.Cicchetti’s explanation says there was ""speculation"" that those last ballots counted were absentee ballots, but he wasn’t ""aware of any actual data supporting that."" That, of course, is ridiculous and false.We knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later.This causes a bottleneck particularly in the biggest counties — which are, of course, centered around heavily Democratic cities. Those areas were long expected to be the last to report their results, and that’s just what happened with results from around Atlanta, Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia.Cicchetti’s methodology doesn’t defend his ""one in a quadrillion"" number specifically for Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan aside from noting each state had between 69% and 89% of the vote tabulated before the latest reports. He says that leaves a large enough sample size of uncounted ballots that we should ""expect comparable percentages and vote margins"" before and after that point.Again, this ignores the indisputable fact that those were votes from dramatically different groups of voters.As a quick aside, we’ll note the lawsuit makes a similar claim of a ""less than one in a quadrillion"" chance that Biden would perform as he did in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania given Democrat Hillary Clinton’s performance in those states in 2016.That’s equally ridiculous.It’s completely unclear where this number comes from. Particularly since Biden’s improvements over the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, were fairly modest in those four states. Clinton lost to Trump by about 290,000 votes across the four states; Biden won them by about 270,000. That’s a swing of about a third of a percentage point relative to all of the votes cast in 2020. Yes, Biden got more votes than Clinton, averaging about 23 percent more votes across the four states. But Trump added an average of 16 percent more votes.A lawsuit seeking to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania asserts the probability of Biden winning in each state is ""less than one in a quadrillion"" given the lead Trump had in each at 3 a.m.If ever a claim deserved the label of utter nonsense, this is it.What masquerades as a statistical analysis is actually a logical wasteland that ignores fundamental facts that make all the difference.The votes still uncounted when Trump had his short-lived lead were largely absentee ballots from major cities. Those cities have consistently voted Democratic historically, and mail-in votes within them should be expected to lean even more that direction since Trump had attacked that method of voting leading up to the election while Biden encouraged it.We rate this Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Amanda Chase makes bogus claim of voting fraud in Virginia precinct,"State Sen. Amanda Chase, who calls herself ""Donald Trump in heels,"" recently failed to prove her claim that Virginia’s fall elections were rigged.We asked Chase to reconcile the statistics with her overvote claim, and she said she might have gotten things wrong. ""Maybe it didn’t happen,"" she said. ""It was a memory I had in the back of my mind.""She added, ""I wouldn’t put any credence in what I was saying."" Records show the Southside precinct has voted overwhelmingly Democratic in each of 27 contested elections it has seen since its start. Chase lost the precinct by 3-to-1 ratios in her 2015 and 2019 state Senate races.Our rulingChase, trying to prove there’s voting fraud in Virginia, says Chesterfield’s Southside precinct is infamous for logging more votes than there are voters. Election records show the strongly-Democratic precinct has never had a voter turnout greater than 70% in its 12-year history. Presented with statistics, Chase says of her overvote claim ""maybe it didn’t happen,"" and ""I wouldn’t put any credence in what I was saying.""Chase’s voting fraud claim is fatuous and inflammatory.

PANTS-FIRE,"Recount finds Trump did not win Wisconsin, despite his victory claim","The pair are competing against Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively, to keep their seats in the Jan. 5 runoff that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.Loeffler and Perdue, however, were not the primary focus of the president’s speech. Instead, Trump turned to a broken-record of wrong and baseless claims, arguing there had been massive fraud and he had actually won the election, defeating Democrat Joe Biden. He and his lawyers have been aggressively pulling every lever, from recounts to lawsuits to public pressure, to undo the results of the election.Naturally, Trump turned to Wisconsin, one of the state’s that narrowly swung to Biden.""A poll came out ... Washington Post, ABC, just before the election,"" Trump told the crowd. ""(It said) I’m going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points. I said ‘No, I’m going to win Wisconsin.’ Actually, Trump didn’t. He lost Wisconsin. Let’s dig in.On Nov. 4, 2020, the morning after Election Day, the Associated Press declared Biden the winner in Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported unofficial results showed Biden with a lead of about 20,000 votes -- and that the Trump campaign was already vowing to request a recount.When it did request the recount, Trump’s team focused only on heavily Democratic Dane and Milwaukee counties. But, by the time the recount was over, Trump actually fell further behind.Having failed, the Trump campaign turned to the court system.In any case, for our purposes here, the main thing that matters is the results themselves.In a statement, Evers said: ""Today I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election, and as required by state and federal law, I've signed the Certificate of Ascertainment for the slate of electors for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris."" That sets in motion the Electoral College vote Dec. 14, which will involve 10 Democratic electors.It also means Biden -- not Trump -- won.At a Georgia rally, President Trump said ""Actually, I won Wisconsin."" There is a preponderance of evidence, including Election Day tallies and a partial recount, illustrating exactly the opposite -- that challenger Biden is the winner in Wisconsin.  Meanwhile, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump won Wisconsin. The claim, on its face, is ridiculous.Therefore, we rate it Pants on Fire.  "
PANTS-FIRE,Map showing Trump winning election with 410 electoral votes is bogus,"One feature of 2020 election misinformation that fact-checkers are hip to: faulty electoral maps that claim to show the supposedly ""real"" outcomes of the presidential election.""This is the actual results of the election,"" text above the map reads. ""People in Germany saw this before Dominion servers were seized. This will probably get removed so share as much as possible. The fraud is massive. Shame on these people.""This is wrong. The map does not reflect the real election results, as the post claims, and there’s no evidence any servers were seized. The map was aired by One America News Network, known as OAN or OANN, a pro-Trump cable network based in the U.S., and there is no evidence it surfaced in Germany.The map is sourced solely to a defeated congressional candidate Manga Anantatmula, and does not reflect state-certified election results. Among its wild inaccuracies: it awards all of California’s 55 electoral votes to Trump. California has been won by Democrats in every presidential race since 1992, including 2020.The company has delivered election modernization projects for U.S. elections since 2008, but none involve tallying votes, according to its website. The services include online initiatives like election worker training, electronic ballot delivery and real-time, visual representation of votes. In a statement rejecting the claims, Scytl said that its technologies for the U.S. are hosted and managed domestically by a Tampa-based subsidiary, SOE Software, and that it does not provide any voting machines in the U.S. or online voting services for U.S. elections.""Election-related servers WERE NOT recently seized in Europe by the US Army contrary to #disinfo rapidly spreading across social media,"" Krebs wrote.Scytl and Dominion share no ties, according to statements from both companies.A Facebook post shares an electoral map that shows Trump beating Biden with 410 electoral votes, and says that people in Germany saw these real results before ""Dominion’s servers were seized.""The map is not legitimate and was aired by a U.S. pro-Trump cable network.

PANTS-FIRE,Affidavit in Michigan lawsuit seeking to overturn election makes wildly inaccurate claims about vote,"When asked about the error in Ramsland’s affidavit, Gregory Rohl, the attorney representing the plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit in Michigan, said he and his team would investigate the data. ""I’m always willing to learn and surely want the facts set forth to be accurate in any filing bearing my name,"" Rohl wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. A chart included in Ramsland’s affidavit lists 21 Michigan cities and townships, five of which are alleged to have recorded a turnout above 90% in November’s election, while 10 purportedly saw turnout of exactly 100% and six surpassed 100%.The actual turnout statistics reveal the inaccuracy of Ramsland’s numbers. His figure for North Muskegon is off by a factor of 10: The actual number is 78.11%, not 781.91%. For Zeeland Charter Township, he inflated the turnout nearly sixfold. For Grout Township and the City of Muskegon, his number is more than triple the correct number. The 215.21% turnout rate Ramsland listed for Grout Township initially matched the data in the county’s statement of votes cast, but that’s because there was an error in the report. Gladwin County Clerk Laura Brandon-Maveal explained that the election results certified by the county are accurate, but that the number of registered voters used to compute the turnout rate was incorrect. ""We have to hand punch in the total number of registered voters and they put in the wrong number of registered voters,"" Brandon-Maveal said. The county released a corrected report Dec. 3.The Secretary of State's office never shared township, city or precinct turnout data on its results page, according to Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for the office.An affidavit filed in a lawsuit in Michigan seeking to overturn the election purports to show turnout rates in Michigan that indicate election fraud.The numbers do not match the official statement of votes cast in all but one jurisdiction, and many inflate the numbers significantly.

""Oh my god — is he taking it to that laptop?""The narrators then continue to chuckle and speculate about the man’s actions, but without any evidence that he is doing anything wrong.Gwinnett County spokesperson Joe Sorenson told us that the video shows ""a Dominion technician producing a data report on the server and saving the report to a Dominion USB thumb drive and then using a laptop to filter requested information.

PANTS-FIRE,Former Pfizer employee wrong that coronavirus pandemic is ‘effectively over’ in UK,"The posts suggest that Yeadon’s connection to Pfizer makes his views on the pandemic and vaccines credible. The coronavirus pandemic is far from over in the U.K. and in other countries, as case spikes in recent months have shown. A widespread vaccine could prevent future waves, experts said.PolitiFact’s efforts to contact Yeadon were unsuccessful. ""If Dr. Yeadon’s claim were true that the pandemic is effectively over, then the number of cases in various countries should be leveling off or dropping,"" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. Indeed, confirmed cases in the U.K. were already ""on the upswing"" in mid-October, said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist in medicine at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine. They have increased substantially in the roughly six weeks since, Bruce said.Many other countries have experienced similar trends as colder weather has sent more people indoors. The U.S. reported over 1 million new cases in the first 10 days of November. Yeadon’s claim about vaccines is also wrong. ""There is definitely still a need for vaccines,"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. ""The immune system tends to be very specific, so exposure to related viruses does not necessarily result in protection from all of those related viruses,"" Watanabe added.What we know about current case trends and the number of people who have been infected suggests that ""vaccination would be required to prevent future waves,"" Nichols said. Even if herd immunity were reached without widespread vaccination, she said, anyone who has not been infected would remain susceptible to the virus unless they got a vaccine. In a blog post that has sparked several widespread social media posts, Yeadon claimed the pandemic is ""effectively over"" in the U.K. and ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines.""Both points are inaccurate and at odds with the realities of the pandemic, which has upended lives and killed over 1.4 million people globally. Confirmed daily case counts were rising in the U.K. at the time of Yeadon’s claim and remain in the tens of thousands. People are still dying.Experts said that COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to mount in the absence of widespread mitigation measures until a vaccine is distributed.We rate Yeadon’s claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Fact-checking Rand Paul’s unsupported claim about fraud in the presidential election,"Republican Sen. Rand Paul suggested on Twitter that something suspicious — ""statistical anomaly?"" Fraud?"" — happened in four states that President Donald Trump lost to his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.State election officials have defended their electoral process and rejected claims about voter or election fraud.We dug into the evidence Paul cited, and also looked at how states count and report votes. Paul said there was something ""interesting"" about the results reporting that suggested fraud; we found it easily explained by known vote-counting procedures. Paul’s tweet misstated an element of the analysis he promoted. His tweet said there were four ""data dumps"" in four states (he did not name the states). However, the analysis centered on four updates in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. (Two of the updates were in Michigan.)The post and Paul overlook the fact that in Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, absentee or mail-in ballots received by the time polls closed on Nov. 3 were legally allowed to be counted. The fact that workers were still counting ballots past midnight on Election Day is not indicative of fraud. States’ specific rules and varying election procedures influenced the timing of results.Several municipalities in Wisconsin could not finish processing their absentee ballots by the time the polls closed at 8 p.m. on Election Day, so there was a delay in reporting those results to county clerks.The report Paul shared ""shows no awareness of the political geography of the states being analyzed,"" said Barry C. Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.""It is hardly surprising that large urban areas would take longer to count ballots and those ballots would favor Biden,"" Burden said. ""Instead, the report treats the arrival of ballots in the early morning after the election as a mystery with no clear basis in the politics of the states being investigated.""Biden encouraged Americans to vote by mail. Trump disparaged the practice, baselessly saying it caused widespread voter fraud.""Election officials and media outlets repeatedly explained how collections of tabulated absentee ballots would be released later than other ballots in some states and would tend to favor Biden rather than Trump,"" Burden said.The post Paul shared said that the vote updates were colloquially known as ""dumps"" or ""batches."" But election experts said that the term ""dumps"" is not a common technical description of these large-volume updates, although some media outlets have used that word, along with the less loaded term ""batches.""""I doubt election administrators refer to the process of counting and posting running tallies as ‘dumps,’"" said Lorraine Minnite, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University-Camden in New Jersey.Experts also raised concerns about the unnamed author of the post Paul shared.""A credible analyst would proudly attach their name to such an analysis and would contextualize the results with background on the political geography of each state rather than treating the large batches of votes as untethered from the rest of the election administration system,"" Burden said.PolitiFact asked Paul’s press office for the author’s identity but did not get an answer. His office sent PolitiFact a statement, attributed to Paul, which did not fully address our query.The statement said: ""Asking people to think for themselves, and asking that our elections be verified free of fraud, would seem to be basic, easy concepts. They are apparently too much for the media and big tech to handle, though, so they have to attack and censor.""It’s not censorship, though, to ask for proof. ""The suspicion of fraud, whether genuine or not, is not the same thing as evidence consistent with fraud,"" said Vincent L. Hutchings, a political science professor at the University of Michigan.""If one wants to raise this claim, and thereby potentially invalidate the votes of millions of Americans, then the bar should be considerably higher than mere suspicion,"" Hutchings said.Paul tweeted, ""Trump margin of ‘defeat’ in 4 states occurred in 4 data dumps between 1:34-6:31 AM. Statistical anomaly? Fraud?""His suggestion that ""data dumps"" could reflect fraud in the presidential election is not supported by evidence.First, officials who oversee elections have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud. Second, states that reported votes after Election Day did so legally and as expected. Because of a high number of absentee ballots and the time it takes to process them, election officials warned before Election Day that complete, unofficial results from all jurisdictions would not be available on Election Night.There is no credible basis to Paul’s claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Dane County 'fake votes' claim is ridiculous, based on lack of elections knowledge","Much of the misinformation circulating widely amid the hard-fought 2020 election boils down to people unfamiliar with election processes making assumptions — trumpeting something as fraud when the issue is actually that they don’t understand the process.We saw a classic example of this in the latest baseless Gateway Pundit story about Wisconsin vote counting.Here’s why this is both wrong and ridiculous.The closest thing to proof presented in the story is a sentence saying the signature (actually referring to initials) MLW was used on the ""fake votes.""It then shows a picture of a ballot with those initials.In other words, those repeated initials are exactly what and where you would expect to find repeated initials on thousands of ballots.Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell confirmed in an email the initials are simply those of the Madison clerk.Of course, Hoft didn’t pass along this information to readers until he was challenged on the matter, and after the story had collected thousands of social media shares and comments.Aside from bungling the location — Madison is a city in Dane County — Hoft’s temporary change pointed out the obvious reason for the repeated initials, while still asserting there is something underhanded about the ballots. Which there isn’t.Hoft did not offer any other proof of his amended claim in the story or an email exchange.A story shared widely across social media said, ""More than 2,000 fake votes were found at the Wisconsin Recount in Dane County on Friday!""An amended version instead referenced them as being ""suspect"" votes.Neither claim has any basis in reality.The repeated initials aren’t those of the voter, they’re initials of the clerk who issued the absentee ballots. That’s not sketchy, it’s just a basic element of how elections are administered.We rate this Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Trump's Pants on Fire claim about votes exceeding voters in swing states,"In a late-night tweet, President Donald Trump highlighted an election statistic that he thought ought to raise eyebrows.In certain swing states, there were more votes than people who voted, and in big numbers. Does that not really matter? Stopping Poll Watchers, voting for unsuspecting people, fake ballots and so much more. Such egregious conduct. We will win!There is no reading of this claim that makes it accurate.Trump didn’t specify which states he had in mind — and our request for details from the White House and the Trump campaign went unanswered. So we focused on the states where Trump’s lawyers have most aggressively challenged results: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.In each of those, there are far more registered voters than votes cast. In Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the difference is more than 2 million people in each state. At 387,612, Wisconsin has the narrowest gap, but that doesn’t include same-day registrations, so the exact number will change.In any event, the number of registered voters greatly exceeds the number of votes counted.Trump’s tweet could also be interpreted as him saying large numbers of people voted twice — once by mail, and once in person. But there is no evidence of that happening ""in big numbers"" either.""States have databases that record the receipt of a ballot from a voter and mark that voter as having voted,"" said Philip Stark, University of California-Berkeley election security researcher. ""If you vote by mail and your ballot was received, you would not be permitted to cast a vote in person at the polls; you would be marked as having voted already.""There have been instances when voters show up to vote in person before their mailed ballot arrives. The same voter database process works that direction, too. The voter’s appearance at the polling station is recorded and if a mailed ballot appears, it is saved, but not counted.Trump said that in key swing states, there were more votes than people voting, ""in big numbers.""There is zero proof. If he meant there were more votes cast than registered voters, election data show the opposite. In the six key states we examined, there were between several hundred thousand and 2 million more registered voters than votes cast.If he meant that there was a lot of double voting, his lawyers have provided no evidence to back that up. States use careful systems to prevent that from taking place.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

What’s the main difference between you?"" Huckabee asked.""Well, it’s very simple,"" Perdue replied. ""He’s a socialist."" Much of the evidence Perdue cites about Ossoff’s policy positions is inaccurate. And even if what he cited were correct, it doesn’t amount to Ossoff being a socialist. Ossoff has not stated support for such government control. Perdue’s campaign said Ossoff’s ""socialist agenda"" includes support for defunding the police, ""government-controlled health care,"" the Green New Deal and ""no borders.""Perdue’s campaign also said Ossoff supports sanctuary cities, higher taxes and changing the makeup of the Senate to ""favor Democrats.""None of those positions is socialism.""It’s somewhat difficult to classify Ossoff ideologically, as he has never held elective office and has a relatively brief history in the public spotlight,"" said Zachary Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. ""With that caveat in mind, his campaign statements and debate performances are consistent with a middle-of-the-road Democrat.""Jeffrey Lazarus, a political science professor at Georgia State University, also described Ossoff as mainstream.""Forget for a moment the massive levels of misunderstanding that pervade discourse around the word socialism. Looking just at Ossoff’s policy positions, they’re pretty mainstream Democratic policy positions,"" Lazarus said. ""As far as I can tell, Ossoff isn’t calling for any policy that is particularly left-wing.""Perdue said Ossoff is a socialist. As evidence, Purdue said Ossoff supports policies that Ossoff actually does not support, such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Those policies don’t constitute socialism.

PANTS-FIRE,Giuliani cites affidavit with crucial errors in press conference,"During a Nov. 19 press conference, Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer representing President Donald Trump, charged that many precincts in Michigan — a key state won by his Democratic opponent, President-elect Joe Biden — recorded more votes than actual voters. In Michigan, he said, ""we have over-votes in numerous precincts of 150%, 200% and 300%."" ""There were at least 19 precincts where the Presidential Votes Cast compared to the Estimated Voters based on Reported Statistics exceeded 100%,"" the affidavit reads. The document then goes on to list the 19 precincts, shown in this screenshot:A separate part of the affidavit focuses on Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. Of 47 Wayne County precincts, the document lists 25 that allegedly showed 100% turnout. Here’s that portion of the document:This portion of the document isn’t accurate either: None of the 25 precincts listed are actually in Wayne County. Like the 19 precincts cited above, each is located in Minnesota. Voters wait to cast their votes on Nov. 3, 2020, at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. (AP)When we checked data from the office of the Minnesota secretary of state, we found no support for the affidavit’s conclusions. In the five townships cited as having the largest number of over-votes, the number of votes on election day was smaller than the number of registered voters. For example, the affidavit cites Minnesota’s Benville Township as having 350% voter turnout, which would be by far the largest over-voting rate alleged in the document. Both Giuliani and Trump lawyer Sidney Powell cited the 350% figure in the Nov. 19 press conference. However, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s election data, 63 people voted in the township, and 71 were registered to vote, a turnout rate of 89%. Risikat Adesaogun, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Secretary of State’s office, told PolitiFact that ""we have canvassed at the county level, and we don’t have any clarity about the contents of the affidavit and the source of the alleged data.""It’s unclear what data Ramsland used to arrive at his percentages. We reached out to him but haven’t heard back. L. Lin Wood, another Trump campaign lawyer, has filed the affidavit as part of a lawsuit in Georgia. When reached by email, Wood called the labeling of the numbers as being from Michigan rather than Minnesota a ""simple mistake"" and said the document ""will be corrected if it hasn’t been already.""""We are imperfect,"" he told PolitiFact.Giuliani said that in Michigan, ""we have over-votes in numerous precincts of 150%, 200% and 300%.""The numbers come from an affidavit filed by lawyers working for Trump, but the jurisdictions cited are in Minnesota, not Michigan.

This is unbelievable!""Sigh.This jump is actually very believable — and was entirely expected.But since Trump has raised the issue yet again, with a slightly different chart, let’s review why this claim is absurd.That 3:30 a.m. change simply shows the time when the City of Milwaukee reported its absentee ballot results.This wasn’t surprising because:We knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later.And that’s exactly what happened.From 3:26 to 3:44 a.m. in The Associated Press election reporting stream, the vote for Biden jumped by 149,520 (9.2% of Biden's total votes) and Trump's vote jumped by 31,803 votes (2% of his total votes). Milwaukee County accounted for nearly all of that jump.The fact that Trump was ""ahead"" before that batch was reported —  as highlighted in Trump’s tweet —  is immaterial. At that point all the votes hadn’t been counted yet.It would be like trying to end a football game when your favorite team is ahead after the third quarter.So Trump’s number may be roughly right. But his explanation of what it means is completely wrong.Trump said Nov. 18 that Wisconsin received a ""dump"" of Biden votes, asserting this is ""unbelievable"" and evidence of fraud.But it’s just evidence of someone who doesn’t understand the vote counting process in Wisconsin.That jump in Biden votes is when Milwaukee reported its 170,000 absentee ballots all at once. We knew long before the election this group would be reported late together and would weigh heavily in Biden’s favor. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Trump says Philly Democrats stole an election in the '90s. Is that true?,"As part of his relentless campaign against the results of the 2020 presidential election, President Donald Trump on Nov. 13 invoked an old case of voter fraud perpetrated by Philadelphia Democrats that altered the result of a state Senate election. So what happened in 1993? Pennsylvania held a special election to replace a Democratic state senator from North Philadelphia who died in office. Most of the voters in the area he represented were registered Democrats, but turnout in previous elections had been low, and the balance of power in the state Senate was on the line. Whichever party won the special election was poised to capture a majority in the upper house. To ensure that Democrat William Stinson would win, three Philadelphia election officials illegally delivered hundreds of absentee ballot packets to Stinson’s campaign. Staffers then distributed the packets to voters who didn’t qualify at the time to vote absentee, instructed them in some cases to vote for Stinson, and delivered the ballots to the Board of Elections.The case wound up in federal court after state election officials and state courts rejected Republicans’ claims about impropriety.  ""Stinson knew of and ratified the procedures, and the board participated in and later tried to conceal its involvement in the scheme,"" U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer said at the time. In February 1994, Newcomer took the unprecedented step of invalidating all 1,757 absentee ballots cast in the election. Back then, voters were allowed to request absentee ballots only if they were too sick to vote in person or planned to be out of the city on election day. Newcomer heard testimony from dozens of voters who said the Stinson campaign led them to believe the law had changed and they were now allowed to vote from home just for convenience. In dozens of other cases, the campaign simply forged the signature of voters. In the end, Newcomer ordered that Stinson, a then 49-year-old former assistant deputy mayor of Philadelphia, be removed from office and that Republican Bruce Marks, a then 36-year-old lawyer and former aide to U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, replace him. ""This is extraordinary relief,"" Newcomer wrote in February 1994. ""However, it is appropriate because extraordinary conduct by the Stinson campaign and the board tainted the entirety of the absentee ballots.""The following month, The Philadelphia Inquirer published an exhaustive examination of the absentee ballots cast in the Stinson-Marks contest and revealed that 540 absentee ballots, nearly a third of the total, were tainted by some form of improper conduct, including voters’ signatures being forged, ballots cast in the names of dead or out-of-district voters, and campaign workers marking ballots themselves. The race was close enough to turn the loss into a win for the Democrats.The 2020 presidential election and this 1993 state Senate special election differ in several key ways. Campaigns are still barred from distributing absentee ballots to voters, but Pennsylvania now allows residents to vote by mail without giving a reason — the very conduct that was barred during the 1993 special election. And critically, unlike the Marks campaign, which sought relief for specific allegations of voter fraud, the Trump campaign has not alleged in court that any mail ballots were intentionally cast illegally. Rather, the campaign has been seeking to disqualify ballots submitted by lawful voters based on claims about counting procedures and other rules. Trump tweeted that a 1993 example of voter fraud in Philadelphia is ""exactly what happened to us"" in the 2020 election. It is not, and there is no evidence the Trump campaign is making that argument in court. The 1993 case at the heart of Trump’s tweet involved a rare, verified case of voter fraud. The Trump campaign has not alleged a specific case of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, and there is no evidence of any. Trump’s statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire. "

""It’s a whole other game to claim that vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Making that claim requires evidence.""As evidence for his claim that the statement was ""highly inaccurate,"" Trump said in his tweet that ""dead people"" voted in the election, Republican poll watchers were barred from polling locations, ""glitches"" in voting machines changed votes from Trump to Biden, voters were allowed to vote late, ""and many more."" We have fact-checked all of these claims and found them lacking evidence.Trump tweeted that ""the recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud.""A multitude of evidence supports the statement released by Krebs’ former agency that the election was not rigged.Trump’s claim is not grounded in evidence.

They don’t affect DNA at all. This is the first time this type of vaccine has reached this point in the process of readying vaccines for general use, Lynas said, and because these vaccines involve injecting genetic material in human cell as opposed to traditional vaccines, which involve injecting an inactivated or weakened virus directly into the body, they could be easier to adjust as this coronavirus mutates.As for whether these vaccines can affect someone’s spirituality, or control the behaviors of people who get them, ""that’s in the realm of science fiction,"" Lynas said. We rate this Instagram post Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump’s jab at Georgia recount ignores key voting principles,"In his effort to challenge votes in states he lost, President Donald Trump focused on the hand recount of over 5 million ballots in Georgia.""The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified,"" a fundraising email from Trump said. ""Georgia’s secretary of state won’t let the people checking the ballots see the signatures for fraud. Why? Without this, the whole process is very unfair and close to meaningless.""Trump has cast doubt on the validity of mail-in ballots for months. In Georgia, he is asserting that not only should the count of votes be checked, but the authenticity of each mail-in ballot, too.This overlooks a core principle of American democracy: How you voted is your business, and no one else’s. For voting in person, the voting booth guarantees your privacy. For mail-in ballots, the process is different. Each mail-in ballot comes in a sleeve or envelope that the voter must sign. Election workers then match the signature to their voter records.""They review the signature, and if it complies with the law, the ballot is separated from the envelope to maintain secrecy,"" said David Becker, head of the private Center for Election Innovation and Research. ""There is no way to go back and review signatures after they’ve been separated from the ballots, and there’d be no reason to do so.""Every state follows the same basic steps, Becker said. Once the ballot is verified, it becomes an anonymous vote just like a vote cast in person.Signature verification is critical for ensuring that only valid ballots are counted, and Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, explained that his office doubled down on the steps to maximize accuracy.""The Trump campaign and its allies knew the rules of the election well in advance of the election, and those rules had been set by a legislature and a governor friendly to the campaign, and were enforced by a secretary of state of the president’s own party,"" Becker said. ""It’s only after they lost the election that they’ve raised any concerns, and they still have found no evidence of any issues with the ballots.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Trump said Georgia’s secretary of state won’t allow people recounting ballots to check the signatures for fraud.This reflects a flawed understanding of how mail-in votes work. Before a mailed ballot is counted, the voter’s signature has already been verified. In Georgia, it is verified twice.To protect the privacy of the vote, after verification, every state separates the ballot from the signed envelope it came in. By design, there is no way to reunite the two pieces of paper.A recount can only be a recount of ballots, and Trump and his campaign knew that months ago.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"No, there was nothing shady about the “lost” Milwaukee elections flash drive","In an election season where President Donald Trump and his supporters are glomming onto any irregularity in hopes of justifying their voter fraud claims, the tale of one Milwaukee flash drive has drawn significant attention.That has brought a lot of attention to the counting and reporting of those Milwaukee votes.""Developing: Milwaukee Elections Chief Lost Elections Flash Drive in Morning Hours of November 4th When Democrats Miraculously Found 120,000 Votes for Joe Biden.""But the core of the claim is that the head of the Milwaukee Election Commission lost a flash drive, which they say is shady and imply proves voter fraud.Neither element is remotely true.Let’s review how we got here.In pushing back against claims of voter fraud, election officials in Wisconsin and across the country have noted that human error happens. But it happens in observed, controlled environments in a system that is packed with redundancies and doublechecks to ensure those errors are caught and corrected.One such error occurred in Milwaukee.This story was then picked up by The Gateway Pundit, which added in references to previously debunked voter claims and piling on additional assertions that Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, was filmed ""feeding totals into a machine in the wee hours of the morning WITHOUT any election observers"" and ""purposely broke all protocol by transferring numbers to a flash drive.""These specific claims are 100% wrong, as is the underlying claim that anything in this circumstance is consistent with fraud.About 3 a.m. Nov. 4, Woodall-Vogg and other city election officials finished counting 170,000 absentee ballots and prepared to bring them to the Milwaukee County Election Commission. That meant putting a flash drive in each of the 12 tabulating machines — used to count ballots — to download the tallies.These tabulators are not able to connect to the internet to transmit totals directly, so flash drives have been used to transfer the data from the city’s central count location to the county commission since these machines went into service in 2015.Woodall-Vogg gathered the flash drives and went to the commission office — about a mile away — with a police escort, only to discover that she had left the flash drive for Tabulator 7 in the machine. She then called a member of her leadership team, who found the drive in the machine and gave it to a Milwaukee police officer to deliver. About 15 minutes passed from the time Woodall-Vogg realized the drive was missing to when it was delivered.Officials confirmed no changes were made to the drive, since the time stamp on the drive and tabulator confirm the downloaded file hadn’t been altered. And the flash drive’s detailed vote tallies matched those on the machine.In any case, there’s no reasonable way the drive could have been altered in that span, Woodall-Vogg said.""The machine is not able to be accessed from a distance, so it seems completely unfeasible to think that someone would alter a flash drive’s results, which had between 12k-15k votes on it, but still maintain the vote counts by ward to be accurate,"" she said in an email. ""Staff were in the room (with the drive) the entire time, the live stream was still streaming, and the flash drive remained in the machine the entire time.""Woodall-Vogg also noted the two claims added by Gateway Pundit’s account are baseless. She wasn’t ""feeding totals into a machine,"" she was simply downloading results from the machine that ballots had been fed into throughout the day. And she didn’t break any protocol by transferring the numbers to the drive, she was following standard procedure since flash drives are required to get totals off the tabulator.Milwaukee uses DS450 and DS850 model tabulators, which don't have modems that allow direct connections to the Internet, Woodall-Vogg said in an email.And the fundamental claim that the drive is connected to the wee hours shift to Biden is ridiculous. That jump was both expected and legitimate, as it’s simply when officials finished counting Milwaukee’s absentee ballots.  And we should note Republican lawmakers are the reason the absentee votes were reported so late. They refused to act on a request from a bipartisan group of local clerks that they be allowed to begin processing absentee ballots before Election Day. Milwaukee was one of 39 communities that set up a central count location, which is why the totals were reported together once the counting was complete.A website claims a lost flash drive in Milwaukee is connected to ""When Democrats Miraculously Found 120,000 Votes for Joe Biden.""The word ""flash drive"" is about the only truth in this claim. It’s a stretch to call it lost since it was under the supervision of election officials when it was unintentionally left behind.And it’s absurd to connect this flash drive to a jump in Biden votes. Those votes were from absentee ballots that were long expected to strongly favor Biden. We know the drive in question wasn’t altered since the timestamp on the data copied to it matched the original transfer, and the vote totals on it matched those recorded by the machine.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

For example, the WIC nutrition program serves as a key mechanism for connecting low-income pregnant women with nutrition supports and clinical services, and immunization screenings and vaccine promotion are built into the WIC program. Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision.""The report’s lead authors, Monica Schoch-Spana, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security; and Emily K. Brunson, an associate professor of anthropology at Texas State University, told PolitiFact that the Distributed News article contains factual inaccuracies and misleading statements. ""We support voluntary vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available.

""We also take exception to the singling out and professional misrepresentation of Dr. Luciana Borio, an accomplished infectious disease physician who has expertise in medical countermeasures, including vaccines.""Schoch-Spana and Brunson wrote that the group supports efforts to make the vaccines readily available to everyone who wants one, including individuals with limited means.""We support the provision of vaccinations alongside other services and goods that can help reduce the myriad burdens that the pandemic has placed upon individuals such as lost jobs, interrupted income, food insecurity, evictions, and foreclosures. We do NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual’s vaccination status.""Social media posts cite an article as evidence that Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, recommended in a July report that the government withhold ""food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.""This is wildly inaccurate and contrary to the report’s actual recommendations.

It is one of 65 counties in Michigan that use the company’s equipment.In Georgia, early morning voting halted temporarily in Morgan and Spalding counties when individual Dominion machines malfunctioned. The issue there had to do with a breakdown between the digital list of voters provided by one company, and the voting machines provided by Dominion. Technicians resolved the problem, and a judge allowed the affected polls to stay open until 11 p.m. to make up for lost time.Georgia uses the same system statewide, and the glitch took place only in these two counties. There is no report that votes were miscounted. Trump easily carried both places, winning by a 40-point margin in Morgan County and by 20 points in Spalding.There is no credible evidence that any voting system was used to switch or delete votes, as online posts, President Trump and some right-wing media organizations are claiming. The report Trump cited in his tweet aired Nov. 12 on One America News Network, a pro-Trump television network. The network cited an ""unaudited analysis of data obtained by Edison Research."" We reached out to OANN for a copy of that analysis but haven’t heard back. The company said it has not found data that back up OANN’s report or Trump’s tweet.""Edison Research has produced no such report and we have no evidence of any voter fraud,"" said Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research.Election technology experts called the claims baseless, and said the numbers (like Trump’s 2.7 million ""deleted"" votes) are almost impossible to prove without a digital forensic investigation and a nationwide audit. Edward Perez, election-technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonprofit that studies voting infrastructure, said these claims show a misunderstanding of how election administration works.The process involves numerous protocols that include rigorous system tests that take place publicly, and before the technology is used in elections, Perez said.""In the U.S., the way that elections are actually run, technology does not exist in a vacuum. It’s only one of multiple critical things that would make it exceedingly difficult for mass fraud to happen at this level undetected,"" he said.Nearly all election jurisdictions engage in testing of their systems and ballots before every election. In order for an election jurisdiction to flip votes fraudulently, bad actors would need to figure out how to simulate the appearance of that public testing.And in many places, the test doesn’t only occur on the front end. A similar process is done, again, before officials start tabulating ballots.Without any credible evidence that the voting system is resulting in mass tabulation errors, Perez said, the posts and stories appear to border on outright disinformation.""The claims have reached a scale that is so wild and outlandish that it is perfectly reasonable for people to wonder if the intent of such messages is to specifically inflame passions and to confuse people and undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of the election.""Viral social media posts claim that the 2020 presidential election is compromised because Dominion Voting Systems flipped votes to favor Joe Biden.This is wrong. There is no credible evidence that the system affected any vote counts. Minor problems, including human error and temporary machine malfunctions, took place in a few jurisdictions and did not impact vote tabulations.We rate this Pants on Fire!"

""Importantly, there has been no proof of illegal votes in the election, and no pathway to go from complaints about inadequate access to overturning the results of the election.""The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Trump’s focus in Pennsylvania has been on Philadelphia, where a Nov. 5 judge’s order allowed election observers from both parties to view the ballot-counting process from 6 feet away.Philadelphia appealed the order, arguing that the original arrangement let all observers ""see the entire set up"" in detail.

PANTS-FIRE,"Matt Schlapp’s baseless claim that 9,000 Nevada mail ballots are illegitimate","As supporters of President Donald Trump ramp up their efforts to delegitimize the election with unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud, one high-profile Republican ally claimed that 9,000 Nevada ballots were fraudulently cast by nonresidents.The campaign’s list showed ZIP codes for voters’ current and previous addresses, but it left out other personally identifying information. The lawyers said they formed it by cross-referencing the list of general election voters in Nevada with publicly available change-of-address records.A county election worker scans mail-in ballots at a tabulating area as an observer watches at the Clark County Election Department on Nov. 5, 2020, in Las Vegas. (AP)How did Schlapp get from the campaign’s list of 3,062 out-of-state voters to 9,000? His number relies on back-of-the-envelope math and some major assumptions, including the assumption that everyone who mailed in a ballot was ineligible to do so. There are no signs of a new, bigger list that includes 9,000 changes of address or voter names.An American Conservative Union spokesperson said Schlapp had projected that the number of people who illegally voted from outside Nevada was actually three times as large as the 3,062 people originally alleged. The spokesperson said that’s because only one-third of people report changes of address to the national database maintained by the U.S. Postal Service.But Martha Johnson, a spokesperson for the Postal Service, said the service was ""unable to confirm"" that only one-third of people report when they change their address. ""The USPS processed approximately 36 million change of addresses"" in 2020, Johnson said.Schlapp claimed that as an example of voter fraud, ""we have literally 9,000 people who voted in this election (in Nevada) who don’t live in Nevada.""Schlapp has acknowledged that his 9,000 figure is not a literal count of illegal out-of-state voters. It is a speculative estimate he came up with based on a list of 3,062 individuals produced by the Trump campaign — a list that had its own problems. The original list included military personnel in its count and did not establish that any of the people it identified were actually ineligible to vote in Nevada.

PANTS-FIRE,Debunking the ‘Hammer and Scorecard’ election fraud conspiracy theory,"Some fans of President Donald Trump are sharing the theory that a package of CIA computer programs have hacked the 2020 election. One program, called Hammer, cracks into protected networks, while another, called Scorecard, changes vote totals.With that, let’s look at the CNN evidence that Geller takes to be telling.A large graphic shows Beshear with a total of 674,508, while a smaller running total at the bottom of the screen gives him 673,948. According to the man giving the commentary, the total at the bottom of the screen runs behind the more current one on the larger graphic. In that light, a difference of 560 votes makes sense. The one on the bottom has yet to catch up.But at the same moment, Bevin’s totals show 661,675 on the large graphic, while the one at the bottom shows 662,235. That’s 560 votes less than the most up-to-date one on the big graphic. In the view of Geller and the man speaking on the video, the fraud is obvious.""You have just seen 25% of the loss amount of this race happen in front of your very eyes,"" the man giving the commentary said.Is this proof of shenanigans?Two election security experts we reached were unimpressed.""The broader issue here is that the election night results are not official,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III. ""There’s a post-election canvas period when results are checked and mistakes spotted and corrected.""Stewart said there’s a key flaw in the theory that the purported software package of Hammer and Scorecard could intercept the digital transmission of vote results and change them. He said the states that do send data that way also keep the data tapes of votes from the original machines.""The results only become official after the election department has compared the paper tapes  — which are immune to supposed hack — to the initially transferred results,"" Stewart said.The CNN election night results are ""the sports aspect of elections, not the binding results,"" said statistics professor at the University of California-Berkeley Philip Stark.Stark cautioned that no election system comes with 100% ironclad protection against hacking.""Nothing is perfect, and they are all vulnerable,"" Stark said. He advocates for greater use of paper ballots and careful post-election audits.But that said, Stark sees no evidence that any results have been altered in this election or past ones. Regarding the CNN inconsistencies, he noted that CNN contracted for the data feed from a third party vendor. That puts CNN’s number even further removed from the official tally.Stark said nothing in the CNN example holds up.""That’s not how anyone would hack an election,"" Stark said. ""If you really wanted to change the total, you would not change it on election night, where everyone could see it. You would change it in the voting tabulation system.""And for those who think Hammer and Scorecard were deployed in the 2020 election, Stark said that raises the question of why skeptics look only at the presidential race.""If the motivation was to put the Democrats in power, why didn’t they flip the Senate?""  Stark  posed. ""Biden will have a hard time without the Senate. Why would you leave the job half done?""We asked Geller to respond to the issues raised above. She didn’t address the specific matters but said that she sees ample evidence of fraud, including ""eyewitness accounts of tens of thousands of ballots coming in the back door (that) should give even you pause, despite your baked-in far-left bias.""Geller said that a 2019 CNN video clip shows the work of purported CIA-built hacking software Hammer and Scorecard in action. The clip shows a momentary glitch in election night totals.The head of the government agency created by Trump to protect against cyber attacks called the Hammer and Scorecard theory, ""nonsense.""Election security experts said election night totals are distinct from official results, and post-Election Day vetting by state officials catches discrepancies between local results and totals calculated at the central office. They also noted that if someone truly wanted to steal an election, the example Geller cited makes no practical sense.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, Rock County did not have a glitch that stole votes from Trump","The latest baseless Wisconsin voter fraud claim centers on Rock County, where Eric Trump and other conservatives claim to have uncovered votes that switched from President Donald Trump to President-Elect Joe Biden.This claim is baseless. Rock County votes were accurately recorded. Here’s what actually happened.Gateway Pundit’s article claims they ""identified approximately 10,000 votes that were moved from President Trump to Biden in just one Wisconsin County.""They present as evidence two screenshots from Fox News’ election results showing President Trump listed with 46,649 votes at 11:43 p.m. on Nov. 3, compared to 37,133 for Biden. Those numbers then switched in a screenshot with a time of 11:57 p.m.But this projection only makes sense if Trump rightfully received those votes. And he didn’t.The article does not include any discussion of why those votes flipped, or interviews with election officials. Here’s what Gateway Pundit would have found if they had done that research.Vote totals reported by the Associated Press create the stream of data used by Fox News and many other election websites on Election Day.For Rock County, Wisconsin, that stream showed a steady increase for both President Trump and Biden from the first report around 8:30 p.m. until the last one just before midnight.When the final vote tallies were reported at 11:43 p.m. — after poll workers tabulated the absentee ballots — Biden’s total jumped from 30,453 to 46,649, while President Trump’s jumped from 31,343 to 37,133. (That difference in absentee ballots is consistent with the rest of the state and nation, as President Trump had repeatedly urged his supporters not to use mail-in votes, while Biden and Democrats had encouraged absentee balloting.)However, the Associated Press sent an update at 11:45 p.m. that transposed the numbers, wrongly assigning the 37,133 total to Biden and the 46,649 total to President Trump. That was corrected minutes later to correctly show President Trump losing by 9,516 votes.That data is entered by the AP based on the clerk’s website, without involvement from election officials.""There was a brief technical error in AP’s collection of the vote count in Rock County, Wisconsin, that was quickly corrected,"" Patrick Maks, AP spokesman, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""AP has myriad checks and redundancies in place to ensure the integrity of the vote count reporting. We are confident in what we have delivered to customers.""In other words, the ""glitch"" was in a media system, not a voting system. The wrong numbers were briefly loaded into an array of media websites, but the numbers were never counted or reported incorrectly by Rock County.""Everybody’s human, but maybe you should check your source instead of jumping to conclusions,"" Tollefson said of the voter fraud claim.Eric Trump claimed on Twitter that a glitch uncovered in Rock County removes Biden’s lead in Wisconsin.But there was no glitch in the election system. And there’s no ""gotcha"" moment or evidence that will move votes over to President Trump’s column.The presidential totals were transposed for several minutes due to a data entry error by the Associated Press, without any involvement by election officials. The votes were counted following standard procedures by the Rock County Clerk’s Office and show Biden winning the county by a margin of more than 9,000 votes.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump’s Pants on Fire claim about illegal votes,"As vote counting continued, President Donald Trump offered a fresh round of falsehoods and wrongly suggested illegal votes are swinging the election toward Joe Biden. As Trump continues to perpetuate a myth about widespread voter fraud, he hasn’t proved that illegal votes influenced the election. ""So far we have seen no credible evidence of illegal votes in any state that could potentially tip the results of the election to Trump,"" UC Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said Nov. 6. ""Assuming Biden wins Pennsylvania, I see no path for Trump to litigate his way to victory based upon unsubstantiated claims of fraud."" The idea that Democrats would orchestrate a nationwide felonious scheme to count illegal votes would require voters and election workers in various counties (Democrats and Republicans) to coordinate and take actions that risk prison time. And it defies logic that such a scheme would take place that would aim to keep Trump out of the White House but have Republicans win seats in the House and potentially retain control of the Senate.Republicans govern some of the states Trump has challenged vote counting. Nevada has a Republican secretary of state. Georgia has a Republican secretary of state and governor. Arizona has a Republican governor.The regular counting of legal ballots continued at the time of Trump’s remarks in a handful of battleground states.Election officials have been following the processes in their state laws to verify and tabulate ballots. They have been rejecting ballots that violated state laws, such as omitting the signature on the envelope or sending it in past the state’s deadline, and only counting ballots that are legal, said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. Many states give voters time to correct signature issues.Steven Huefner, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said questionable ballots are set aside and not counted as they await an official review.""Might an election official make a mistake and count a ballot that should not have been counted? Sure. Is there any evidence that has happened this election? Not that I have seen,"" Huefner said.Whether any of those 3,000 or so voters were indeed ineligible to cast a vote remains to be seen. However there are circumstances under which a person who has moved can still cast a Nevada ballot, including if they left the state temporarily, are in the military or are students.Regardless, 3,000 votes (and assuming all such votes went to Biden) would not make up the difference for Trump as of Friday afternoon, when Biden led in Nevada by about 20,000 votes.Nevada expanded voting by mail due to the pandemic, which Gloria said resulted in a slower process to complete the count. But he explained that election officials are taking the steps required to verify ballots.""Time and time again when rubber hits the road there is no evidence, no evidence in academic after academic study, in court case after court case — there was whole presidential commission election integrity to track down widespread voter fraud — none of those cases found widespread voter fraud,"" Hovland said.It’s possible when all the vote counting is finished that election officials will find some cases of fraudulent votes cast, but there is no evidence of widespread fraud. ""The reality is voter fraud in this country is limited,"" Hovland said. ""It is isolated cases, usually small races where a few votes make a difference.""Trump said, ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.""At the time of Trump’s comments the process of counting legal ballots continued in a handful of states with close races. Election experts say that local election officials are proceeding by following their state laws to count and verify ballots.There is no evidence that proper counting of legal votes automatically means Trump wins.

McCarthy’s offices in California and Washington, D.C., did not return calls from PolitiFact seeking comment or clarification on what he said on national television or if he had heard from Iowa elections officials.""The key thing here is transparency, so you can see what happened,"" Pate said. The vote count is still going on, and the audit Pate ordered was to begin immediately and be done by Tuesday afternoon, when Jasper County canvasses its votes, he said.McCarthy said that 300 voters in Iowa were allowed to re-vote to change an election outcome. That is wrong. Pate and Parrott laid out in their news conference how the state first reported votes in Miller-Meeks’ favor swung to being in Hart’s favor. No one was allowed to re-vote, Pate’s office said.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Austin is not one of the most dangerous cities in Texas, let alone in the U.S.","Texas’ top political leaders gathered in Houston Oct. 28 at a ""Back the Blue"" news conference to express support for police officers and lambaste cities that cut police budgets.Gov. Greg Abbott sat alongside Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, R-Lake Jackson, and U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to reiterate plans for a state takeover of police functions in Austin after the City Council voted in August to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shift another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments.Abbott and other Republican leaders have criticized the council’s move repeatedly, but Patrick turned up the volume in remarks he gave during the Houston event.""The city of Austin is a disaster if you haven’t been there. A great city, now one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas,"" Patrick said.""If we don’t back the police, we’re not going to have any police and you’re going to be left on your own,"" he said. ""And if you think that’s hyperbole, it’s not.""We were curious about Patrick’s claim that Austin is now one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. and Texas. Let’s compare how Austin crime measures up against other major metropolitan areas.We don’t know exactly what Patrick means by the term ""dangerous"" — his office did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls for explanation. A city could be considered dangerous, for instance, by its vulnerability to floods, wildfires or other natural disasters that threaten a population’s security. But considering the context in which Patrick’s comments were made, a ""Back the Blue"" pledge event, it’s safe to assume that Patrick was referring to crime.We also don’t know what information Patrick based his claim on. However, criminologists took Patrick’s use of ""dangerous"" to specifically mean violent crime, or crimes that threaten a person’s physical safety. This category, defined by Austin police as crimes against persons, includes violations such as murder, kidnapping and assault.When ranking Austin’s violent crime rates to that of other large U.S. cities, Austin comes nowhere near the top of the list.Austin police reported 3,953 incidents of violent crime in 2019, a rate of about 400 incidents for every 100,000 residents, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. Among the nation’s 30 largest cities that report crime numbers to the FBI database, Detroit topped the list with about 1,965 violent incidents per 100,000 residents, followed by Memphis, Tenn., Baltimore and Milwaukee.Austin’s violent crime rate of 400 incidents per 100,000 residents ranked 28th among the 30 largest U.S. cities, above El Paso and San Diego. Austin ranked near the bottom of that list in 2018 and 2017 as well.Patrick’s second claim, that Austin is ""definitely"" one of the most dangerous cities in Texas, is also not borne out by last year’s crime data.The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program shows that, among 534 Texas cities reporting data, Austin ranks 128th. The cities with the highest violent crime rates are South Padre Island, New Boston, Snyder and Oyster Creek, each with a rate above 1,200 incidents per 100,000 residents.If you look at only the largest 25 cities in Texas — cities with populations the size of Round Rock, 132,747, or larger — Austin ranked 13th. Houston, Lubbock, Dallas, Corpus Christi and Amarillo, in that order, are the cities with the highest violent crime rates in Texas.The FBI has not released any crime numbers for 2020, but the Austin police chief’s latest monthly report shows that, while certain categories of violent crimes are up, violent crime on the whole is about even with where it was this time last year. Murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, intimidation and incest are up so far, while rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault, simple assault and others are down.Patrick’s claim is the latest attack from Republican leaders on the Austin City Council’s budget decision.In August, a week after the council approved the budget, Abbott held a news conference pledging to push legislation next year that would freeze property tax revenue for any city or county that cuts law enforcement spending.

""They were pulled out directly from the rest of the mail and delivered the same day.""We contacted the election supervisor offices of two of the largest South Florida counties, Broward and Miami-Dade.

PANTS-FIRE,Milwaukee wards did not have more votes for president than registered voters,"Many political eyes are on Wisconsin after Democratic nominee Joe Biden narrowly won the state, which was the first one to flip parties in a contentious presidential race that’s still too close to call. The increased attention has led to a surge in misinformation about the state’s election process. Bottom line: It’s wrong. Very wrong.The sourceBefore we get into the claim itself, here’s a refresher on City Wire. Now, onto the latest claim.There are a few problems here. The first: The numbers were completely incorrect.Whether you look at total ballots cast in each ward or just those cast for Biden and Trump, the amount does not exceed the total number of registered voters. (Quick note: Votes for Biden and Trump don’t add up to total ballots cast because there were other candidates for president, and some people may not have voted in that race.)Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel it wasn’t clear where the numbers in the article came from. She said the reporting software from the city and county reflect different numbers than what City Wire published.For instance, the article said Ward 274 cast 1,290 votes for Biden and Trump when the number was actually only 593. City Wire also cited the Wisconsin Secretary of State’s office as the source of the data. But, unlike in some other states, that office in Wisconsin is not involved in the state’s elections and therefore doesn’t collect election data. ""My office coworkers who first saw that and called it to my attention and I have no idea what they’re talking about because we have no such records,"" said Secretary of State Doug La Follette, whose small office focuses on authenticating official documents with the state seal.On a broader scale, the Wisconsin Elections Commission has emphasized that it’s simply not possible for there to be more ballots than registered voters. Wisconsin allows people to register at the polls on Election Day. A widely-shared online article said ""seven Milwaukee wards report more 2020 presidential votes than registered voters.""The numbers cited by Milwaukee City Wire do not match data from the Milwaukee County clerk’s office, which show the number of registered voters exceeded ballots cast. Moreover, it’s simply not possible for there to be more ballots than voters.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Wisconsin voter turnout did not jump from 67% in 2016 to 89% in 2020","The long wait for presidential election results has created a void where citizens are seeking information on how we got here — a void being filled often with poorly researched information.Donald Trump Jr. was among the many on social media the day after the election reacting to voting numbers without first considering or researching whether they’re legitimate.It fed into the false narrative swirling among conservatives that Wisconsin and other key states went to Democratic candidate Joe Biden as a result of voter fraud.The turnout claim — retweeted based on Trump Jr.’s share more than 13,000 times — is absurd and based on a misunderstanding of basic election math. Twitter has since suppressed the original tweet, noting it ""might be misleading about an election."" It is misleading.Wisconsin had more than 3.6 million registered voters heading into Election Day, and more than 3.2 million Wisconsinites voted in the presidential race.But those aren’t the numbers used to calculate turnout here.Even more important, registered voters is the wrong figure entirely for calculating turnout. Voter turnout in a same-day registration state is based on the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot.That’s the highest rate ever behind the 2004 election, but solidly in the range of past presidential contests here.Recent presidential election turnouts in Wisconsin:2020 — 72.3%2016 — 67.3%2012 — 70.4%2008 — 69.2%2004 — 72.9%2000 — 67%So, a good chunk of the increased turnout was due to his supporters.Trump Jr. shared a claim that Wisconsin’s turnout jumped from 67% in 2016 to 89% in 2020, and intimated it is due to fraud or something nefarious.But it’s due to bad math.Turnout is measured as a percentage of eligible voters, not registered voters.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Wisconsin did not take a break from counting election results","Misinformation about Wisconsin is flooding social media after yet another presidential race was decided in the key battleground state by a razor-thin margin. Democratic nominee Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump by roughly 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, according to unofficial results reported by the Associated Press. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in a similarly close battle for the state four years ago, and Biden’s win will undoubtedly shape the outcome of the national race. But an influx of absentee ballots cast in Wisconsin because of the coronavirus pandemic meant results took longer than usual to come in — allowing rumors and false information to fill in the gaps. And no part of it is accurate.Election results in WisconsinElection officials worked all night and into the early morning to count more than 3.2 million ballots, said Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. That included an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots that workers could not start counting until Election Day, per state law. It’s perfectly legal, but has the practical effect of large numbers being added at the same time. Other municipalities in the state count absentee ballots at the precinct level, so they are tallied along with in-person votes. The late boost for Biden from Milwaukee was expected, especially because mail-in ballots tend to skew toward Democrats and Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold. So, two things: Biden was never up by 100,000 votes, and he will certainly not win Wisconsin by that much. It’s also ridiculous to suggest Wisconsin election officials ""took a break"" when they spent all night processing ballots. A delay in results does not mean the counting process stopped. The Facebook poster did not respond to a request for comment. A viral Facebook post cites a tweet that claimed, ""Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k.""The Democratic nominee never held that great of a lead in Wisconsin, even when the Associated Press called the race.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump falsely and prematurely claims 2020 presidential victory,"President Donald Trump prematurely, and falsely, said early Wednesday that he won re-election for president, and called for the counting of ballots in the United States to cease.""This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country,"" Trump said in remarks from the East Room of the White House. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.""He said the campaign would go to the Supreme Court, without offering specifics about a theoretical case. ""We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list, okay? It’s a very sad moment. ... And we will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it.""Ballots are routinely counted after Election Day for a number of different reasons, in states controlled by both Republicans and Democrats. Despite Trump’s remarks, the counting of legal ballots continues across the country, not just in states that remain too close to call. The increase in mail balloting isn’t the only factor preventing a full accounting of all votes shortly after the polls close. There are at least two categories of ballots that, according to state law, are certain to be counted after Election Night in any election year. The other involves provisional ballots, which are ballots cast when a voter’s eligibility is in question. If election officials resolve those questions, the ballot is counted, but the checking and counting process takes time.Trump’s path to an Electoral College victory appears to ride on winning a combination of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, five states he carried in 2016.At the time of Trump’s remarks, which began at 2:21 a.m. Eastern Time Wednesday, he led in the raw vote count in each of those five states. But not all the votes have been counted in those states, and absentee and mail-in ballots from urban areas likely to support Biden are among those yet to be counted. At the time Trump spoke, significant numbers of ballots remained to be counted in the Democratic strongholds of Pennsylvania such as Philadelphia, the Philadelphia suburbs and Pittsburgh. In Milwaukee and Detroit, a significant portion of votes remained to be counted. Trump’s lead in Georgia — like the three others, a state Trump won in 2016 — had also narrowed with Biden making gains around Atlanta. Lead switching between the candidates in any given state is not a sign of something amiss.That’s especially true this year when network number-crunchers are well aware that ballots cast by mail might have very different patterns of results than ballots cast in person. States that are rated as ""too early to call"" or ""too close to call"" by media organizations can’t be tentatively chalked up as a win for either candidate. And that’s where credible media outlets’ decision desks are currently ranking Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, as well as a few other states, including Georgia.Designating states as too close to call is done specifically to avoid giving a candidate a premature lead in the race. No mainstream media organization, including conservative-friendly Fox News, or even conservative outlets like Newsmax or OANN, had projected Trump as the electoral college winner at the time of his remarks.Trump said, ""As far as I’m concerned, we already have won"" the 2020 presidential election. At another point, he said, ""frankly, we did win this election.""It is possible that Trump will win re-election. But his White House speech in the early morning hours of Nov. 4 wasn’t a prediction. It was a premature and false declaration based on incomplete information about the vote counts in a number of states.The U.S. election system allows states more than a month to count legally cast ballots. No credible organization had reported that Trump won when he made his speech. Trump’s statement is wrong and ignores the process by which the United States casts and counts votes.

When the media ""calls"" a presidential race — which may or may not happen on Election Night — it is because they feel that projections from the current results are strong enough to announce one candidate over the other. It’s not an official result. ""There are no official results on Election Night — there never have been,"" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. ""Election Night tallies are always just preliminary, pending certification of the canvass of returns under state law, which takes time.

If election officials resolve those questions, the ballot will be counted, but the checking and counting process takes time.The rules for provisional ballots were streamlined by the Help America Vote Act, a federal law passed in 2002. ""Provisional ballots by their very nature cannot be counted on Election Day or Election Night and must be verified subsequently as part of the canvassing of returns,"" Foley said.This deadline acknowledges, as a matter of federal law, that states are not obligated to have a final official result on Election Night. As a practical matter, Weil said, ""the vast majority of ballots will be counted within two or three days of Election Day, even in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that cannot start counting absentee ballots until the day before Election Day or on Election Day itself.""The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Trump said that ""counting ballots for two weeks ... is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws.""He’s wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,Did Trump confuse the public option with Medicare for All?,"During the final presidential debate, President Donald Trump claimed that 180 million people would lose their private health insurance to socialized medicine if Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request asking where the evidence for this claim. Experts called it a distortion of Biden’s plan.Experts agreed the number of individuals who have private health insurance either through an employer-sponsored plan or purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace is around 180 million people. Biden supports expanding the ACA through several measures, including a public option. Under his plan, this public option would be a health insurance plan run by the federal government that would be offered alongside other private health insurance plans on the insurance marketplace. Getting rid of the so-called ""employer firewall"" is also part of Biden’s proposal. This firewall was implemented during the roll out of the ACA. It was designed to maintain balance in the insurance risk pools by preventing too many healthy people who have work-based coverage from opting instead to move to a marketplace plan. And it all came down to who qualified for the subsidies that made these plans more affordable.  Currently, those who are offered a health insurance plan through their employer that meets certain minimum federal standards aren’t eligible to receive these subsidies, which come in the form of tax credits. But that leaves many low income workers with health care plans that aren’t as affordable or comprehensive as marketplace plans. Biden’s plan would eliminate that ""firewall,"" meaning that anyone could choose to either get health insurance through their employer or through the marketplace. That’s where many Republicans argue that we could start to see leakage from private health insurance plans to the public option. Blumberg, though, said that because the marketplace would still include private health insurance plans alongside the public option, it doesn’t mean everyone who chooses to leave their employer plan would go straight to the public option. Either way, none of the estimates are anywhere close to the 180 million that Trump claimed. Overall, experts said no, what Biden supports isn’t socialized medicine. However, Antos said in his view that the definition of socialism can really vary when it comes to health care. ""I would argue in one sense, we would already have socialized medicine. We have massive federal subsidies for everybody, so in that sense, we’re already there,"" said Antos. ""But, if socialized medicine means the government is going to dictate how doctors practice or how health care is delivered, we are obviously not in that situation. I don’t think the Biden plan would lead you that way."" And in the end, Antos said invoking socialism is a scare tactic that politicians have been doing for years. ""It’s just a political slur,"" said Antos. ""It’s meant to inflame the emotions of those who will vote for Trump and meant to annoy the people who will vote for Biden."" Trump said 180 million people would lose their private health insurance plans to socialized medicine under Biden. While about 180 million people do have private health insurance, there is no evidence that all of them would lose their private plans if Biden were elected president. Biden supports implementing a public option on the health insurance marketplace. It would exist alongside private health insurance plans, and Americans would have the option to buy either the private plan or the public plan. While estimates show that there are a number of Americans that would likely leave their employer-sponsored coverage for the public plan, they would be doing that by choice and the estimates are nowhere near Trump’s 180 million figure. Experts also agree that the public option is not socialized medicine, and it’s ridiculous to conflate Biden’s plan with Medicare for All. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

We took a closer look.Trump’s retweet gave airtime to a new conspiracy theory about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, the death of Osama bin Laden and a 2011 helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Its source is the unsubstantiated claims of a falconer.The article shared in the post that Trump retweeted was published by a conservative political website called DJHJ Media.

They were killed by insurgents during an assault on a Taliban compound.""The most egregious media reportage transcended the merely ignorant and pushed into maliciousness,"" he wrote.

PANTS-FIRE,Mike Pence said Joe Biden copied Trump’s pandemic response plan. Pants on Fire!,"During last week’s vice presidential debate, moderator Susan Page, USA Today’s Washington bureau chief, asked Vice President Mike Pence about the U.S. COVID-19 death toll. Pence replied by touting the Trump administration’s actions to combat the pandemic, such as restrictions on travel from China, steps to expand testing and efforts to accelerate the production of a vaccine.""And, quite frankly, when I look at their plan,"" he added, ""it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about.""Because COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States, with nearly 8 million cases and upward of 215,000 deaths, we decided to examine both the Trump and Biden plans to curb the pandemic and investigate whether Pence was on target in his charge that the Biden plan is rooted in Trump’s ideas.At first glance, there are obvious similarities. Both declare goals like vaccine development and expanding public availability of COVID-19 tests.But public health experts also pointed to significant philosophical differences in how the plans are put into action.As Pence pointed out, the Trump administration has focused its efforts to combat COVID-19 along a couple of lines.Importantly, the administration also shifted significant decision-making responsibility to states, leaving the development of testing plans, procurement of personal protective equipment and decrees on stay-at-home orders and mask mandates to the discretion of the governor or local governments. Despite that, Trump still urged states to reopen beginning in May, though in many areas cases of COVID-19 remained high.Biden’s plan would set out strong national standards for testing, contact tracing and social distancing — words that echo the Trump plan. It proposes working with states on mask mandates, establishing a ""supply commander"" in charge of shoring up PPE, aggressively using the Defense Production Act and accelerating vaccine development.Biden has said he would follow scientific advice if indicators pointed to a need to dial up social distancing guidelines in light of another wave of COVID-19 cases.Even Pence pointed out this philosophical difference during the debate, saying that Democrats want to exert government control while Trump and Republicans left health choices up to individual Americans.Vreeman and others pointed to another contrast — that the Trump administration has yet to issue a comprehensive COVID-19 response plan.Wen is right that the Trump administration has not issued a detailed plan, such as Biden’s document. The Trump administration has, however, offered a road map for how vaccines would be distributed.Another major distinction emerged in the way the candidates have communicated the threat of the coronavirus to the public and reacted to public health guidelines, such as those issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Throughout the pandemic, Trump has downplayed the threat of COVID-19, touted unproven treatments for the disease such as bleach, hydroxychloroquine or UV light, questioned the effectiveness of face masks and criticized or contradicted public health officials’ statements about the pandemic.The two candidates’ approaches to listening to scientists is also different.""Biden has said he is going to look at science and value the best scientists,"" said Benjamin. ""The Trump administration has not walked the talk; they have said one thing and done something else. If you go on the Trump administration website, you see guidelines that they didn’t follow themselves.""In the end, the Biden campaign has the distinction of being able to learn from the Trump administration’s early missteps, said the experts.There’s also a reality check: if Biden wins and attempts to implement his COVID-19 plan, it’s important to consider that no matter how well thought out it looks on paper, he may not be able to accomplish everything.Pence claimed the Biden plan to address COVID-19 was similar to the Trump administration’s plan ""every step of the way.""A cursory, side-by-side look at the Trump administration’s COVID-19 actions — no actual comprehensive plan has been released — and the Biden plan indicates some big picture overlap on securing a vaccine and ramping up testing. But that’s where the similarities end.Biden’s plan includes proposed actions the Trump administration has not pursued. It also is focused on federal rather than state authority, a significant distinction Pence himself pointed out during the debate.Additionally, the candidates’ behaviors toward COVID-19 and views on science have been diametrically opposed, with Trump eschewing the use of face masks and social distancing, and Biden closely adhering to both.Pence’s statement ignores critical facts and realities, making it inaccurate and ridiculous.

This means that people who wear masks, are actually ‘collecting’ the virus in their masks. The airborne particles are being absorbed into the Masks and staying on our faces rather than dissipating. A clear indication there is a correlation to more infected people wearing masks than those who do not.""Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman evaluated the post and the CDC report from which it’s purportedly sourced for PolitiFact. ""There’s nothing in this (report) that indicates that mask wearing is associated with more coronavirus,"" he said. ""Honestly, I don’t even know how that could be possible.""Instead, the paper summarizes findings from a survey of 314 people. 154 of these people had tested positive for the coronavirus. The other 160 participants (the study’s control group) had tested negative for the coronavirus.From the results of the survey, the CDC report found that two activities were linked to a positive COVID-19 test: close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as bars and restaurants.The correlation between frequenting on-site eating locations and a positive COVID-19 test probably indicates that masks play a role in preventing the spread of the virus. The paper notes that masks ""cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking,"" so diners and bar-goers are likely exposed to infectious respiratory droplets when they lower their masks to take a drink or a bite of food. The table featured in the Facebook post doesn’t show that mask use is correlated with the spread of the coronavirus. In fact, it shows the opposite: more people who tested negative for the coronavirus reported that they ""always"" wore masks than people who tested positive. Of the 160 survey participants who tested negative, 74.2% reported that they ""always"" wore a face mask or cloth face covering. Of the 154 participants who tested positive, 70.6% reported that they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering. Neuman took issue with the survey asking participants to self-report their rates of mask use.""Conducting science by survey has problems,"" he said. ""There are certain things that are embarrassing or politically and socially sensitive, and you generally won’t get honest answers if you just ask them on a questionnaire because (participants) don’t know if they can trust the person on the other end, don’t know if they’ll be repercussions, or may just be embarrassed about telling the truth.""The CDC did not respond to our request for comment by deadline.The Facebook post’s claim that masks are ""collecting"" infectious airborne particles mischaracterizes the science behind masks and how they stop viral spread. Respiratory droplets with the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze, or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles, which are extremely difficult to remove. However, if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles. Neuman shared three studies of hundreds of thousands of infected people that all found that mask-wearing reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Unlike the CDC report, these studies didn’t rely on survey data and self-reported rates of mask use. A Facebook post says that a CDC report found that ""people who wear masks, are actually ‘collecting’ the virus in their masks.""The CDC report cited in the post actually found the opposite: More people who tested negative for COVID-19 reported wearing masks than people who tested positive. Other scientific studies have consistently found that mask wearing decreases the spread of coronavirus. We rate this post Pants on Fire! ​"

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Wisconsin votes don’t have to be counted by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3","As President Donald Trump continues to demand an early call of a winner on election night, a new Facebook post making the rounds suggests he got his wish -- at least in Wisconsin.In the comments on the post, many offer thanks for sharing the information. Some call for the same order to be given for other states.One problem: The post is completely fictitious.In fact, a ruling from a federal judge -- upheld by an appeals panel -- actually does the opposite. It extends the period for which absentee ballots can be counted by nearly a week.Let's look at this more closely.The first problem is that results have never been tallied by 8 p.m. on Election Day.That’s when polls close.Even in pre-pandemic election years, when many fewer absentee ballots are involved, it can take hours to run all of the ballots through machines and get final numbers. That’s because Wisconsin is among a few states that do not allow election clerks to begin that process until Election Day.The Facebook post says a judge issued this ruling but provides no name.That’s because there is no such ruling.Historically, state law has held that only absentee ballots received by Election Day can be tabulated. Those that come in later, even if mailed on time, are discarded.On Sept. 21, 2020, a federal judge ordered a number of changes to procedures. Notably, for our purposes here, he gave Wisconsin voters more time to get their absentee ballots in. As long as the ballots are postmarked by Nov. 3, they can be accepted and counted by clerks through Nov. 9, nearly one week later.That judge, William Conley, initially put that ruling on hold, so it could be appealed. On Sept 29, a panel of appeals court judges upheld the ruling, putting the extended deadline in place.That ruling, which was unanimous, came from a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.The decision was a victory for Democrats, who asked to loosen election rules during the coronavirus pandemic and a setback for Republicans who tried to prevent changes to the timeline of Election Day. The ruling, which could be appealed again, also gave voters extra time to register to vote, extending the deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21. The Facebook post claims that a judge ruled all ballots in Wisconsin must be counted by 8 p.m. on Election Day.But the post gets it completely wrong. First, voters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote. No judge made this ruling. An earlier ruling from a federal judge -- since upheld by an appeals panel -- actually did the opposite, allowing any absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Analysis bashing DHS COVID-19 calculations is built on errors, omissions","Predictably, that spurred a related jump in the percentage of COVID-19 tests yielding positive results in the state.The rise has prompted renewed scrutiny of the state’s COVID-19 response. Some claim this is proof Gov. Tony Evers’ mask mandate isn’t working, while others say it means we aren’t taking the threat — or the mask mandate — seriously enough.The MacIver story went on to make a series of claims building on that thesis:""A fundamental flaw in how the Evers’ Administration calculates Wisconsin’s daily COVID-19 positive test rate has excluded hundreds of thousands of test results and led to a wildly distorted picture of the state’s progress in confronting the virus,"" said the story’s first paragraph.It later quoted Ryan Westergaard, DHS chief medical officer, as explaining the positivity rate is calculated by dividing the number of positive cases by the number of people tested — not the total number of tests.The MacIver piece calls this a ""shocking admission."" What’s more, it’s an acceptable way — even the preferred way, by some — to do the calculation, since it weeds out multiple tests of the same person.Here’s why this ""bad math"" claim is ridiculous.The most obvious error in this claim is blaming math for the ""exploding positive test rate.""The seven-day average of tests with positive results — a more reliable marker than daily totals since it smooths out daily jumps caused by changes in testing volume — rose slowly through August, from about 6% to 8%. It then spiked starting in September, pushing the seven-day average close to 20% by the end of the month.The MacIver piece posits this is due to errant calculations. But this rate has been calculated the same way throughout this entire stretch.So whatever one’s objections to the methodology, if the same formula is used at the beginning and the end of a given time period, and the rate increases dramatically in that span, the increase is real.Test positivity is, indeed, one of the criteria. But the MacIver implication that it lacks legitimacy falls flat. The criteria doesn’t call for a specific percentage level to be met. Rather it calls for a downward trajectory for 14 days. And, as we noted, the same measuring stick — the formula — has been used throughout.That brings us to the heart of this claim, that DHS is using ""bad math"" in calculating the percentage of positive tests. The MacIver piece itself elaborates on this, asserting, ""If the goal is to calculate the daily positive test rate, then DHS is using the wrong numerator and denominator.""DHS calculates percent positivity by dividing the number of people with positive test results by the number of people tested in a given span. (Their dashboard includes daily counts as well as a seven-day and 14-day average.)The MacIver piece asserts this is incorrect, saying the state should instead be basing the calculation off the raw number of tests, which would deliver a lower percentage.But the state’s approach is actually both widely used and preferred because it prevents people who are tested often from skewing the data. These aren’t people who feel sick or exhibit symptoms and seek a test — the typical sort of person tested. Rather, these are people who are tested regularly based on their position (such as a front-line health care worker) or situation (such as living in a nursing home where an outbreak has occurred).Counting each of those negative test results would give an unrealistic picture of how frequently positive tests are occurring in the population — the core question all testing is trying to answer.Johns Hopkins University, which operates a COVID dashboard has become a go-to national resource in the pandemic, endorses this approach. Officials there said some places aren’t using it only because their data doesn’t allow them to break it down this way.The CDC calculates positivity by dividing the number of positive tests by the total number of tests taken. It notes it only uses this approach because it doesn’t have access to the data state and local health departments have to identify  — and separate out  — repeat tests from the same individual.Some states divide the number of people with positive tests by the total number of tests taken.Some states use Wisconsin’s approach, dividing the number of people with positive tests by the number of people tested.None of this national context was included in the MacIver piece.DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said Sept. 29, 2020, the agency was in the process of launching an updated dashboard that shows test positivity calculated using both approaches — number of people and number of tests. She said both measures ""are informative to the response effort in Wisconsin."" One more quick note for some general context on this metric.""The choice of who gets tested is based on state- or county-specific criteria, but is often made based on how sick people appear to be, which in turn influences test positivity,"" the blog post said. ""If a state only tests people who have clear symptoms of the virus, it will likely have a higher test positivity than one that is also testing asymptomatic people.""A MacIver article widely shared on Facebook says ""bad math"" is to blame for Wisconsin’s ""exploding positive test rate.""This is wrong on multiple fronts.They’re asserting manipulated math is behind the increase in test positivity, but it’s actually because the number of people testing positive has risen based on human behavior. There is no ""bad math."" The state DHS uses a methodology (tallying people tested rather than raw tests) that is widely used by health agencies around the country. It is considered a more accurate approach because it assures people who are tested on a regular, even daily, basis — such as health care workers — don’t skew the data.And whatever the quibbles with the methodology, this wouldn’t cause the increase in the test positivity rate because the formula DHS used to calculate the rate was the same throughout the time period.That makes this claim both false and ridiculous, or as we call it, Pants on Fire.Note: DHS updated their COVID-19 dashboard Sept. 30, the day after this story published, to include test positivity in terms of both tests and people. That does not affect the rating for this item since the per-person method remains on the DHS website and remains an acceptable and even preferred approach. "

But here are several AP images that clearly show the spine right-side up.In the following images, perhaps the most iconic ones taken of the event, it is a little harder to read the spine, but the free end of the ribbon bookmark clearly dangles below the Bible, which is how it was when the Bible was oriented correctly in the other images.The Biden campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Biden said that after Trump walked across Lafayette Square to a church, he held a Bible upside down.This false claim spread on social media earlier this summer, without evidence, and made it into several news reports and opinion pieces.  But fact-checkers debunked it as early as June, and a review of still images and video from that day show clearly that it is inaccurate.

""I think there was tremendous cheating in California, there was tremendous cheating in New York and other places."" In New York, Clinton won 4.56 million votes, while Trump won 2.82 million votes. We were curious about his claim of ""tremendous cheating in New York"" in the last presidential election. We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign to get details of what Trump was talking about, but we did not receive a response. Though we can’t know for sure, New York has had some voting irregularities that Trump could have had in mind when he said that. ""There was nothing of note in the 2016 election to indicate there was any election tampering or cheating or whatever you want to call it,"" said Sarah Goff, deputy director of Common Cause New York, an organization that closely watches elections and was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city elections board in the 2016 primary. There were documented problems with eligible voters being improperly purged from the New York City Board of Elections’ voting lists during the 2016 primary. But in the interview, Trump talked about how he won the popular vote ""in a true sense,"" and made claims about ""tremendous cheating"" in New York and California. The popular vote he is talking about refers to the general election, not the primary. There is no evidence of cheating in the 2016 general election. Trump made a ridiculous claim. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. "

Trump banned most non-Americans arriving from Europe.

I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""Two days after that, he spoke to Woodward about why he downplayed the virus earlier and why he wanted to continue to downplay it.McEnany said Trump never downplayed the virus. The record shows she’s wrong. During the early months of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump said the country was in very good shape and blamed Democrats and the media for trying to inflame the situation beyond what the facts would warrant. In the very tape that McEnany was asked about, Trump said he downplayed the virus to avoid creating panic.

When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, ‘We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,’ and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. ‘What the f--- are we doing that for?

Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender. This is unbelievable California!""With so many claims swirling, we decided to check the facts. The Facts About SB 145Current state allows a judge to decide whether to place a young man convicted of statutory rape, in which vaginal intercourse takes place with a minor, on the sex offender registry based on the facts of the case. There is no such discretion when the offense includes anal or oral sex. SB 145 would eliminate automatic sex-offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor. Instead, a judge would make the decision, as with cases involving vaginal intercourse. The law would not apply in cases where a one party does not believe the sexual contact was voluntary.LGBTQ advocates, including the bill’s author state Sen. Scott Wiener (D–San Francisco), say it would do away with a discriminatory law, one that’s a relic of a penal code that criminalized those acts until 1975, even between consenting adults. ""This distinction in the law is irrational and discriminatory towards LGBTQ youth,"" Wiener said in a fact sheet on the law produced by his office, Equality California and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, all of which support the bill. ""SB 145 ends this irrational distinction by treating all sex the same way that the law currently treats penile-vaginal intercourse.""Kamlager said the disparity in the law was ""put in place during a more conservative time in California and historically these [police raids] were done systematically to target folks to remove people who identified as being LGBT from our society.""Sex With A Minor Remains Illegal, In All Cases, Under SB 145Some of the claims on social media say the bill protects rapists or lessens penalties for statutory rape. That’s not the case. Also, the bill does not apply to any sex offenders convicted of forcible rape. The legislation is supported by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault and by law enforcement groups such as the California Police Chiefs Association and the California District Attorney’s Association.Claim About A 21-Year-Old Having Sex With An 11-Year-OldThe second part of the Facebook post that we fact-checked claims, ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender."" That’s also wrong. SB 145 only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range. ""The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close,"" the bill’s fact sheet estimates. ""At the end of the day, a judge will have full discretion to place someone on the registry, and a prosecutor can seek it.""Our RatingA widely-shared Facebook post claimed California had legalized ""pedophilia,"" and that ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender."" That post and many like it are simply wrong. They grossly distort the proposals in state SB 145, which aims to eliminate a disparity in how LGBTQ young people are treated on California’s sex offender registry. The legislation would eliminate automatic sex offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. Instead, a judge would make that decision, just as existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders in cases involving vaginal intercourse on the registry.The bill would not, in any fashion, make it legal for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor. The only change involves giving a judge discretion over whether to list an offender on the sex registry for certain sex acts. We rate the claims in the Facebook post Pants on Fire. "

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Trump doesn't deserve credit for Kenosha de-escalation","The images emerging from Kenosha were jarring after Jacob Blake was shot in the back seven times by a police officer and two protesters were shot and killed — all in the span of two days.Buildings in flames.People armed with baseball bats destroying property and looting.Armed vigilante groups roaming the streets with long guns.Police patrolling in armored vehicles and riot gear.But the atmosphere took a distinct turn for the better in the days after the Aug. 25, 2020, shooting that left 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse facing multiple homicide charges.And President Donald Trump says you can thank him for that.But this claim is particularly jaw-dropping. His sweeping assertion assumes at least three things to be true.Kenosha was on a trajectory for destruction.No other changes happened that would have improved the Kenosha situation.He alone is responsible for activating the National Guard.Each of these is wrong. Let’s break it down.This is the most obvious hyperbole in Trump’s tweet. (It's also a claim he repeated even more strongly the next day, saying during a Sept. 1 roundtable with Kenosha leaders, ""I come into an area like this and I see the town is burned down."")The events in Kenosha have been tragic and shocking. But there’s a big difference between protests damaging a limited area and destroying or altering a large portion of a city of 100,000 people.The protests, even at the peak of the unrest Aug. 25, were largely concentrated in the 1-acre Civic Park and a nearby area a few blocks wide. Though people spilled into nearby neighborhoods after the largest groups were dispersed.That drastically exaggerates the scope of the situation in Kenosha, a city of 28.4 square miles, even at its worst.Trump’s attempt to claim credit assumes the National Guard presence was the only factor in the lack of violence after the Rittenhouse shooting. There are many reasons that’s wrong.The simple makeup of the crowd changed.That page was removed by Facebook after the Rittenhouse shooting, and the presence of people wearing military gear and openly carrying weapons dropped drastically after the night of chaos that included the shooting, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters who have been on the ground in Kenosha — though citizens with handguns were observed as late as the weekend.During the height of the protests, the vigilante groups and Black Lives Matter protesters were regularly clashing with each other, by hurling insults or worse. Removing half of that equation — for whatever reason that occurred — changed the situation dramatically.There have also been calls for peace from all corners, including Blake’s family, at marches and rallies, and — to varying degrees — from Gov. Tony Evers and local officials. In addition, Evers has declared a state of emergency, and local officials have taken steps such as closing off freeway access to better control the area — beyond simply increasing the number of troops (which has also happened).All of which brings us to the most fundamental claim here — that Trump dispatched the National Guard.And even that isn’t true.He described it this way when asked Aug. 31 what role the White House has played in the Kenosha response.The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Sept. 1.Examples of federal missions given on the website included deployments to Kosovo or the anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East.But all National Guard members working in Kenosha have been mobilized by Evers or governors in Michigan, Arizona and Alaska as part of the inter-state agreements. They are commanded by Knapp and remain under state control.The Kenosha effort has not been federalized, said Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback.In other words, none of the National Guard troops now in Wisconsin have been dispatched or authorized by Trump. And the state-run efforts to bring troops were underway a full day before Trump first had contact with Wisconsin officials. ""The governor had already activated the Wisconsin National Guard to respond in Kenosha and doubled their presence before Trump or his Administration offered federal support,"" Cudaback said.The timeline of events in Kenosha makes this crystal clear.Here are key moments in the Kenosha unrest and the law enforcement response, as detailed by Evers’ office and media reports. Times of key events are provided where relevant.Sunday, Aug. 235:15 p.m. — Jacob Blake is shot.9:31 p.m. — Wisconsin Emergency Management authorizes neighboring agencies to assist local law enforcement.Monday, Aug. 24The National Guard provides 125 troops — the full number who are part of that team.Neighboring jurisdictions provide more than 100 law enforcement officers.Tuesday, Aug. 2511:45 p.m. — Police say Rittenhouse opens fire on protesters, killing two and injuring a third. Wisconsin began coordinating with other states about obtaining additional National Guard resources and support.The Wisconsin State Patrol provides more than 70 officers.Neighboring jurisdictions are still providing more than 100 law enforcement officers.Wednesday, Aug. 2611 a.m. — Meadows talks to Evers again, with federal authorities ultimately sending FBI and U.S. Marshal support to the area later in the day. Cudaback said as of Aug. 31 this remained the only federal government assistance provided.Neighboring jurisdictions are still providing more than 100 law enforcement officers.The Wisconsin State Patrol is now providing 80 officers.Thursday, Aug. 27The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 750 troops.Friday, Aug. 28The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 1,000 troops.Arizona, Alabama and Michigan National Guard troops arrive, accounting for at least 500 more guardsman (total of 1,500). All of these troops are under Knapp’s command.Knapp said Aug. 31 that those 1,500 National Guard troops remained deployed in Kenosha. The guard members do not make arrests, but ""fulfill roles that allows those (local) law enforcement officers to be freed up"" to more active work in the streets, he said.The next day, at a White house briefing, Trump asserted Rittenhouse was ""trying to get away"" and was ""violently attacked"" before opening fire — a description that ignores the fact Rittenhouse had already allegedly shot and killed a man prior to that point.The timeline shows this is clearly wrong. The National Guard had been in Kenosha for more than a day when the Rittenhouse shooting occured.Trump said on Twitter, ""If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now.""That’s wrong on every level.It’s a vast exaggeration to say the situation in Kenosha was so dire as to threaten its very existence. And many other factors played a role in the reduced violence in the days before Trump’s tweet.But the most fundamental element of this claim is also completely wrong. National Guard troops were en route and even on the ground well before the Trump administration got involved.The National Guard troops ultimately sent were deployed in Wisconsin by Evers and Knapp or sent from other states as part of agreements entered into by the states’ governors.We rate this claim Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Instagram Posts Make False Claim CA Voters Will Be ‘Turned Away’ From Polls Due To Mail-In Voting,"Widely-shared posts on Instagram on Monday claimed California voters would be ""turned away"" from in-person polling places on Election Day unless they change their voting preference to ""No mail-in voting."" Election experts quickly rejected that message. We examined the details in this fact check.Our researchWe found this greatly distorts what Newsom did and makes a false accusation about its consequences. Here are the facts:Nor does it require voters to do anything different to vote in-person. ""You do not need to change anything with your voter registration in order to participate in-person in this election,"" said Sam Mahood, spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees the state’s election. Mahood described the claim about being ""turned away"" at the polls as ""definitely misinformation."" He said his office reported the posts to Instagram and Facebook and noted that some had been taken down.Mahood added that the new law does not alter the voting preference Californians select when they register to vote. If their preference is listed as in-person voting, they will continue to be listed that way in future elections. California's In-Person Voting OptionsThere are several ways California voters can participate in-person. Voters can fill out their ballot at home, place it inside the envelope provided and turn it in at a polling place, their county elections office or a ballot drop box. Voters must sign the outside of the envelope for their ballot to be counted. If voters want to fill out a ballot at a polling place, election officials recommend they bring their vote-by-mail ballot with them to ""surrender"" it at the polls, which essentially means they will exchange it for a ballot at the polling location and the vote-by-mail ballot will be canceled. Voters can also fill out their mail-in ballot at a polling place and turn it in onsite, though Mahood said election officials are encouraging people to fill out those ballots in advance to cut down on crowds at the polls.She said officials are using the hashtag #TrustedInfo2020 to help voters identify reliable election information online.Meanwhile, the California Voter Foundation is urging voters ""to SIFT information before they share it."" SIFT stands for ""Stop, Investigate, Find reliable info, and Trace sources before sharing anything via social media,"" Alexander said. As for the claim at the center of this fact check, Alexander agreed it ""is absolutely false.""""We have many failsafes in our voting process to ensure no one is turned away,"" she said.Our ratingSocial media posts claimed California voters would be ""turned away"" from in-person voting unless they made a change online to their voter preference by selecting ""No mail-in voting."" That is simply not the case. Voters don’t need to make any voting preference change to cast their ballot in-person. All active registered voters will receive a mail-in ballot ahead of Election Day, as part of an effort to stay safe amid the pandemic. But there are in-person voting options and none require Californians to make any changes to their voting preferences. The claims in these social media posts are both inaccurate and reckless, deserving of our most severe designation.  We rate them Pants On Fire. Related:"

Barkan speaks through the use of a computerized device that translates his eye movements into an artificial voice. The manipulation hinged on a portion of the interview where Biden talked about police reform. Scalise’s video spliced Barkan’s words to make it seem like he asked if Biden agreed ""that we can redirect some of the funding for police."" But that was not a question that Barkan posed.

""Are you open to that kind of reform?""""Yes, I proposed that kind of reform,"" Biden said, according to the unedited audio. ""And by the way, the idea though, that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police.""As Biden continued explaining his proposals for police reform, Barkan interjected: ""But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?""""Yes. Absolutely,"" Biden said. ""And by the way, not just redirect, condition them. If they don’t eliminate chokeholds, they don’t get Byrne grants. If they don’t do the following, they don’t get any help.""Those in Barkan’s circle shared that takeaway.Scalise shared a video that said Barkan asked Biden, ""Do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police?""That’s not what Barkan asked.

For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.""King cited an older version of the NCHS report that analyzed 153,504 deaths involving COVID-19. Six percent of that figure is 9,210. To some readers, the report may appear to confirm his math. But it doesn’t.The NCHS report shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities.

It may be they had no comorbidities or they were just not noted,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

PANTS-FIRE,Michigan officials decry ‘racist’ robocall with false attacks on mail-in voting,"A robocall targeting Detroiters falsely claims that voters who apply for and use absentee ballots are providing personal information that will be used against them.None of these claims are true.""This is an unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote,"" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a news release. ""The call preys on voters’ fear and mistrust of the criminal justice system — at a moment of historic reckoning and confrontation of systemic racism and the generational trauma that results — and twists it into a fabricated threat in order to discourage people from voting.""""This is an unfortunate but perfect example of just how low people will go to undermine this election,"" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in the news release.After Nessel’s office received one complaint last week, the state set up a website for those to report receiving the call and has received approximately 20 reports so far.Authorities learned of the roughly 37-second call after someone who received it alerted radio station WWJ-AM (950). It's the only complaint received so far on this call, according to Nessel's office.The speaker on the robocall identifies herself as working for a civil rights organization founded by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, two right-wing provocateurs who are routinely accused of peddling misinformation. However, Nessel said the state is still working to confirm who recorded and orchestrated the distribution of the robocall.""This robocall is fraught with scare tactics designed to intimidate Black voters — and we are already working hard to find the bad actors behind this effort,"" said Nessel.Michigan’s voter registration application asks individuals to provide some basic personal information. Applicants must share their driver’s license or Michigan-issued state ID card number, the last four digits of their Social Security number or an alternate form of identification unless they are hand-delivering their application to their clerk’s office, disabled or eligible to vote overseas. This is required by federal law. Applicants must also share their first and last name, date of birth and address.In Michigan, any registered voter can request an absentee ballot, which requires completing a form noting basic information voters would have already shared when they registered to vote.But the robocall falsely suggests otherwise, warning Detroiters that voting absentee means ""giving your private information to the man.""The call also falsely claims that when voters submit an absentee ballot, their personal information will become part of a public database. Voter registration records are available to the public and show a voter’s name, address and birth year. All other information, including the identification number used by the voter, month and day of birth, and phone number or email address if the voter included it are not publicly available. These details can only be accessed by the Michigan Secretary of State’s office as well as local election officials and workers. This is not information police departments, credit card companies or the Centers for Disease Control can access.It's a felony under Michigan law to deter or otherwise disrupt a person trying to vote, according to Nessel's office. Someone convicted of this offense could face a $1,000 fine and up to five years in prison.More than 1.6 million people successfully cast absentee ballots in the state's Aug. 4 primary election. In Michigan, mail-in voting and absentee voting are the same thing, and the method is a secure way to participate in the electoral process, Benson and other elections experts say.This fall, more than 3 million Michigan voters — about 38% of registered voters in the state — are expected to mail in their ballots as the presidency is up for grabs and the pandemic rages on. Our ruling The robocall claims the personal information of those who vote by mail will be included in a public database that will be used by police departments to track down old warrants, credit card companies to collect debt and the CDC to administer mandatory vaccines.There is absolutely no truth to the claims. While the robocall says that the personal information of those who vote by mail will be exposed, there is no information mail-in voting makes public that isn’t already included in public voting records. Voting by mail does not require voters to share personal information beyond basic identifying information already required when voters registered with the state, and this information is used only for the purposes of administering elections.We rate the call’s claims Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Fact-checking Trump’s frequent claim that Joe Biden ‘abandoned Scranton’,"""He keeps talking about, ‘I was born in Scranton. I lived in Scranton.’ Yeah, for a few years, and then he left for another state. You know the state. But this Scranton stuff. That’s why I figured I’d come here and explain to you one thing. But I think you people know it better than I do. He left! He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton.""""I don’t know how to say no to them. For real. I really don’t,"" Biden said. ""You know, it’s still home."" He returned to Scranton at least half-a-dozen times in the 1970s after he became a U.S. senator from Delaware, Scranton Times-Tribune clips show. And when Biden entered national politics, his Scranton friends were there to support him. Kennedy chartered a bus to Wilmington with other Biden supporters from Scranton in 1988 when Biden launched his first bid for the presidency. A Times-Tribune photographer captured him holding a banner at the campaign kickoff there that read, ""Scranton, Pa. Claims Biden."" (Kennedy died last year.) ""We used to joke about it,"" Bell, 77, a semi-retired insurance agency owner, told the Tribune. ""He was always here.""   ""There’s nothing phony about him,"" Orr, 77, a retired union electrician, who was an usher at Joe and Neilia Biden’s wedding in August 1966, told the Tribune. ""As far as our friendships, as far as Scranton, he’s not just saying that, he’s not just giving you lip service."" ""For President Trump to suggest that Joe Biden has anything other than deep Scranton roots is just ridiculous,"" said Conaboy, 62, who is president of a regional health care system in Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania. ""We’re honored to know him and honored to consider him a friend.""There’s another, less literal way to assess whether Biden ""abandoned"" Scranton. Did the trade policies he supported harm the city’s workers? Did Biden let other countries ""steal our jobs,"" as Trump claimed in Old Forge? The answer to that question is more nuanced — and central to the economic debate between the two candidates. But economic policy is complex and multifaceted. Scranton’s manufacturing sector was already in decline before NAFTA, losing 6,000 jobs between 1990 and 1994, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And Petsas noted that Scranton’s education and health sectors exploded over that same period, with 14,000 new jobs added.""We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs while gaining in other areas,"" Petsas said. ""That result doesn’t mean it’s bad trade policy.""Trump claimed Biden ""abandoned Scranton."" Biden’s family moved from Scranton to Wilmington when he was 10, but he has remained deeply connected to his birthplace for more than six decades. He has returned for commencement speeches and little league games. He’s come back for fundraisers and after floods. He went home to eulogize his childhood best friend and to comfort a mentor’s family as the man lay dying. And while one sector, which was already on the decline, struggled in the wake of policies Biden supported, a leading local economist notes that other sectors have thrived.Trump’s version of what happened after Biden moved away is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump says Joe Biden can only win by a 'rigged election.' That's wrong in several ways,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused the Democrats of using voting by mail as a way to ""rig"" the election.At one point, Trump said, ""So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election,"" he said.When we reached out to the White House, they pointed to mainstream media outlets that have reported that mail delays and late ballots were a problem in some primaries. Trump himself has often pointed to New York as an example. But these do not constitute evidence that Democrats, or anyone, are rigging the outcome.There are several other reasons that he could lose. For one, he faces the same challenges that any incumbent would face when running amid a pandemic that has killed more than 174,000 Americans and left millions unemployed. Here, we’ll look at more realistic scenarios that undermine Trump’s claim. States set laws about policies such as early voting hours or voter ID, but it’s local election officials who handle the day-to-day tasks of administering elections such as registering voters, sending ballots to voters’ homes, checking in voters at local precincts, and overseeing the machines at early voting and election day sites. There are more than 3,000 counties and 10,000 local jurisdictions spread across 50 states and D.C., said Paul Gronke, director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College. Each county produces its own ballots, and even within counties there can be various ballot versions with unique lists of federal, state and local offices, depending upon where a voter lives. Any attempt to rig a national election would pose multiple hurdles.Bar-coded envelopes for these ballots are ""just the first set of hurdles in trying to ‘rig’ an election,"" Gronke said.The next hurdle would be to fake each individual signature so well that it fools verification systems, and that voters don’t notice that someone else has cast their ballot before they did. Data scientists also track the returns closely and have sometimes been able to spot anomalies.A third complication for prospective election riggers is to figure out where to target their rigging efforts. In order to build a sufficient margin in the electoral college, they would have to guess in advance which states could tip the election. All of this would have to be done in a coordinated but secret way, with hundreds of people willing to risk felonies for the same goal. While mailed ballots pose a slightly higher risk of voter fraud than voting in person, fraud remains statistically rare. In the five states that have previously used all-mail elections, there have been very low rates of fraud, said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California-Irvine. And most of the time, voting fraud cases tend to be one-off events in local elections, not conspiracies capable of swinging a national election.But administrative problems have occurred not just with the voting by mail that Trump often derides but also with long lines at in-person precincts, and these have often been in jurisdictions that tend to vote Democratic. Using the term election rigging ""connotes some kind of fraud attempt to sabotage the casting of ballots,"" said Wendy Weiser, an elections expert at New York University’s liberal Brennan Center. ""Administrative snafus are a completely different thing.""Fundamentally, the possibility of a Trump loss could stem from political realities, not vote-rigging.""It will not take a rigged election for Trump to lose, just the ordinary workings of electoral accountability in a democracy,"" said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist.As of now, at least, Trump looks like an underdog for reelection, based on past history.""When an incumbent president is running for a second term, the election is always largely a referendum on the president’s record during his first term,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.Six presidents since World War II have been reelected. In descending order of their Gallup approval rating, they were Dwight Eisenhower (68%), Bill Clinton (57%), Richard Nixon (56%), Ronald Reagan (54%), George W. Bush (51%), and Barack Obama (45%).The two presidents who had the lowest approval ratings did not win reelection: George H.W. Bush (35%) and Jimmy Carter (32%).""Partisan polarization has drastically reduced the ability of incumbent office-holders at all levels to appeal to voters across party lines,"" Kondik said. ""And unlike previous incumbents, Trump has made little effort to expand his base of support during his time in office.""Often, presidents are judged heavily on the state of the economy on their watch. For much of Trump’s term, unemployment was low, boosting his prospects of a second term. However, 2020 has been a bad year, rocked by coronavirus, economic problems, and a sharp focus on systemic societal problems, like racial inequities in policing.That’s why some analysts like Abramowitz believe the public’s approval or disapproval of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus could be an important metric in determining his electoral prospects in November. And that trend line has not looked good for the president.In the states most likely to be decisive, Biden has also put together notable leads: 7.4 points in Michigan, 6.1 points in Pennsylvania, 6.8 points in Wisconsin, 5.4 points in Florida and 3.6 points in Arizona. Biden would need only the first three to reverse the 2016 result and achieve a Democratic victory.But Trump is not destined to lose, because intervening events could upset the status quo. The polls could be off; problems with the voting process during a pandemic could keep some voters’ ballots uncounted; and news events favorable to Trump or unfavorable to Biden could occur.But Trump said it was impossible for him to lose unless the election were rigged. That’s simply not the case.Trump said, ""So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election, and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election.""An actual conspiracy to rig the results of a national election would require hundreds or thousands of people working together to commit felonies across many critical jurisdictions. Experts do not consider this feasible, nor do we.Meanwhile, Trump is an incumbent facing several ongoing challenges: a major pandemic, high unemployment, civic unrest and future uncertainty. Those are significant political hurdles that would be challenging for any president. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump Jr. distorts Michigan data on dead voters,"That hasn’t stopped those concerned about an expected record number of absentee votes in Michigan this November from looking for signs of fraud in recent elections.Given the importance of absentee voting in Michigan this year, we took a closer look at the Trump tweet. We found that it takes misleading information from the Breitbart piece and compounds it with an outright false claim.For one thing, the 846 rejected ballots were cast not by dead people but by living people who then died before Election Day. For another, those ballots — which were not counted in the final results — made up about 8% of the rejected ballots, not 8% of the votes cast.In fact, these ballots accounted for barely 0.03% of the total votes cast, and none were counted.We reached out to the Trump re-election campaign for a comment but didn’t hear back.Ballots rejected in Michigan’s primary Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued the report on rejected ballots along with a call for legislation designed to reduce the number of ballots disqualified for late arrival or mismatched signatures.The remaining rejected ballots were deemed ineligible for a range of reasons, including missing or mismatched signatures or voters who changed addresses.Of the rejected ballots, 846 had to be tossed because the voters were deceased. These were not instances of someone completing and mailing an absentee ballot by stealing the identity of a deceased voter.  Rather, as Benson’s Aug. 14 release notes, they were cast by eligible Michigan voters who died after casting their ballots but before Election Day.These ballots accounted for just under 8% of the rejected absentee ballots. But including absent and in-person voters, Michigan saw more than 2.5 million votes cast in the Aug. 4 primary. Based on the total of counted and uncounted votes, the number of ballots from deceased voters accounted for about 0.03% of votes cast, meaning Trump overstated it by a factor of more than 200. And none of them were counted toward the final results.So Trump’s math is incorrect. He used the wrong denominator to claim that these ballots made up 8% of the total ""votes cast"" when in reality, they accounted for a minuscule share of the total votes cast.Rather than indicating instances of fraud, the rejected ballots show the state’s ability to detect and discount ineligible ballots.Our rulingDonald Trump Jr. claimed that the 846 ballots that were rejected because the voter was dead accounted for ""8% of the votes cast.""These 846 ballots were not fraudulently cast by someone assuming the identity of a dead person. They were cast by living voters who died before Election Day.These ballots accounted for nearly 8% of the total number of rejected ballots in the state’s August primary. They accounted for about 0.03% of the total votes cast. None of the rejected ballots were counted toward the final results.We rate this claim Pants on Fire. "

This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right )""2) 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.""3) 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.""4) Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.""5) Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.""6) Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.""7) The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.""8) Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.""9) 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.""10) In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish . (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.)""All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times.""The post also says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose picture accompanies the post, ""wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits (including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds)!""Let’s take a closer look at some of the post’s specific claims.When we contacted Mac Donald in 2018, she said, ""This information was given to me by a member of the (Los Angeles Police Department), who was making a rough estimate. It refers to fugitive warrants; homicide suspects who were in the country illegally often return to their home countries when they are sought on a warrant.""Even if this number was accurate at the time — and it was provided anonymously rather than being an official statistic — it is a ""rough estimate"" that is a decade and a half old. Those qualifications do not appear in the meme circulating today.Mac Donald never cited this figure in her 2005 testimony. We were unable to find any supporting evidence for it.Medi-Cal is the name of California’s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state, including, to a certain extent, undocumented immigrants.This is, at best, an assumption, because there’s no official data to back it up. Neither the FBI or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has officially estimated the percentage of gang members who are in the United States illegally.""The authors of the chain e-mail and the phony government report fear what Los Angeles has become — a multilingual, multiethnic city with multicultural tastes,"" Tobar wrote. ""They search for information to persuade others to be afraid, but the actual numbers don’t quite add up to the big monster they think is out there. So they make the numbers bigger. Or they just make them up. And they spread them around until all that fear and anger turns into a big hate.""Pelosi’s office told PolitiFact that ""internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated."" She added, ""My record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors.""Facebook posts said that according to the Los Angeles Times, ""95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens,"" more than two-thirds of all births in Los Angeles County ""are to illegal alien Mexicans"" on Medicaid, ""nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal,"" and Nancy Pelosi ""wants to put a windfall tax"" on retirement fund profits.The assertions in this post not only range from unsupported to incorrect, but they have been circulating consistently for almost a decade and a half despite repeated debunkings by fact-checkers as well as the Los Angeles Times itself.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

Trump particularly targeted a policy document recently agreed to by representatives of the Biden campaign as well as allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who gave Biden a strong challenge from the ideological left in the 2020 Democratic primaries.""The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by far, in American history,"" he said.Trump went on to call out many parts of the platform, including its policies on criminal justice.""We could go on for days,"" Trump said. ""Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They now want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess.""This is wildly untrue.The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries.But Biden explicitly rejected the ""defund the police"" label.So what does Biden support?The unity document backs a wide array of criminal-justice provisions, including decriminalization of marijuana by jurisdictions that want to do so and repealing federal mandatory minimum sentences.Not only does the unity document not say anything about abolishing the police, it includes several passages that are based on the assumption that there will be police going forward. They include:• ""We will require officer training in effective nonviolent tactics, appropriate use of force, implicit bias, and peer intervention, both at the academy and on the job.""• ""Democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve the neighborhoods they work in.""• ""Democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments, so our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve.

""Democrats support ending the use of private prisons and private detention centers.""But to equate that with abolishing all prisons, as Trump did, is highly misleading.Biden wants to change some aspects of prisons. ""We also believe that too many of our jails and prisons subject people to inhumane treatment, and will work to end practices like solitary confinement for adults and juveniles,"" the unity document says. Biden also supports reducing what he considers to be the outsized role of prisons in the criminal justice system.""Democrats know we can end the era of mass incarceration and dramatically reduce the number of Americans held in jails and prisons while continuing to reduce crime rates, which have fallen steadily from their peak nearly three decades ago,"" the unity document says.However, the document envisions that prisons will exist in the future, just with a different model of administration and changes for some of the policies they currently enforce.We’ll close by highlighting similarities between what Biden hopes to achieve and what Trump has already done.Trump said that a Biden-Sanders ""unity"" policy document shows that ""they want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess.""The document does not say anything about abolishing police departments or getting rid of all prisons.

PANTS-FIRE,Don’t trust this comparison of daily coronavirus deaths with other diseases,"A social media post says the novel coronavirus causes a small number of deaths compared with other diseases, essentially arguing that the coronavirus shouldn’t have forced such widespread economic shutdowns.According to the chart, the top five killers are tuberculosis (3,014 deaths), hepatitis B (2,430), pneumonia (2,216), HIV/AIDS (2,110), and malaria (2,002).About two-thirds of the way to the bottom of the list is the coronavirus, with just 56 daily deaths. Punctuated by a big red arrow, the post says, ""THIS is what collapsed the world economy.""We found that the post (seen below) is highly misleading. Here are some big problems with it. We researched the number of deaths from each of the diseases in the post and found some variation. But they were usually in the ballpark — except for COVID-19.Usually, cause-of-death data is released a couple of years after the fact and is subject to estimation. But coronavirus is such an urgent health threat, deaths are tabulated on a daily basis with a much smaller lag.We re-did the chart based on the best available data, including those three options for coronavirus deaths, marked in red: Both the April or July numbers for COVID-19 deaths are larger than for any of the other diseases. The closest is tuberculosis, with 3,452 deaths.""The original figure is incredibly misleading, especially if still being circulated today,"" said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.Unlike for most of the other diseases on this list, ""it needs to be pointed out that we have not yet had one year’s experience"" with the virus to have an accurate count and to understand the disease’s dynamics over time, said Nicole Gatto, associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University. It’s too early, she said, ""to fairly compare with these other causes of death.""In all, then, the notion that coronavirus is causing a piddling number of deaths is bunk.There’s not yet an effective drug or vaccine for coronavirus. That’s also the case for a few of the other diseases on the list, including norovirus, dengue fever, Ebola, SARS, and MERS.For most of the diseases on the list, however, we do have one or more effective tools. Vaccines exist for hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, seasonal flu, whooping cough, typhoid, cholera, meningitis, measles, rabies, yellow fever, and chicken pox, Nichols said.Effective treatments are available for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and malaria has an effective prophylaxis.But for COVID-19, not having an effective vaccine or treatment means that the only tool is to limit personal contact and maintain good hygiene. Doing this makes economic shutdowns a much more urgent tool for the coronavirus than for any of the other diseases on the list.While tuberculosis, measles, pneumonia, the seasonal flu, whooping cough, SARS, and MERS are spread by respiratory pathways, most of the others do not. They may spread through contaminated food or water, such as cholera; or bodily fluids, like HIV/AIDS; or animal vectors, such as malaria or rabies.Since respiratory diseases are particularly hard to control, they are more likely to require significant disruptions, such as economic shutdowns. You wouldn’t need a broad-scale economic shutdown to prevent HIV/AIDS, because it doesn’t spread through casual contact. For most of the other diseases on the list, you would mainly need a robust public health system.Some of the other diseases on this list aren’t apples to apples because they’re regional. Malaria and dengue are carried by certain types of mosquito, so if you don’t live near the mosquitoes, you won’t get the disease. The parasite that causes leishmaniasis tends to be found only in certain areas. For other diseases, many wealthier countries have been able to vaccinate to a level of herd immunity, reducing the risk of catching the illness in those places even if you’re unvaccinated.By contrast, the coronavirus spread within months to nearly everywhere in the world.The post said that only 56 coronavirus deaths a day was enough to collapse the world economy, even though thousands of people die daily from tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and other diseases.For starters, the post chose March 9 as its date for coronavirus deaths, which was right before deaths soared. Subsequent daily totals show that coronavirus deaths have become larger than any other disease on the list.In addition, coronavirus poses special risks that may need to be ameliorated by economic closures. It spreads through the air, there is no vaccine or treatment, and by now it’s established itself in most countries, so in many cases, limiting casual contact between people may be the only effective way of stopping the virus’ spread.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

NO SOCIAL DISTANCE.""Let’s take a closer look at that part of the claim.Did Democratic leaders including Pelosi huddle up as pictured without standard COVID-19 precautions?So the allegation of hypocrisy here is noteworthy, particularly with the supposed photographic proof.But the picture is not what it seems.So, of course, Pelosi and the others pictured would not be social distancing or wearing masks.And we’ll note, Pelosi has been very conscious of mask and social distancing recommendations.A Facebook post shows Pelosi and other Democratic leaders huddled together, criticizing them for not wearing masks or following social distancing guidelines.But the image is from December 2019, months before masks and distance became part of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic. Citing it as proof in a dramatically different landscape eight months later is ridiculous, particularly when Pelosi has actually been a strong supporter of mask-wearing and social distancing for herself and the Congressional body she oversees.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Claim that Tony Evers ordered U.S. flag removed is ridiculous,"When protesters gathered at the state Capitol in April to call for Gov. Tony Evers to reopen the state, the lack of an American flag at their chosen location became a point of contention.""Wisconsin Democrat Governor Evers removed the American flag from the Capitol building by ordering it to be taken down! This is beyond disgraceful!"" the post said.The text accompanied an undated photo showing protesters outside the Capitol building, with an empty flagpole circled in red.So did Evers really order the American flag removed at some point?Answering that means figuring out where and when this picture was taken. Let’s get to sleuthing.So the first question is which flagpole we’re talking about.The west wing of the Capitol houses the state Assembly, so that body is in charge of which flag flies when. The Assembly policy — like the state Senate — is to fly the American flag, but only when the body is in session.The other element is when this photo was taken, since it’s undated in the Facebook post.The most notable recent rally there occurred April 24, 2020, when protesters gathered to pressure Evers into reopening the state amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lone readable sign in the image — SCIENCE says ""OPEN WISCONSIN!"" — gives us the key clue here.So we have a picture from April 24 on the west wing of the Capitol.The protesters could have seen the American flag in its usual spot alongside the Wisconsin flag if they had walked around to the east side of the Capitol.The governor has authority over that flagpole and the north wing pole that flies the POW-MIA flag. The state Senate controls the remaining south wing flagpole.So the Facebook post in question is not only wrong that Evers had authority over the flagpole in question, it goes a step further by claiming the U.S. flag was absent because of a specific order from the governor.Britt Cudabeck, a spokeswoman for Evers, confirmed the governor did not order any U.S. flag taken down. The U.S. and Wisconsin flags have flown daily on the east pole as usual.A Facebook post claims Evers ordered the U.S. flag removed from the state Capitol, posting as support a picture of an empty flagpole.Our research shows that photo was taken seven weeks before the Facebook post in front of the west  wing of the Capitol, which is controlled by the state Assembly. The flag only flies when the Assembly is in session, and it wasn’t that day.So the post is not only wrong, it moves into the realm of the ridiculous by manufacturing the assertion that Evers had specifically ordered the flag removed.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Trump’s take on COVID testing gives short shrift to public health realities,"President Donald Trump sought to downplay the numbers associated with COVID-19 in the United States — which have passed 2 million confirmed cases and are nearing 120,000 lives lost — by arguing that the soaring national count was simply the result of superior testing.With that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president’s remarks are not only misleading — they’re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what’s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.Essentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more – and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do.""We will show more — more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don’t talk about it,"" he added.But that isn’t true.But this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries – so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others.For instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.’s.""We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,"" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Put another way, a larger health crisis means — even after controlling for population size — the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)And while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don’t have sufficient systems in place — from facilities to staff to medical supplies — for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us.And what about the president’s assertion that ""if we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases"" or none at all?On its literal phrasing, it’s absurd, experts said.""The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That’s because testing doesn’t create instances of the virus — it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.)But even if you take it figuratively – the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic – it’s still misleading.""We’re seeing a lot of cases because we’re testing? It just doesn’t ring true,"" Kates said. ""The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished.""The president’s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated – and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. ""If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,"" Blendon said. ""If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he’s gone.""But the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus.That gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn’t the only data source to reveal the pandemic’s existence. Let’s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus’s absence. Trump argued that the nation’s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect.The most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn’t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we’re probably still undercounting compared to other countries.Testing doesn’t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it.And in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public’s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn’t conceal it.

All other fireworks are not permitted, failure to comply will result in immediate detention."" And: ""All citizens will be allowed 30 minutes outside for celebration time. Social Distancing must be practiced as always, for safety purposes. Hugging, kissing or touching of any kind will not be permitted. Failure to comply may result in multiple fines up to $1,200 to be assessed per occurrence.""It concludes with a recommendation to look at videos of fireworks from last year, instead, and bears signatures of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford.Even though the poster includes an image of the Maryland state seal, it seems to have nothing to do with the state of Maryland. In fact, it appears to have been created as a joke. Comments on the post were mixed, with some people expressing outrage and others calling it out as fake.""The author would have the reader believe Governor Hogan has issued a directive on a specific way to handle sparklers as well as a limited time celebrating outdoors. This poster is simply fake and was produced without the authority of the Governor's Office or the Office of the State Fire Marshal. We would not direct citizens on a specific time to be outside and recommend the latest CDC guidelines on how to properly socially distance.

PANTS-FIRE,Conspiracy claim linking COVID-19 reports with the number 322 is nonsense,"Some people can’t resist a good conspiracy.Turns out, many also can’t resist one that’s exceptionally easy to disprove.An array of Facebook posts recently surfaced singling out the number 322 and a purported connection to COVID-19. In a social media landscape rife with claims about manufactured COVID case and death tallies, and conspiracies related to vaccines, 5G cell towers and whatever else, the clear implication is there’s something nefarious going on.That post was accompanied by 17 different photos noting the number 322 in headlines dating back to March.We found at least 15 different versions of this claim scattered across Facebook, together shared thousands of times.Sigh.Allow us to point out the obvious.You can find this supposed connection to COVID-19 with just about any number in the low three-digit range.We’re in the midst of a global pandemic that is unprecedented in this age of media saturation. All manner of local and regional publications have been reporting on COVID-19 case and death numbers for months.There is no time in history where this many media outlets have been so focused for this long on one singular topic — particularly one in which counting stats are so critical and readily available through online searches.In other words, there are a lot of media outlets posting a lot of numbers.And America really loves units of government.Add that to the 50 states and, well, the entire rest of the world, and you’ve got a lot of places tallying COVID data that could potentially add up to 322.But in case you’re somehow not convinced yet, we’ll follow the advice of one poster and Google this.We ran a Google News search using the terms ""322 cases"" AND COVID, to find online references to where ""322 cases"" appeared as a unit on a page that also referenced COVID.Then we did the same with the numbers around 322. Here’s what we found as of about noon on June 16, 2020.""320 cases"" AND COVID — 8,660 results (larger, since many reports round off the numbers)""321 cases"" AND COVID — 1,170 results""322 cases"" AND COVID — 1,960 results""323 cases"" AND COVID — 2,240 results""324 cases"" AND COVID — 1,600 results""325 cases"" AND COVID — 2,530 resultsWe’ll spare you another set of bullets, but searches with the word ""deaths"" in place of ""cases"" yields the same type of results.In other words, you can find COVID-19 media reports citing any number in that range.An array of Facebook posts claim a link between the number 322 and COVID-19 in media reports.The implication is that there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported.But even in the context of social media in 2020, this is ridiculous.The volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits.Google searches prove out that 322 isn’t even a particularly common number.We rate this Pants on Fire."

A bystander recorded his fatal encounter with police on May 25. ""We acknowledge that there are some people who are simply going to be uncomfortable dealing with police officers who are wearing masks,"" a spokesman for the police department said at the time. Even with the requirements, mask use has been inconsistent across the United States. In the recording of Floyd’s death, some people, including officers, are not wearing masks. Around the 2:25 minute mark in this Post video, security footage shows an officer arriving on the scene wearing a face covering. After he gets out of the car, he puts on gloves.Around the 6:15 mark, another person standing among a gathering crowd can be seen wearing a face mask. Around the 6:39 mark, a man in a brown uniform can be seen wearing a mask as he helps load Floyd’s stretcher into an ambulance.We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Claim that N95 masks can’t stop COVID-19 particles due to size is nonsense,"As many states and communities ease restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the debate over mask usage has intensified.Businesses, churches and governments have implemented all manner of policies — some requiring masks, some leaving it up to each person, some even banning masks.That has spurred many armchair epidemiologists to weigh in, including a Facebook page with nearly 1 million followers.""COVID 19 virus particle size is 125 nanometers (0.125 microns); the range is 0.06 microns to .14 microns,"" the post said. ""The N95 mask filters down to 0.3 microns. So, N95 masks block few, if any, virions (virus particles).""In other words, the post asserts the virus is smaller than the filter on the N95 mask, so the N95 mask doesn’t work.But that’s ridiculous.Experts say this claim flies in the face of numerous studies and reflects a failure to grasp fundamental principles of how viruses behave and how face masks work.Here’s what we found.The science of mask functionality gets really small, really fast. The unit of measurement here is microns — 1/1000th of a millimeter.The size-based argument against N95 laid out in this claim assumes mask filtering works something like water flowing through a net — particles in the water smaller than the net opening pass through, while larger items don’t.But the physics involved don’t work like that at all.The COVID-19 particle is indeed around 0.1 microns in size, but it is always bonded to something larger.The virus attaches to water droplets or aerosols (i.e. really small droplets) that are generated by breathing, talking, coughing, etc. These consist of water, mucus protein and other biological material and are all larger than 1 micron.""Breathing and talking generate particles around 1 micron in size, which will be collected by N95 respirator filters with very high efficiency,"" said Lisa Brosseau, a retired professor of environmental and occupational health sciences who spent her career researching respiratory protection.But that’s not the only logical flaw in this claim.The N95 filter is indeed physically around the 0.3 micron size. But that doesn’t mean it can only stop particles larger than that. It works well for particles above that size, and actually snares particles below that size better than those at exactly the 0.3 level.""N95 have the worst filtration efficiency for particles around 0.3,"" Marr said. ""If you’re smaller than that those are actually collected even better. It’s counterintuitive because masks do not work like sieving out larger particles. It’s not like pasta in a colander and small ones don’t get through.""Why do they work better for smaller ones? There are a number of factors at play, but here are two main ones noted by experts:The first is something called ""Brownian motion,"" the name given to a physical phenomenon in which particles smaller than 0.3 microns move in an erratic, zig-zagging kind of motion. This motion greatly increases the chance they will be snared by the mask fibers.The second is the N95 mask itself uses electrostatic absorption, meaning particles are drawn to the fiber and trapped, instead of just passing through.A Facebook post said the ""N95 masks block few, if any"" COVID-19 particles due to their size.This claim — attempting to disprove a fundamental piece of protective gear used by healthcare professionals around the world — is nonsense.The COVID-19 virus itself is indeed smaller than the N95 filter size, but the virus always travels attached to larger particles that are consistently snared by the filter. And even if the particles were smaller than the N95 filter size, the erratic motion of particles that size and the electrostatic attraction generated by the mask means they would be consistently caught as well.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that he gave Jim Mattis the nickname 'Mad Dog',"President Donald Trump has often lashed out at those who criticize him, especially if they are former insiders.Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it. His nickname was “Chaos”, which I didn’t like, & changed to “Mad Dog”...In reality, though, Mattis’ ""Mad Dog"" nickname was in common circulation long before Trump tapped him for his cabinet. It dates back at least as far as 2004, and probably well before that. (The White House and the Trump campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article.)Later that year, the Los Angeles Times published another article that referred to the nickname, saying that the general was ""known as ‘Mad Dog Mattis’ to his men.""General James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!Trump said that Mattis’ ""nickname was ‘Chaos,’ which I didn’t like, & changed to ‘Mad Dog.’""This is the second time that Trump has said he gave Mattis his ""Mad Dog"" nickname, but it’s flat wrong.

Floyd, 46, died after a white officer kneeled on his neck for minutes following his arrest.The district’s police — the Metropolitan Police Department — were assisting the uniformed Secret Service officers during the May 29 protests, despite Trump’s claims.""The Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Park Police were on the scene,"" the agency said.""No one needed to ask the Metropolitan Police Department to get involved because we were already involved,"" she continued. ""Our police were doing their jobs from the start. D.C. police supported uniformed Secret Service last night like we have done literally dozens of times at Lafayette Park.""Bowser said the district’s police were coordinating with the Secret Service and U.S. Park Police throughout the night on May 29 and into the early morning on May 30.The night’s protests included more than 1,000 people at their peak, and a much smaller number remained in Lafayette Park until 3:45 a.m. on May 30, said district police chief Peter Newsham. The White House and Lafayette Park, Newsham noted, are under federal jurisdiction and managed by the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. But the district police stay in communication with both agencies and often work in tandem to manage major protests.When large-scale demonstrations do take place, the district police establish a ""unified command"" with other local and federal law enforcement agencies to ""collectively make decisions on how to proceed,"" Newsham said.""All of the decisions that are made in an instance like this (are) made in a unified command.

It’s a private company, and it hasn’t blocked Trump’s speech.""Assuming Trump means to suggest that Twitter has violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech, he is completely wrong,"" said Mary Anne Franks, professor of law at the University of Miami School of Law.""They’re not stifling free speech — they’re exercising free speech,"" added UCLA School of Law professor Eugene Volokh. ""They are letting him speak, but responding to the speech with their own. That’s their First Amendment right, just as it’s his First Amendment right to criticize them.""""The First Amendment was specifically designed to protect you against the government,"" said Kate Klonick, assistant professor of law at St. John’s University School of Law.Twitter isn’t a public utility or an arm of the government. ""There’s no right to speech on Twitter, a private platform,"" said Ellen Goodman, professor of law at Rutgers Law School.As a private entity, Twitter can set its own terms of service and strike or flag posts accordingly, said Nicole Ligon, the supervising attorney of the First Amendment Clinic at Duke Law.""The president’s free speech is not impaired simply because he disagrees with Twitter’s policies,"" Ligon said, noting that ""he has plenty of other channels"" to speak freely.""They censor speech all the time that is constitutionally protected,"" such as nudity and hate speech, added Ashutosh Bhagwat, professor of law at the UC Davis School of Law.The second problem with Trump’s claim is that Twitter has marked one post, a move that legal experts said is itself protected under the First Amendment.""Twitter did not delete his false claims, but merely added the option of accessing correct information to them,"" Franks said. ""This is a very modest exercise of another treasured free speech value, namely counterspeech."" Volokh, the UCLA law professor, said protections for counterspeech trace back to a ""famous line"" from former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. ""Simply responding to speech with speech of your own is the very sort of ‘counterspeech’ that the Supreme Court has said is the proper response for speech with which one disagrees,"" Volokh said. It’s possible that Trump was speaking of free speech in a more vague way. In a general sense, people often ""conflate the robust rights that they’re guaranteed under the First Amendment with general freedom of speech principles,"" Klonick told us.But that argument also falls flat in this case. Franks said it would be ""nonsensical,"" since Twitter didn’t remove anything but instead ""offered correct speech in response to incorrect speech.""If Twitter started taking down Trump’s tweets, Volokh said, then people could reasonably argue that the platform was stifling free speech in this broader sense, even if such action wouldn’t cross the First Amendment’s free speech clause. But that’s not what Twitter is doing.""What would be a violation is if the government told Twitter to ban Trump’s speech, and then only his speech as a private person, and not the office of the presidency,"" Goodman said.The bigger First Amendment threat, experts told us, is Trump’s vow to take action against Twitter — something he can’t unilaterally do.""The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump,"" Klonick said. ""The First Amendment doesn’t protect Trump from Twitter.""Trump said, ""Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH.""Six legal experts told us Trump is wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump falsely claims Michigan illegally sent ballots to all voters,"President Donald Trump’s crusade against voting by mail has put him at odds with the truth again. This time, he took aim at Michigan’s latest effort to expand access to absentee ballots.The action follows a constitutional amendment to expand access to absentee ballots, which Michiganders supported overwhelmingly in a 2018 ballot issue.""Hi I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia,"" Benson tweeted. At the local level, some elections officials in heavily Democratic and Republican counties around the country are mailing voters information on how to apply for an absentee ballot.

(Never mind that no vaccination currently exists.)But that is not at all what the administration proposed. Let’s take a look.When asked for evidence to back up the Facebook post, the Republican Party of Kenosha County said it reposted the message from someone else and pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Evers administration’s proposed rules. It’s unclear where the post originated. ""The proposed rule will implement measures to reduce and slow the rate of infection of COVID-19, to reduce strain on the health care system, to mitigate economic hardship, and to save lives,"" the document states.Nothing in the statement of scope suggests state officials planned to shut down the state for 150 more days, plus an extension. Nor did the previous order that it’s based on.(And remember, the Evers order challenged by the GOP was 13 days away from expiring when the Supreme Court ruled.)Moreover, a phased reopening based on public health is hardly a complete shutdown as the Facebook post implies. ""That’d be a lie,"" Evers said.A Facebook post shared by conservative groups in Wisconsin said Evers was proposing a five-month shutdown of the state, plus a 120-day extension.At no time did the Evers administration suggest this. The Supreme Court ruling meant Evers had to turn to the emergency rulemaking process through the Legislature.

PANTS-FIRE,COVID-19 vs. HPV vaccine: COVID is more deadly,"Iowa state Rep.  Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, is telling Iowans he wants younger Iowans to get back to work as the state begins to reopen, tweeting April 28 that ""seeing so many young people afraid of re-opening the economy because of the virus...Someone should tell them they have a greater chance of being killed by the HPV vaccine than COVID-19.""  Shipley said in a phone interview with *The Daily Iowan* he did not have data to support his point about young people having a greater chance of being killed by the HPV vaccine than COVID-19 so we checked, and found his statement to be inaccurate. The vaccine can prevent cancer-causing HPV infections. Shipley said in the interview he wanted to raise a point that young people have less risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 than older adults. He said young people should return to work, though public health experts say it isn’t safe for them to do so yet. ""What I’ve seen is a lot of young people are voicing that they’d much rather stay on welfare or unemployment than go back to work, and now they’re kind of complaining that they have to go to work, and they’re saying they don’t feel safe,"" Shipley said. ""I was really upset and kind of angry. And they say they are unsafe, but there’s really no data to support that."" Christine Petersen, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Disease at the University of Iowa, said in a phone interview the risk of dying of COVID-19 is higher, given that no deaths have ever been linked to the HPV vaccine.The HPV vaccine prevents the most common types of human papillomavirus strains, which can cause cervical and other cancers. ""Roughly, for every 100,000 people in the state of Iowa, there are five who have had cervical cancer, there’s been zero that have died from the vaccine. We know that across the Iowa population, 7.27 people out of 100,000 have died of coronavirus,"" Peterson said. Shipley said he believes people who are most at risk should be social distancing, while younger adults can return to work. ""There’s a lot of ways we can protect ourselves and enforce social distancing between myself and my parents and my grandparents or whoever it is,"" Shipley said. ""Just because there are people at risk, that doesn’t necessarily mean we all need to stay home, collect government checks, and not go to work."" Petersen warned that separating those at-risk from those who are not is not an easy task. ""I would caution that it’s not so easy to target at risk or not at-risk people,"" Petersen said. ""You can be undiagnosed with a disease that can cause you to be impressively immune compromised and not even know it yourself yet, or you can not want to declare it to the rest of the world."" Petersen said COVID-19 still has a reproductive rate of 2 in Iowa, meaning on average, each positive case will spread the virus to two others. ""Those people may not show symptoms for at least a day, maybe two, so taking precautions isn’t just to protect yourself, it’s to protect those at risk people,"" Petersen said. Shipley wrote that young people are more at risk from the HPV vaccine than COVID-19. Both the CDC and the WHO have concluded that no deaths have been caused by the HPV vaccine, while young people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S and in Iowa. While young people are less at risk from the coronavirus than older people, adhering to social distancing protects people at risk of having greater complications from the coronavirus – including those who might not yet know they are at a higher risk. Moreover, Shipley conceded that he made the statement in order to start a discussion, not to give accurate information that could be taken literally. We rated Shipley’s claim as Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the media did not “pretend there was a deadly surge in COVID cases” after Wisconsin election","A far-right news broadcast shared widely on Facebook says the ""mainstream media"" is misleading people about Wisconsin’s mid-pandemic election.The election has remained a hot topic nationally, as it was effectively a study in what can happen when a large number of people go out in public together amid a lockdown order. It’s a unique datapoint as politicians and citizens alike argue over how and when to re-open.And one TV outlet says you’re being lied to about it.""There is no evidence to date that there was a surge of infections due to the April 7, 2020, election in Wisconsin. … But did the mainstream media report on this? No, no,"" she said. ""In fact, the mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting.""  But her generalization about ""mainstream media"" claiming otherwise? That’s ridiculous.Let’s take a closer look at how this topic has been covered by prominent media outlets. For starters, let’s be clear that there was no election ""surge.""As of May 11, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services identified 71 people who tested positive for COVID-19 after voting or working the polls in the April 7 election, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt. The important caveat here is that it’s impossible to say how many were infected at the polls since some reported other possible exposures.Now on to the ""mainstream media"" reports.Wheeler’s report cites no sources for the claim the media said there was a surge in cases, so we cast a wide net looking at news coverage ourselves.In-state sources were even more clear. ""The data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days’ new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days.""Both the article and the tweet it was based on were removed after that fact-check published.We won’t bother to dive deeper into Wheeler’s ""pretended"" claim. That adds another layer of absurdity since it implies some kind of intentional coverup or falsehood, when there’s no proof the coverage was wrong in the first place.The One America News Network claimed in a video posted to Facebook that ""mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting.""We didn’t find a single traditional or ""mainstream"" news outlet that characterized the election-related cases as a surge or anything close to that — much less anything that would support this kind of sweeping generalization.The reports prominently noted the caveat that officials can’t say for certain that the election caused the cases we are aware of, and they had made no exaggerated claims about how large those numbers were. (And, to be clear, the 71 cases certainly don’t constitute a surge.)So Wheeler is flat wrong in both her claim about coverage and the related implication from the use of ""pretended"" that something was reported wrong intentionally.We rate this Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Viral post alleging Obama-era device tax caused current PPE shortage is way off,"Alongside a photo of Obama, the text of the Facebook post says: ""Let me be clear. I signed the medical appliance tax bill that forced companies to outsource manufacturing of masks, gowns, gloves and ventilaors [sic] to China, Europe and Russia to avoid the tax."" The image piqued our interest because it combined a few hot-button issues. First, the concern that the U.S. is experiencing a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, or PPE, like masks, gowns and gloves to help protect front-line workers from coronavirus. Second, issues related to trade imbalances and the outsourcing of American manufacturing abroad are likely to be frequent themes on the presidential campaign trail. So we decided to dig in.Before we get into the specifics of the medical device tax, two critical elements of the post must be addressed. First, did Obama ever say anything like what the viral image claims? We checked with Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president. In an email he wrote back: ""President Obama obviously didn’t say this!"" A key piece of evidence that supports Schultz’s statement is the use of the term ""medical appliance device tax bill.""Bottom line: We couldn’t find any other reference — either official or unofficial — to a piece of federal legislation bearing this name or nickname. And, though the experts we spoke with agreed the social media post was likely directed at the device tax included in the ACA, none had ever heard it referred to with that moniker — a point that adds more skepticism to the image’s claim.In order to pay for the ACA’s expansion of health coverage, taxes were increased for various industries — including the medical device industry — that would benefit from more people getting health insurance. The tax was controversial and triggered considerable pushback. The measure set a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, sold in the United States beginning in January 2013. The tax applied to both domestic manufacturers and importers of medical devices. But, it did not apply to items made in the U.S. for foreign export, said John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who also served as a senior adviser during the Obama administration and helped write the Affordable Care Act.  ""The tax was designed deliberately"" to avoid forcing manufacturers to move their production overseas, McDonough wrote in an email. Joseph Antos, a health policy scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said that the tax was punishing on the medical device industry because it was implemented on ""gross sales rather than profits,"" which raised issues for small device firms.   Antos said that though the tax ""clearly"" had an effect on the industry, he wasn't aware of any studies or statistics that showed production and sales moving overseas because of it.  But Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow and expert in health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, took an even harder line on the social media image’s assertion. ""It’s absolutely false on the face of it,"" he said. ""There was no way the tax provided any incentive to shift production overseas.""  Van de Water also said that while there was some shift of manufacturing overseas while the tax was in effect, there were other factors leading that push, such as competition and pressure to reduce costs. ""There’s no way to attribute that to the device tax itself,"" he added.  ""The tax was only in effect for three years, from 2013 to 2015,"" said Van de Water. ""Even if it [the medical device tax] had some effect, that effect would have ended in 2016. We’re now four years later."" So finally, does the now non-existent medical device tax have anything to do with our current PPE shortage in the face of the coronavirus pandemic?The answer to that is also no, said the experts.  The current personal protective equipment shortage can be attributed to the lack of a stockpile reserve of PPE, an initial slow response by the U.S. and the tariffs imposed against Chinese goods by the Trump administration, said Peter Petri, a professor of international finance at Brandeis University outside Boston. AEI’s Antos considered it an issue of the huge demand for these items, which has made replenishing stockpiles more difficult.""For nearly a year, U.S. buyers have been moving their PPE business away from China to other countries because of the Trump tariff wall,"" Petri wrote in an email.But those manufacturers in other countries were not able to scale up their production to make up for the amount of supplies needed when the coronavirus hit.""Meanwhile Chinese suppliers were turning to markets in Europe. The U.S. could not have chosen a worse time to turn its back on the world's largest PPE producer,"" said Petri.  China’s massive manufacturing capacity did allow it to scale up production to account for the coronavirus pandemic, but because it had already established businesses in other locales and in response to the imposed tariffs, Petri suggested, it is unlikely now that China would be as receptive to U.S. requests for PPE.Nothing in this viral image is accurate. There is even a spelling error. Obama did not sign anything into law called the ""medical appliance tax bill."" A moratorium was placed on the medical device tax he did sign into law as part of the Affordable Care Act in late 2015. Therefore, that tax was put on hold in 2016 and eventually repealed by Trump in 2019. Instead, experts we consulted agreed that the current PPE shortage is more aptly linked to the inadequate national emergency stockpile of PPE, increased demand for the products and the Trump administration’s Chinese trade policies. Our ruling is Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's claim that US tested more than all countries combined is Pants on Fire wrong,"We emailed the White House for comment but never heard back, so we turned to the data. Trump’s claim didn’t stand up to scrutiny.In raw numbers, the United States has tested more people than any other individual country — but nowhere near more than ""every country combined"" or, as he said in his tweet, more than ""all major countries combined.""Regardless, raw test numbers aren’t a meaningful metric in gauging the nation’s coronavirus response. When you factor in population size — which experts say is essential in understanding how well we are doing — the U.S. still falls short.All of them place the U.S. total above 5 million tests — the figures range between 5.59 and 5.7 million. And it is correct that no other country has run so many diagnostic tests. But that’s where any semblance of accuracy ends.But those are hardly all the world’s ""major countries"" — let alone ""every country."" And to argue the list is exhaustive is absurd, experts said -- especially since it doesn’t include Germany and Spain, which are among Europe’s biggest economies. Additionally, Germany’s robust testing strategy has been credited with its low coronavirus death rate and Russia, also not on that list, is obviously an important player on the world stage.And when you look at European countries alone — which again, is far short of what he claimed — Trump’s comparison quickly falls apart.The Worldometer data shows that, when you add up the number of tests run in Russia, Germany and Italy, the total lands around 6.72 million. You could also tally the number of tests run in Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the U.K. Both Worldometer and Our World in Data place that total above 6 million. Either way, it’s more than what the U.S. has done.Big picture, a truly exhaustive sum of testing by ""every country"" or even ""all major countries"" would generate higher numbers.Trump is also fixating on the wrong figures, global health experts said.""The highest number of raw tests in and of itself is not meaningful for any particular country or location within a country,"" said Jennifer Kates, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)The United States has a far bigger population than many of the ""major countries"" Trump often mentions. So it could have run far more tests but still have a much larger burden ahead than do nations like Germany, France or Canada.There are other useful metrics: for one, how many people tested positive for COVID-19 compared with the overall number of people tested. Another useful measure is the per capita rate of testing, or the percentage of the nation’s population that has been tested for the virus.On both counts, the United States still underperforms.Hanage pointed out that Germany, Ireland, Belgium and Canada have all tested a much larger percentage of the population than the United States has.Arguably the more important metric, Hanage said, is the percentage of positive test results. A low percentage indicates a nation is aggressively testing, while a higher percentage suggests the country is testing only very sick people — increasing the likelihood that its tracking system is missing cases of infection, undercounting how many people are COVID-positive. And by this measure, the United States fares far worse than a number of countries, including Canada and Germany.As Kates put it, ""increasing the number of tests is important, but a raw number of tests doesn’t tell you much"" about what’s needed, or how well the country is faring.Trump claimed that the United States has ""tested more than every country combined.""There is no reasonable way to conclude that the American system has run more diagnostics than ""all other major countries combined."" Just by adding up a few other nations’ totals, you can quickly see Trump’s claim fall apart.Plus, focusing on the 5 million figure distracts from the real issue — by any meaningful metric of diagnosing and tracking, the United States is still well behind countries like Germany and Canada.The president’s claim is not only inaccurate but also ridiculous.

Another unsubstantiated conspiracy,"A widespread Facebook post falsely claims that former Vice President Joe Biden was once part of a scheme to kidnap John F.

None of the plots involved Biden, who was a senator from 1973 to 2009, when he became vice president.Biden was mentioned in the FBI files as a ""victim"" — not as a suspect. But the case was eventually closed with no suspects identified, according to the records. ""There is no mention, none at all, of a Biden attempt to kidnap JFK Jr.,"" Gillon said.

PANTS-FIRE,"Early date on CARES Act is due to a legislative quirk, not a plot","The $2.2 trillion act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures.The page captured in the screenshot lists the bill as having been introduced on Jan. 24, 2017. That’s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a long-planned event.The poster added the comment, ""Clearly a PLAN-DEMIC. Guess what they have planned next for you. Hint — None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 — It's much worse than you could ever imagine.""In reality, there’s a mundane explanation for why the bill was introduced well before the pandemic itself, and it has nothing to do with a government plot. But explaining it requires a short lesson in constitutional law and how Congress works.Sometimes, lawmakers decide that revenue-related legislation must pass urgently, and the shortest path is to skip the normal House-to-Senate process.While the Democratic House majority did offer a version of the bill, negotiators from the White House and the Senate were already deep into talks about what should be in the bill. When the Senate came up with a version of the bill that the leaders in both parties could support, they drew up the legislative text to be voted on.However, because of the constitutional rule on tax-related bills, the senators didn’t create a new Senate bill. Instead, they took an existing bill that had been passed by the House but not by the Senate. The Senate stripped out the language, inserted the new CARES Act wording into the shell, and voted on it. It passed unanimously, and was later passed by the House and signed by President Donald Trump.What the Senate did is a ""commonly used workaround,"" said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative procedure.The bill never made it to a vote in the Senate, making the measure ripe for the picking when Senate leaders went looking for a House-passed measure where the CARES Act language could be swapped in. The bill that passed the Senate ""bears zero resemblance to the original bill,"" Koger said. And the introduction date signifies nothing about when the government knew of the coronavirus.The process used to enact the CARES Act, Koger said, shows that ""the modern Congress often bears little resemblance to the ‘How a Bill Becomes a Law’ lessons"" people learn in school.Facebook posts said the government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier.The introduction date cited in the post was off by two years, and the post is a misunderstanding of how the bill moved through Congress. Because of a constitutional requirement that tax-related bills originate in the House, the senators who drew up the CARES Act used a common workaround, stripping an existing House-passed bill of its old text and inserting the new text into it. So there’s nothing fishy about a coronavirus relief bill having been introduced prior to the pandemic’s emergence. The original text of the bill that eventually became the CARES Act was on an entirely different topic.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

He is clearly holding only a yellow flag.The implication is that in its photo, the Journal Sentinel added the Confederate flag into the man’s hands.On April 18, the reporter who wrote the news story sent the photo in question from his iPhone to an editor who loaded it directly into the Journal Sentinel's publishing system.The photo shows the man holding a yellow Don't Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag together on one pole. On April 19, a Journal Sentinel photo editor examined the photo and determined it was never edited in Photoshop, even to receive the basic color-toning for reproduction.The article also pointed out that other images taken at the rally, including two videos posted on social media, show a man with the two flags.(Confederate flag is visible at the 9-second mark in this tweeted video.)The Journal Sentinel reporter on the scene also captured an image in which both men can be seen. The photos are time-stamped at 11:40 and 11:41 a.m.In English: There’s no forensic evidence that the image was doctored. A Facebook post showing two photographs from a rally that protested coronavirus stay-at-home orders suggests that one of the photos, taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was doctored.Our analysis found the photo, which shows one man holding a Don’t Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag, was not altered.

You can’t point to any clause of the Constitution that supports that,"" said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and political science professor at Hamline University. When the framers drafted the Constitution, they kept in mind fear of King George III and wanted to avoid absolute power of a king, Schultz said. The Constitution aims to break up political power.""That’s why the president doesn’t have total power,"" he said.Trump said he has ""total"" authority to reopen the states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Trump and the White House have not explained what parts of the Constitution or laws he is referring to that he thinks give him ""total"" authority over governors. Governors have the power to set rules to protect their residents’ public health such as closing swimming pools and schools and requiring social distancing.

PANTS-FIRE,Hochul rewrites history with ventilator claim,"Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul has been talking to news outlets across New York State about the Covid-19 crisis. Anchor Luke Moretti asked Hochul: ""What’s the situation with the ventilators? I know there was that bit of a back and forth between upstate, downstate a little while ago? Where do we stand right now? Are we in good shape with ventilators?"" ""Well, we always have been in good shape with ventilators,"" Hochul replied. Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""was simply trying to get an inventory to see if there are communities where there is a surplus of ventilators and he was simply saying if we can share 20 percent of your excess, your non-used ventilators, to help people in other parts of the state on a voluntary basis, that would be great. And, of course, there was a reaction to that, which was not positive, and that’s unfortunate, because I think that we always respond in a way that we look out for each other."" She further described how first responders pitch in during snowstorms in other parts of the state, adding ""we were never going to leave anyone in Western New York without the support they need."" She also said the urgent need for ventilators has subsided somewhat because of shipments of the breathing equipment from other states and China.   We were struck that she said Cuomo was ""simply saying"" that hospitals could share their ventilators on a ""voluntary"" basis. During a press briefing, Cuomo said that more ventilators were necessary to meet the state’s needs, and that he has been working with suppliers in China. ""But we are going to have to redeploy ventilators from across the system,"" he said. ""In other words, there are hospitals that have ventilators. There are hospitals that have (personal protective) equipment. There are private-sector companies that have PPE equipment that they are not using that we are going to need to redeploy to the places in the hospitals where we need them,"" he said. Cuomo also acknowledged during the briefing that hospital administrators who would lose ventilators under his plan are upset. ""I had a conversation with a hospital administrator yesterday,"" he said. ""I understand they don't want to give up their ventilators. Ventilators are expensive pieces of equipment. I understand that, even if they're not using them, they are reluctant to see them go out the door. The theory is if the government gets them, they will never get them back. I understand that. But I don't have an option.""He added later: ""I'm going to sign an executive order that says the state can take ventilators and (personal protective equipment) from institutions that don't need them now and redeploy them to other parts of the state and other hospitals that do need them. Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator.""""So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am,"" Cuomo said. The executive order that Cuomo described on April 3 was never signed. Hochul's answer to Moretti, the news broadcaster, came on April 8, one day after Cuomo signed an executive order that hospital executives found to be more cooperative than how the governor initially described it. We reached out to Hochul’s office, and her spokesperson, Bryan Lesswing, said: ""The lieutenant governor was giving a status update on New York State's close coordination with hospitals to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, calling for state unity not division, and reinforcing Western New York's preparedness. Any other characterization is simply untrue and an unfair attack while New York State government officials have been consistently transparent in keeping New Yorkers updated with the latest facts.""Hochul’s office also said that there was nothing contradictory in what Hochul said because the state was indeed working with hospitals to share equipment on a voluntary basis, and that she was speaking broadly about the current status with ventilators and then talked about the dialogue between upstate and downstate in Moretti’s question. Hochul said Cuomo was simply saying that hospitals could share 20 percent of their unused ventilators on a voluntary basis. That’s not how hospital executives and other elected officials heard Cuomo describe his initial plan, thus explaining the immediate backlash. And those who listened to the governor’s televised briefing heard him say this: ""So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am."" Parsing that quote to find any semblance of ""voluntary"" is beyond challenging.Cuomo said the state would move hospital equipment from one part of the state to harder-hit areas that desperately needed them because of the Covid-19 outbreak. When the plan changed, after significant backlash, hospitals and others praised the administration for acting collaboratively. Hochul misled viewers about what happened. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.  "

""Thank you for your mail. … Finally, something to laugh about.""Protecting against the virusDuring the interview, Gohmert mentioned that a company in Arizona was developing a similar product, but his team did not return a request for more information about the company or its product.A thorough web search did not return results for news stories or company websites for a business that may be working on producing this kind of powder-like product that can kill the coronavirus on contact.None of these products registered with the EPA are approved for use on people. They are strictly surface disinfectants.There are some products that are powder-based and can be combined with water and used in a liquid form, Cross said. But like all of the disinfectants on the list, the product is a liquid and has a set contact time — the amount of time a surface needs to stay wet with a product for it to be effective.Cross said this time varies by product, ranging from 15 seconds to 15 minutes.""The idea that it would have residual activity after the surface is no longer wet to kill that virus is incredibly surprising to me, because I haven’t found any other products that have those similar claims,"" she said of the powder Gohmert described.The WHO guidelines also emphasize the importance of ""environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures"" and state that washing surfaces with ""water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures.""Wegner of the German Hospital Association echoed these recommendations.""The only protection against the virus are personal protection equipment – masks, disposable coats and gloves – and proper hygiene,"" he said.Our rulingGohmert said that there is a powder substance that, when mixed with water, is being used as a disinfecting mist in Germany.""Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything that’s been sprayed it is killed,"" he said.But no such product seems to exist and no similar product is in use in Germany.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump claims his judicial endorsement caused Tony Evers to attempt election delay. It didn't,"The mid-pandemic election in Wisconsin yielded no shortage of bizarre storylines.But a noteworthy one emerged late in the day when President Donald Trump tried to put himself at the center of a debate over whether the election should have even been held as scheduled.The April 7, 2020, contest featured a Democratic presidential primary and a Wisconsin Supreme Court race between conservative-backed Daniel Kelly and liberal-backed Jill Karofsky, as well as numerous local elections.At his daily briefing that day, Trump connected his endorsement of Kelly to Gov. Tony Evers’ last-minute attempt to change the election. The implication was Democrats thought they’d have a better chance of boosting Karofsky by extending the election period.""(Wisconsin Democrats) didn't want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, ‘Oh, let's move the election to two months later, three.’ They didn't mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting.""So Trump is saying his endorsement caused Evers to try moving the election back two months.Let’s take a closer look at that timeline.In case you lost track of the election back-and-forth, the basics are these:Trump is claiming his endorsement of Kelly was a pivotal moment in this back-and-forth.But that’s a coincidence. Here’s why Trump is wrong.Evers’ call at that point was not to move the election by two months, but to switch the format to mail-in only and extend the deadline to May. The attempt to move the in-person election to June didn’t come until several days later.And the Evers’ administration had been moving toward that mail-in announcement well before Trump’s tweet, including calls to Republican leaders, said Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff.But there’s a much more glaring oversight from Trump.He had already endorsed Kelly several months earlier.At that time, of course, coronavirus was barely a blip on the national radar. And it was the pandemic that fueled the back-and-forth over Wisconsin’s election, not a repeat of a prior endorsement.In a statement later on Election Day, Evers said Trump was not a factor in his decision-making.""I don’t pay any attention to who the president endorses,"" the governor said. ""Frankly, my focus right now is on keeping the people of this state safe, and that’s why I issued an executive order to extend Wisconsin’s election date and make sure everyone could vote safely from home.""Trump claims his endorsement of Kelly caused the Wisconsin attempts to push the election back until June.That’s not at all how it happened.Trump had already endorsed Kelly back in January. And in any case, the action from Evers that coincidentally followed Trump’s reiterated endorsement on Twitter was to shift to a mail-in election, not to move the whole election by several months.That leaves us with a claim that is both false and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump wrong about COVID-19 testing on airplanes, trains","President Donald Trump said he was considering whether to stop domestic travel between U.S. hotspots for COVID-19.As he explained his reluctance to harm the transportation industry, Trump inaccurately said airline and train passengers were already being tested for the disease.We asked the White House for evidence and did not get a response.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it is not testing passengers at airports or train stations, a spokesperson told PolitiFact.It’s possible that Trump was referring to screening of passengers, which is happening at 13 airports for international flights. That isn’t the same as testing.Screening someone for symptoms can flag someone who could potentially have COVID-19, but it’s not as definitive as a test. It is impractical to test passengers at airports and train stations, given the slow delivery of most results and limited availability for people with symptoms.The CDC screening includes a temperature and symptoms check for travelers coming from foreign countries. Travelers returning from international travel are advised to stay home for 14 days, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.In Broward County, officials are collecting forms from passengers on certain flights from the New York tri-state area, said Greg Meyer, a spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.Representatives for airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit said passengers were not taking tests as they board or exit airplanes.""Screening may occur in airports, but testing does not,"" said Florence Brown, a spokeswoman for the airport in Philadelphia. We contacted spokespersons for multiple airlines and did not get a response. We did not hear back from Amtrak by deadline.Trump said, ""Now, they’re doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off.  They’re doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off.""Passengers on planes and trains are not being tested for COVID-19. It’s possible that Trump was referring to screenings, which could include a temperature check or a questionnaire.

I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. ""As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.""Meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem. Trump: ""Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.""Trump: ""I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people.""Trump: ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."" The President also praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position.This is ambiguous. Trump made no reference to Lutsenko by name. What he said was, ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."" Trump might have been thinking of the previous prosecutor general Viktor Shokin; that would fit more with a prosecutor who had been ""shut down."" The current prosecutor at the time, however, was Lutsenko. From the memorandum, which indicates that certain sections were left out and doesn’t name the prosecutor, we can’t tell for sure.I was told by White House officials that no other (corruption) ""cases"" were discussed.The memorandum shows that only the DNC server and the Bidens came up.I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call.Trump said that the intelligence community inspector general passed along a ""terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report."" In reality, the complaint got nearly every detail correct, as the memorandum released by the White House and the impeachment inquiry showed.It was correct on the request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the notion that Ukraine might have the DNC server that was hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election.It was correct that Trump aimed to connect the Ukrainians with Giluiani and Barr, even down to the detail of Trump mentioning the two in conjunction.The complaint described Trump as attempting to pressure Ukraine. In the impeachment inquiry, Democrats concluded that was correct, and most Republicans said it was wrong. But the key details the whistleblower offered to back that up were correct.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

This put our children in danger. Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation.""Let’s be clear up front — that is a wild exaggeration at every turn. Here’s the breakdown.The ad campaign ignores those backgrounds and focuses on the city’s lead abatement program.So let’s get back to the ad.As evidence of its multiple claims, the mailer lists four sources in footnotes:None of these prove the claims in any way.In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Hughes provided no additional direct evidence, stating simply: ""The city of Milwaukee had been requesting lead abatement audit for years. Per the current comptroller, Sawa was in charge of audit division.""That response is just as misleading as the mailer itself.Here’s the reality behind the mailer’s claims.""For three years…blocked an audit of Milwaukee lead abatement""Hughes did not respond to a question asking what three-year window this referred to.""The lead program in the city years ago was considered the example for the rest of the country, so it was considered a low-risk item,"" he said.By the time lead concerns in Milwaukee became more public, Sawa was no longer in charge of the audit division. She held that position from 2012 until February 2015, when she was promoted to accounting director, Matson said.""That was an outright lie,"" Matson, who has endorsed Sawa, said of the blocking claim.Then there’s this key detail: An audit has in fact taken place, conducted by an outside agency, and it was recently completed.""Put our children in danger""""Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation""This is flat-out ridiculous. The criminal investigation connected to the lead testing is of the health department, not the comptroller’s office.The investigation came after former health commissioner Bevan Baker was forced from his job in January 2018, and a number of other staffers were disciplined, forced to resign or fired.There was never a criminal probe into Sawa or the comptroller’s office.The actual audit involved has yet to be released to the public, though Matson said a copy of the findings have been submitted to the city. In January 2018, the Common Council directed the city clerk to audit all Health Department programs within 90 days, as lead concerns grew. Matson said he objected at the time, arguing this was both not humanly possible and that only a few organizations around the country were qualified to audit a lead abatement program, so the council rescinded the request and asked the comptroller’s office to seek an outside audit.A flier attacking Sawa says she ""blocked an audit"" of the city’s lead abatement program for three years that ""put our children in danger"" and spurred a criminal investigation.But Sawa’s oversight of city audits ended in 2015, well before any concerns with the city’s lead testing program publicly came to light. And in any case, there was never any suggested or proposed audit brought forward that she could block.Implying she continued blocking something for a three-year span is pure fiction — as is the claim that her actions spurred a criminal investigation. The investigation was of the health department, not Sawa or the comptroller’s office.And, of course, an audit has in fact been done.We rate this false and ridiculous claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Reporter was right: Trump did question governors’ ventilator requests,"President Donald Trump argued with ""PBS NewsHour"" reporter Yamiche Alcindor over what the president had said, or hadn’t said, about New York’s need for ventilators.Ventilators are a type of medical equipment considered vital for saving the lives of patients hit hardest by the virus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made urgent calls for more ventilators to cope with a rising number of hospitalizations in his state due to coronavirus.The exchange continued, with Trump at one point telling Alcindor, ""Be nice. Don’t be threatening."" He later cut her off before she was able to ask her second question, although another reporter subsequently handed her the microphone so that she could ask it.Here, we’ll look at the substance of the dispute between Trump and Alcindor. Which of them was right about what he said during a March 26 phone interview on Hannity’s show on Fox News? Alcindor was.Here’s the first:""Gov. Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them (ventilators). 30,000! All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers.""Later, Hannity picked up on this theme. Hannity said he was ""kind of angry at Andrew Cuomo. I had a great — I had him on radio for 40 minutes, great conversation. I grew up in — I was born and raised in New York. And then it's, ‘I need 30,000 ventilators.’ And I'm like OK, it really — it was annoying me.""Trump subsequently echoed this sentiment.""New York is a bigger deal. But it's going to go also. But I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?""So, contrary to Trump’s repeated denials during the press conference, this passage clearly shows that the president told Hannity that he feels the numbers of ventilators being requested by governors, including Cuomo, are higher than what’s needed.Trump told Alcindor that ""I didn’t say that"" some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need.That’s directly refuted by Trump’s comments during Hannity’s show, in which he said, ""I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be.

As prosecutor, Karofsky even went easy on criminal predators, like no jail time for a monster who sexually assaulted a 5-year-old girl.""In both ads, on-screen text notes the case in question is that of Donald A. Worley.But a closer look at the case file reveals a major oversight in the ad.Here’s what we found.The Madison man, then 26, was charged in February 1999 with child enticement and first-degree sexual assault of a child — serious felonies that carried decades of potential prison time.Those online records list Karofsky as the prosecutor, which is what both groups pointed to when asked for evidence backing the ad.But they missed a critical detail: online court records list only the most recent prosecutor. Many district attorneys' offices have different prosecutors handle hearings over the course of a given case, and that’s what happened here.The prosecution’s file from Worley’s case, provided by Karofsky’s team, details which prosecutor handled different elements of the case.The prosecuting attorney for each appearance initials the file, and Dan Martin’s initials are listed alongside appearances from the preliminary hearing in February 1999 to the request to close the case in March 2000 following the sentencing hearing.So Martin — not Karofsky — was at the controls when the plea deal was made.The file shows Karofsky didn’t touch the case until more than a year after the plea agreement and sentencing. She represented the office for a motion hearing in July 2001, where the state requested that Worley not be allowed to remain in his family residence.Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne confirmed the accuracy of the case file record in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.Karofksy’s campaign issued a news release March 27, 2020, demanding the ads be taken down, and noting a cease-and-desist letter would be issued.A pair of attack ads say Karofsky was ""soft"" as a prosecutor because she allowed Worley to get away with no jail time.But Karofsky didn’t touch the case until more than a year after the plea agreement reducing the charges and the sentencing imposing no jail time. The ad is based on sloppy research that misunderstood the meaning of the online case records.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

But it offers zero proof for that claim or the headline reference to the governor ""pushing firearm confiscation orders.""But there’s a huge difference between red flag laws and the widespread gun seizures implied by this headline.Red flag laws provide a mechanism — with a judge’s approval — to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others.Under Evers’ proposal, a law enforcement officer, family member or household member could petition a judge to intervene if they believe an individual is a danger to self or others. The judge then could issue a preliminary order good for up to 14 days, during which the guns could be taken away. A judge would then schedule a full hearing, where the gun owner could present his or her case and the judge could issue a final order valid for up to one year.A year-old story now circulating again on Facebook says Evers is ""pushing firearm confiscation orders.""That was an overreach in 2019, and it’s even more absurd now.The article was referring to red flag laws, but at the time of this post Evers hadn’t proposed one yet.

PANTS-FIRE,Was the novel coronavirus really sneaky in its spread to the U.S.? Experts say no,"Unveiling a series of policies meant to mitigate the threat of COVID-19, President Donald Trump also sought to respond to criticisms that his administration has been slow to deal with what is now a worldwide pandemic.In particular, the president defended his administration on the issue of insufficient testing resources and what experts say is a looming shortage of medical equipment and personnel.His argument? No one saw this coming.""It snuck up on us,"" Trump said at a March 18 media briefing. Later, he added that the virus is ""a very unforeseen thing.""Trump has repeated that idea a lot lately. But the claim doesn’t square with the evidence.We contacted the White House, which declined to comment on the record. Meanwhile, independent experts told us this claim is deeply misleading.Both in Washington and internationally, health officials had been warning about the dangers posed by COVID-19 since at least January, with some early signals going back as far as December when the illness emerged in the Wuhan province of China. Those warnings continued into February, well before the White House began taking serious steps to increase testing and treatment efforts – a delay that experts said has significantly undermined the national response.""The alarm was sounded in January,"" said Jennifer Kates, a global health expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""This wasn’t a surprise."" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)At that point, researchers told us, decisive and widespread federal action could have made a big difference.But publicly, Trump was still comparing the virus to the flu, downplaying the risk on Twitter and television, and declaring repeatedly that the virus was under control.And of course, the coronavirus warnings didn’t just come from Washington.In doing so, ""we were alerting all countries of very real threat of international spread,"" said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson.The weeks-long gaps between those warnings and federal efforts to actually test for coronavirus, and to treat it, matter greatly, Kates said.""It was very visible what was happening and what measures we should be taking,"" she told us.Had the White House acted earlier, in particular by stepping up efforts to test for the virus and isolate cases immediately, the virus may not have spread as quickly, global health experts said. The ongoing efforts to ""socially distance"" even people without symptoms – which have large economic and health downsides, are less effective and less enforceable, researchers told us – wouldn’t be as necessary as they are now.""Delays of days here matter. When we start throwing away weeks, we really change what’s possible,"" said Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University. ""If we had done a little more of anything, we would find ourselves in a better situation than where we are right now.""Meanwhile, people in public health and national security had been warning for years about a looming pandemic – and noting that the United States wasn’t adequately prepared for the devastation it could wreak on both citizens’ health and the economy.The only details missing were what pandemic and when precisely it would strike.""Public health experts have been shouting that a major pandemic is likely and, in fact, is the greatest security threat we face,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University who studies public health law.As for claims that something like COVID-19 ""snuck up on us"" or was ""very unforeseen""?""It is simply astonishing and simply untrue,"" he said.Researchers pointed us to countless reports – including some by government officials – that highlighted the threat of a pandemic.In May 2018, researchers at Johns Hopkins University put out a paper warning that respiratory viruses posed a ""global catastrophic biological risk."" In particular, the researchers warned about RNA viruses -- viruses made up of the traditionally single-stranded ribonucleic acid, and also cause illnesses such as the common cold, influenza, hepatitis C and polio.Their warning wasn’t off: COVID-19 is indeed a respiratory illness caused by an RNA virus, from the same specific viral family -- that is, the coronavirus family -- as SARS and MERS.""Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global—a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,"" read the event description.""We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,"" reads the report.In fact, the report suggested animal-to-human transmission as a source for the next major pandemic – which, experts say, is in fact how COVID-19 emerged.""Many people saw this coming, although, of course, it was not known exactly when,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.Put another way: Experts have been talking about the need for pandemic preparedness, Mores recalled, for at least as long as he has been studying global health. He’s been in the field for 25 years.President Donald Trump said COVID-19 ""snuck up on us,"" and was ""a very unforeseen thing.""In fact, the president heard warnings about this specific virus from his advisers and the global health community for months. And public health and national security experts had been highlighting the risks for even longer about the threat of some kind of pandemic – even if the details weren’t yet known.Indeed, it is because of Trump’s slow response to the pandemic that ""social distancing"" is now required at such a large-scale level. Earlier, more focused testing and sequestering of people with the virus could have mitigated some of the response now required, experts told us.Trump’s claim is incorrect, and in fact flies in the face of years’ worth of evidence.

Current supply of the test is limited, and it is clinicians who decide whether a patient meets criteria to warrant testing. Testing is not as easy as just calling your doctor or pharmacy, saying you want to be tested for COVID-19 and getting it done.""Unfortunately, it’s not that simple yet,"" said Christopher Mores, a professor of global health at George Washington University.There is greater availability of tests, but the number of labs involved in the testing process is still limited, Mores said. Testing is expected to increase as more commercial labs participate, but even they have limits in the number of patients that can be tested daily, Mores said.PolitiFact found news reports of people who wanted to get tested and couldn’t, or of hindrances in the testing process. Here’s a sample:""They will decide whether you need to be tested, but keep in mind that there is no treatment for COVID-19, and people who are mildly ill are able to isolate at home,"" the federal health agency said.The CDC is typically the first one to develop a diagnostic test because they have access before others to clinical specimens and viral samples. The CDC test then becomes the basis for tests developed by others. But there were manufacturing problems with the CDC test at first.Trump administration officials have provided conflicting information regarding how many people can be tested. Stephen M. Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, acknowledged the confusion on March 7.The CDC has shipped tests to public health laboratories to test about 75,000 people, Hahn said. Additionally, 1.1 million tests were shipped to nonpublic health labs, and around 1 million more tests were close to being shipped, he said.But the number of tests shipped doesn’t equal the number of people that can be tested. For instance, 2.1 million tests would roughly translate to testing for 850,000 Americans, according to Hahn.Manufacturers plan to scale up production so they can ship 4 million more tests by mid March, Hahn said, and large commercial and academic labs are also expected to make more tests.Trump said, ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test.""This is wrong. It is health care providers who make the call on who gets tested, based on recommendations from the CDC. There’s an increase in the number of tests being manufactured, but an increase in the availability of tests does not mean that ""anybody that wants a test can get a test."" Trump’s statement is inaccurate and a gross oversimplification of the facts.

PANTS-FIRE,Joe Biden’s Pants on Fire claim about his arrest in South Africa,"An unsubstantiated story told by former Vice President Joe Biden about getting arrested while trying to see Nelson Mandela inspired a wave of fact-checking, a pointed interview on Fox News about his inability to get the facts right, and a skit on Saturday Night Live.The actual version of the story Biden told didn’t go exactly that way. But reviews by journalists have found it similarly unsupported by facts.""This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island."" (It’s actually Robben Island.)In the language of PolitiFact, it was a Pants on Fire story. We contacted Biden’s campaign to ask about his initial claims that he was arrested, and the later accounts in which he said he was stopped, and did not get a reply. ""When I exited the plane I was directed to one side of the tarmac, while the African American congressmen traveling with me were sent to the other side,"" said the written statement. ""I refused to break off, and the officials finally relented.""When we interviewed Young on March 4, he said neither one of them was arrested in South Africa.""I wouldn’t say we were arrested,"" he said. Young told PolitiFact that he was arrested twice in his life — once in Atlanta and once in Savannah. He said that it often happens that when people recount stories about civil rights decades ago, they have memories that result in conflicting stories. ""I get this all time, (people say) ‘I went to jail with you in Birmingham.’ I say, no, you didn’t go to jail with me in Birmingham. I didn’t go to jail in Birmingham,"" he said.Young, who said he visited South Africa multiple times in the 1970s, did recall traveling with Biden to South Africa. Young said that either South African police or the military would not allow the congressmen to get back to their plane at the airport and detained them briefly behind a chained fence before letting them through to their airplane. Young recalled U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York arguing with authorities.The South African authorities ""were used to black people bowing heads and being humble, and Charlie Rangel was anything but humble,"" Young said.Young said he considers Biden a longtime friend and would love to see him as president, although he told PolitiFact he hasn’t endorsed him. By late February, Biden and his campaign had changed his story.Biden said when he exited the plane with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, officials tried to separate him from the African American congressmen.""They had me get off a plane — the Afrikaners got on in the short pants and their guns. Let me off first and moved me in a direction totally different. I turned around and everybody, the entire black delegation, was going another way. I said, 'I'm not going to go in that door that says white only. I'm going with them.' They said, 'You're not, you can't move, you can't go with them.' And they kept me there until finally I decided that it was clear I wasn't going to move,"" Biden said.The officials then took the members of Congress through a baggage claim area to a restaurant. ""When I said ‘arrested,’ I meant I was not able, I was not able to move, cops, Afrikaners would let me go with them, made me stay where I was. I guess I wasn't arrested, I was stopped. I was not able to move where I wanted to go.""He continued:""They said, no, you can't. And I said, I'm staying here, I'm not going to move. And they would not let me move anywhere, so I guess I should have said, I was detained, I was not able to move forward.  So what they finally did was they went out, and they cleared out a baggage claim area, took us all up through the baggage claim area, up through a restaurant.""One other part of Biden’s story doesn’t match up. He said that he was arrested on the streets of Soweto trying to see Mandela at Robben Island. Soweto is a neighborhood in Johannesburg. Robben Island is more than 700 miles away off the coast of Cape Town. Biden said, ""I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see (Nelson Mandela) on Robbens Island.""There is no evidence to prove that Biden was arrested in South Africa in the 1970s while trying to visit Mandela. Biden has since walked back his remarks to say that when he exited the airplane, officials tried to separate him from African American congressmen or detained him.This statement rates Pants on Fire. "

Joe Biden won’t represent us, defend us or help us. Don’t believe Biden’s empty promises.""We’ve seen this quote from Obama before.

In his book ""Dreams from my Father,"" Obama was describing a conversation with a Chicago barber who remembered African Americans helping elect Chicago’s first black mayor. The ad creates an impression that Obama was describing the failure of Democrats, including Biden, to actually help blacks, while in reality, the passage was about a key African American election victory.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Sanfelippo flops with claim on violent crime,"One Assembly Republican making the case for a series of tough-on-crime bills says a statewide rise in violent crime shows why the bills are needed.""FBI data shows violent crime rates increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017,"" said Sanfelippo. ""In fact, when combining Wisconsin’s 10 largest cities, the violent crime rate increased by 24% during that time, while decreasing by 14% on a national average.""It’s certainly an eye-catching claim. Is violent crime up in all but two of the hundreds of cities across Wisconsin?We checked it out — and found a case study in how not to use data. Sanfelippo misquoted the stat he was trying to use while constructing an argument riddled with other data-related problems.Let’s see what the data actually tells us.Amid a discussion of police spending and staffing, the paper used FBI data to say violent crime had risen in Wisconsin from 2008 to 2017. The FBI gathers crime stats from departments around the country, and reports a ""violent crime"" tally based on the number of homicides, sexual assaults, robberies and aggravated assaults.Sanfelippo and the paper point to 2017 data. But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,  shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases.The number of violent crimes Wisconsin law enforcement reported to the FBI fell from 15,931 in 2017 to 15,263 in 2018.But that’s not necessarily a reliable number. Here’s why.The FBI crime data is difficult to compare year-to-year because it’s not comprehensive.Not every police department reports their data every year. And state and local officials regularly change their reporting practices, changing definitions or other factors in generating counts.To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now ""not comparable to previous years’ data.""This was not taken into account in Sanfelippo’s claim or the memo his office cited as backup.In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years. That included three of the 10 largest cities — which you’ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime.We’ll also note that while Sanfelippo referred to cities, the FBI data includes cities, towns and villages, so we’ll refer to the group as municipalities here.More than two-thirds of the violent crimes in Wisconsin take place in Milwaukee, so in large part the statewide trend is just a reflection of what’s happening in the state’s largest city.Addressing these three data issues (age, comparability and the Milwaukee outlier) lets us bring the state’s actual violent crime trend into clearer focus. And we find there essentially is no trend.Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities — still a solid sample size. Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018.But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change.Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 — virtually unchanged.But all of these data mistakes pale in comparison to Sanfelippo’s dramatic misuse of the memo’s description.The memo said — again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing — that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state’s 10 largest cities.Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in ""all but two Wisconsin cities.""That’s not even close to true.Using the 206 municipalities referenced above — those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven’t changed reporting practices — we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20.Sanfelippo acknowledged using the stat incorrectly when questioned by PolitiFact Wisconsin. The reference, which was wrong in both the recorded and written versions of the radio address, came from a script that Sanfelippo said wasn’t written by him or his office.""It wasn’t intentionally done, it was just a mistake,"" he said. ""I should have picked up on that for as much as I have been talking about crime these last few months.""Arguing for a series of tough-on-crime bills, Sanfelippo said in a statewide radio address that violent crime ""increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017.""Almost every word of that is wrong.Any comparison should have factored in the 2018 data, which was available at the time. The comparisons shouldn’t include the many places where reporting practices changed. And even the use of the word cities is wrong since the dataset includes towns and villages.Most importantly, Sanfelippo misstated the claim he was trying to repeat. In actuality, there are more than 100 Wisconsin municipalities where the crime rate did not rise — more than half the communities included in the best available FBI data.That makes Sanfelippo’s claim not only false, but ridiculous. We rate this Pants on Fire."

""""What evidence does New Jersey have that this person who is running for president is who he is?"" Apuzzo said, according to an April 10, 2012, story in the Home News Tribune, a daily paper serving Middlesex County. . Presiding at the hearing, Judge Jeff Masin indicated how he would rule in the case, according to the Tribune, by saying that past court rulings determined that children who are born in the United States but have parents who are not from the United States are considered natural-born citizens. Masin said he would consider whether Hawaii-born Obama, whose father was not from the United States, needed to do more to prove to the state’s elections division that he qualifies to run for president. But he forwarned he would not be considering the authenticity of the birth certificate the president posted online as he made his decision.The Obama campaign sent a lawyer, Alexandra Hill, to that hearing. Describing Hill’s statements during that hearing, conservative columnist Diana West wrote later that month that Hill ""couldn’t have been more adamant about not citing the online birth certificate as a means of proving the president’s identity in this recent challenge.""""Indeed, she called the Internet image ‘legally irrelevant,’"" West wrote, ""arguing that New Jersey law doesn’t specifically call for a birth certificate to quality a presidential candidate for the ballot.""We rate this story Pants on Fire!"

Davis took issue with his request. The two exchanged heated words as Davis sat in the back seat of the SUV.Dunn argued that he thought he saw the barrel of a gun inside the car and was in fear for his life when he shot up the SUV. The prosecution said that the threat Dunn, a white man, perceived from the group of black teens was ""only in his imagination.""

PANTS-FIRE,Are wolves partly to blame for the dairy crisis? No. Tiffany misses the mark.,"State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a candidate for Wisconsin’s open 7th U.S. Congressional District seat, has a theory about what’s causing dairy farmers to struggle throughout Wisconsin: the growing wolf population. The district, which covers northwest Wisconsin, is open after Republican Sean Duffy stepped down in September 2019. The primary is Feb. 18, and the special election will be held May 12. During a Dec. 12, 2019, Republican debate, a panelist asked Tiffany and his primary opponent, Army veteran Jason Church, about economic growth in the state, specifically about what the candidates would do to combat the rising popularity of socialism. In response, Tiffany spoke about ""socialistic things"" that happen in the federal government, among them the decision to keep wolves on the endangered species list: ""We should be able to manage the wolf population here in Wisconsin, by our own state rather than the federal government. What happens as a result of the federal government managing it? Our farmers, their cattle get harmed by it. They're attacked, livestock. Their cattle get harassed, less production. It harms their businesses. And we're wondering why farms are going out of business in Wisconsin?"" In other words, wolves play a key role in the struggles of dairy farms across the state. In 2019, more than 800 dairy farms in Wisconsin -- many of them small, family-run operations -- closed amid a deep downturn in milk prices and other factors. Is Tiffany right? Wolves have long been a problem for farmers When we asked Tiffany’s campaign team for backup, his staff said the information came from Tiffany’s own upbringing on a dairy farm, and seeing the effect of stress on cows. The stress of predation by wolves can cause cows to lose pregnancies, lower milk production and lead to  smaller weight gains, said Mattias Gugel, Tiffany’s communications director.The state’s gray wolves were granted protection in 1974 under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits the killing of any protected animal. One measure of damage from wolves is a state program that reimburses farmers for losses from verified wolf killings.From that perspective, the impact of killed or injured livestock is tiny. The effects of wolves beyond just predation are hard to tellOther effects could include stillbirths from stress and decreased weight gain from increased vigilance, but those results were hypothetical, and unable to be properly proven without a different study, said Adrian Wydeven, one of the researchers who worked on the DNR study and a certified wildlife biologist.""Producers may suspect and have lower rates of pregnancy and lower weights, but unless you can eliminate all other factors, it’s hard to attribute some of these non-lethal impacts on livestock,"" Wydeven said. He also pointed out that most studies on wolf and cattle interactions focus on beef livestock, because dairy farms often have more people moving around, and the cows are brought in several times a day for milking. That can discourage wolves in the area.Adrian Treves, a professor with the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said dairy cattle are less affected by wolves than by other elements of their environment. ""The hypothesis of body weight loss in domestic animals exposed to wolves, as Mr. Tiffany is suggesting, has little solid evidence worldwide although it has been mentioned for decades,"" Treves wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Considering the vastly more costly and concerning losses of farm animals to weather and disease, Wisconsin’s family farmers would benefit from attention to more important issues."" Other factors at playAmong them: The long-running decline in milk consumption, the drop in milk prices paid to farmers, increased global competition and the struggle to maintain leadership in the industry, as well as more recently, the impact of tariffs and trade wars. What’s more, the number of wolves in the state started to skyrocket in the early 2000s. During that time, milk production grew steadily and continues to grow -- which itself is a factor in lower prices. That, too, undermines the impact Tiffany places on wolves.Mark Stephenson, director of the Center for Dairy Profitability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that wolves haven’t come up as a factor in his conversations with milk producers. ""That isn’t to say that there aren’t a few farms on the edge of our wilder areas of the state where this could be an issue, but it certainly isn’t a major issue for the greater dairy industry in the state,"" he wrote. ""It is more likely to impact grazing farms on the edge of large woodland tracks, and we don’t have a significant portion of our dairy industry under those conditions."" Our rulingTiffany claimed federal regulation of the wolf population has led to attacks on livestock, driving down production, leading to dairy farms going out of business. But the number of cows killed by wolves is tiny in comparison to the size of the state’s dairy industry, which has been battered by years of low milk prices, declining consumption and a host of global economic factors. What’s more, the rise in the wolf population came amid a period of growing milk production. And it’s that over supply that is helping drive down prices. Our definition for Pants on Fire is ""the statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."" That fits here."
PANTS-FIRE,"Trump’s claim that he ‘saved’ pre-ex conditions ‘part fantasy, part delusion’","President Donald Trump attempted to take credit for one of the most popular elements of the Affordable Care Act: Its protection for people who have preexisting medical conditions.The  protection for people with medical problems has been a rallying cry for Democrats, and they used the issue to help propel their widespread election victories in 2018.Trump’s recent claim that he ""saved"" that guarantee of coverage adds a new twist, though. We contacted the White House to find out the basis for this statement.Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, told us, ""President Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to protect individuals with preexisting conditions and his track record shows that he has consistently done what is necessary to improve care for the vulnerable."" Deere also pointed us to a range of other policy initiatives – such as efforts on kidney health, approving generic drugs and loosening restrictions on short-term health plans.But none of those addressed the basis of Trump’s tweet.The health policy experts we consulted, however, were unambiguous: The president’s claim has no factual basis and flies in the face of his ongoing policy efforts.""I feel like we’re being gas-lit,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute. ""You can’t tell me you’re the savior of people with preexisting conditions when every single thing you’ve said or done is the opposite of that."" (Gaslighting means manipulating the telling of events in such a way it leads people to question their recollections.)This skepticism persisted across the political spectrum.""That’s a rather extended version of aspirational rhetoric short of any evidence,"" said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.The preexisting condition protectionUnder the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, health insurance plans cannot charge people higher prices because they have a medical condition. This protection has been intact since the law took effect, under then-President Barack Obama.""That tweet is part fantasy, part delusion, part politics, and all lie,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""The president is lying about preexisting conditions. He supported, and continues to support, efforts to repeal the ACA that would take those consumer protections away.""After that effort, Blumberg said, the president boasted that he had dismantled Obamacare – which is not only untrue, but, she added, confused many consumers.Since then, the president has maintained his desire to undo the ACA and replace it with something new.Neither his administration nor congressional Republicans have yet offered a replacement plan. None of the bills they have endorsed would maintain the guarantees of coverage for people with medical problems.""By supporting repeal of the ACA, they’re supporting repeal of protecting preexisting condition prohibitions,"" Robert Berenson, another analyst at the Urban Institute, previously told us.Texas v. AzarMeanwhile, the Trump administration’s work elsewhere could undo the  protection.A group of Republican-led states are suing to have the entire ACA dismantled. Their argument stems from a law Trump signed: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.That law gutted the individual mandate – the ACA’s requirement that everyone have coverage or pay a penalty – by reducing the penalty to $0.Miller argued that the still-pending court case and previous repeal efforts don’t necessarily mean there’s any imminent threat of the president gutting the ACA’s preexisting condition protections.""For pure public opinion purposes, you want to say you’re protecting against preexisting condition protections,"" Miller said. ""Does he know how to do it? No. Is he doing anything trying to change it? Not really.""But others noted that the administration’s stance is firmly against maintaining the ACA’s prohibitions.""The Democrats have correctly said the Trump administration has in fact opposed protections for preexisting conditions by endorsing the lawsuit,"" Berenson said.Our rulingTrump tweeted that he ""was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your healthcare.""The president had nothing to do with the ban on health insurance plans discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. This consumer protection is a core part of the health care law that became law during the Obama presidency. Trump has expressly supported the repeal of this law without offering a replacement that would keep the protection intact.  And to this day, his administration is arguing in court that the law – including this provision – should be undone.The president’s tweet is not only untrue, but it misrepresents his administration’s efforts to repeal the health care law without offering any replacement that might maintain its core protections.

""You are not hearing any of the Gulf members, you are not hearing China, you are not hearing Russia. The only ones that are mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates.""But Haley is wrong in counting top Democrats among the mourners of Soleimani. The five Democrats who have qualified so far for the Jan. 14 debate in Iowa — Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar — all expressed concern about the potential for Trump’s strike on Soleimani to escalate tensions and prompt a rush for war. However, four of the five prefaced their comments by saying that Soleimani was a dangerous man with blood on his hands. None had anything close to praise for him or sympathy for his death.Here are some of the statements by these Democrats: Biden said Trump owes Americans an explanation of his strategy and how he plans to keep troops safe. ""I hope the administration has thought through the second- and third-order consequences of the paths they have chosen,"" Biden wrote.Several other Democratic presidential candidates also made a point of criticizing Soleimani. Top congressional Democrats echoed the critiques offered by the presidential candidates.A response from Haley’s spokesman included such a broad interpretation of the word ""mourning"" to render its definition meaningless, saying Democrats are ""effectively"" mourning Soleimani by questioning whether the United States is better off after his killing.Haley said the Democratic leadership and presidential candidates ""are mourning the loss of Soleimani.""That’s a complete fabrication. Most of the top congressional Democrats and the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have gone out of their way to say that Soleimani was a bad actor who is responsible for many deaths, including deaths of Americans. The few top Democrats who didn’t go out of their way to say something along those lines simply ignored him in their statements.Haley’s statement is ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Nancy Pelosi claims 200K “will be prohibited from voting” in Wisconsin. That's wrong.,"Up to 234,000 Wisconsin residents are at risk of being removed from the voter rolls, a political lightning-rod that has drawn national attention given the state’s critical role in the 2020 presidential election.Wisconsin election officials believe those people may have moved, so they sent letters inquiring about their status in October. A series of ensuing lawsuits and court actions have sought to more quickly remove these people from the voting rolls -- or delay that from happening.A Twitter account described as Pelosi’s ""political account"" retweeted a statement from Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler and then offered its own take on the situation.There’s clearly room for disagreement over how to handle the 234,000 voters.But Pelosi’s claim is a significant exaggeration of what’s at stake.Here’s why.The backgroundThe letters asked recipients to re-register at their new address if they had moved or to confirm they were still at their same address if they hadn't.Voting roll cleanup in WisconsinMap shows the distribution by county of letters sent by the Wisconsin Elections Commission in an effort to clean up Wisconsin voter rolls. About 55% of mailers were sent to municipalities that supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. (Letters sent to municipalities that bridge multiple counties were counted in the county where most of the population lives)State officials want to put off forcing people off the rolls until 2021, not wanting to affect the 2020 election since they aren’t certain all of those people actually moved.Indeed, as of Dec. 5, 2019, the Elections Commission said 2,300 recipients had responded to the letter to report they still lived at the same address. By that point, 16,500 recipients had also registered to vote at new addresses, and 60,000 letters had been returned as undeliverable.But a lawsuit brought in November by three voters with the help of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty argued election officials were required to remove voters from the rolls 30 days after sending the letters if they hadn't heard from them.Four days later, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed notice the state would appeal and seek to stay the judge’s ruling. The same day, the left-leaning League of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed suit in federal court to try to stop voter names from being purged.So what happens to the 234,000 voters?The claim by Pelosi, via her Twitter account, is that they will be ""prohibited"" from voting. Addressing this at the polls would mean filling out paperwork and providing proof of residence such as a driver's license, property tax bill, utility bill, bank statement, paycheck stub, lease or workplace ID. That means some people — we have no idea how many — could be unable to vote if they can’t provide proof of residence at the polls and don’t re-register beforehand.The Pelosi tweet was made in the context of the 2020 election, but the next chance for Wisconsin residents to vote is the spring primary on Feb. 18, 2020. So it does leave a narrow window to get reregistered before the election.That said, the 234,000 people who received the letter are not prohibited from voting.""This mailing is designed to help people who may have moved within Wisconsin make sure they’re ready to vote next year,""  said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief elections official. ""It will not keep anyone eligible from voting."" When asked for evidence supporting the tweet, a Pelosi spokesman acknowledged the ability to re-register but largely reiterated the same overstated claim.""Of course, if people re-register, they will be able to vote,"" said Jorge Aguilar. ""If the purge goes through, people will be de-registered and not be allowed to vote.""Weighing in on the Wisconsin voter rolls controversy, Pelosi says these 200,000-plus people ""will be prohibited from voting.""That’s a major overstatement of how this actually works.Yes, the pruning process — if allowed by the courts — could potentially remove more than 200,000 people from the voting rolls before the upcoming elections. But there is no punitive element that would ban future voting. Everyone can re-register, even on Election Day.The use of the word ""prohibited,"" in particular, goes too far, in that it suggests there is no way to vote in the future.We rate Pelosi’s claim Pants on Fire."

Bush and the GLO intend on moving the Cenotaph outside the boundaries of the Alamo; they also intend to erect a statue of the dictator Santa Anna and a memorial honoring the Mexican Army!"" Range wrote. ""I am not making this up. We know that parts of the Bush plan were going to be horrendous, but it now looks like it will be worse than we ever dreamed.""But there are no plans to build a monument to Santa Anna and the Mexican Army at the Alamo.Bush shared a series of tweets on Thursday rebutting the allegations in the post and suggesting that the claim has racist roots.Here are his tweets, presented together:""One must ask themselves, why am I being accused of honoring the murderous dictator Santa Anna?"" Bush wrote. "" Is it because my mother (now a naturalized citizen) is from Mexico? I was born in Houston, my wife is from San Angelo, and my boys were born-you guessed it- here in Texas.""As a United States Navy Veteran, who deployed to Afghanistan, I know exactly what it means to be loyal to the American flag, this country and this great state.

""If you’re going to honor somebody, that is a statue or a memorial or a monument.

""They didn’t want people seeing it.""David McElroy, the studio manager of TVSA, the public access channel that airs government meetings in San Antonio, said that footage of the Dec. 4 meeting was not edited.The city uses a vendor that indexes and uploads footage from public meetings to the city’s website.

PANTS-FIRE,Is Jim Justice the first West Virginia governor to fight for teacher pay raises?,"West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, facing a competitive Republican primary in 2020, recently introduced an ad touting his accomplishments in office, including a focus on K-12 education.This struck us as odd, since governors of all parties regularly tout their support for teachers — a group that’s popular with voters and, in many states, a politically powerful constituency.So is Justice really the first West Virginia governor ever to push for teacher pay raises? His office did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we found that each of Justice’s five immediate predecessors either proposed or enacted teacher pay raises.The legislation Manchin signed also improved teachers’ annual salary increments and allowed educators to move from a 401(k)-style defined contribution plans to a defined-benefit system.Justice’s ad said he’s ""the first West Virginia governor to fight for pay raises for educators.""That’s far off-base. Seeking pay raises for teachers is practically a rite of passage for governors, and West Virginia is no exception.

They said nothing about Schiff. Many conservative websites have been carrying this story, and, from what we see, the connection to Schiff stems solely from his holdings managed by the two fund management firms. One America News said that Schiff is ""under investigation for Ukrainian Bursima oil connections.""The notion that Schiff has ""connections"" to Burisma oil stems from a news conference held by two Ukrainian lawmakers, who actually never mentioned Schiff or presented official documents.

Before Ukraine, she was the ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, both times appointed by President George W. Bush. She worked under six administrations, two of them Democratic and four Republican. Earlier in the Bush years, she was deputy chief of mission of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.When Yovanovitch was nominated as ambassador to Armenia in 2008, former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, a Republican, testified that she was ""highly qualified"" and would do an outstanding job.He testified that he had seen her work as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, and that the president of Kyrgyzstan told him ""what a great job she had been doing and how she'd worked out some of the problems that they had with America.""""She's made a very serious contribution to our national interest in securing our Air Force base and establishing a constructive relationship with the government after what they called the Tulip Revolution in 2005,"" he said.During the 2008 hearing, Yovanovitch faced some criticism when she didn’t use the word ""genocide"" when talking about the mass killings in Armenia. The previous ambassador was withdrawn after he used the ""genocide"" term, which was against U.S. policy.Trump tweeted, ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad"" and then referenced Somalia and Ukraine.The White House failed to provide evidence that Yovanovitch was to blame for what happened in Somalia during her tenure. She was stationed in Somalia early in her career in the 1980s. There is no evidence that as an embassy official she played any role in Somalia’s downfall. People also spoke highly of her time in Ukraine, and we were able to find no hard evidence to suggest her Ukraine tenure was ""bad."" In fact, we found many positive words about her job performance.We rate this statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Pro-Trump Facebook ad takes text in Obama’s book wildly out of context,"A Facebook ad by a PAC supporting President Donald Trump distorts a statement in a book by President Barack Obama about African American voters. ""Democrats promised to help our community,"" the narrator says. ""Promises they never kept."" The ad then pivots to Obama:""Here is President Obama: 'Plantation politics. black people in the worst jobs, the worst housing, police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we’d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.' ""The narrator then continues: ""Enough empty promises. President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered. Democrats don’t care about us.""The ad takes words from a book by Obama where he was talking from the perspective of someone else. It takes those words out of context and gives them a meaning they didn’t have. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington.Here’s how the scene plays in the book:""Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,"" Smitty said. ""Before Harold, seemed like we’d always be second-class citizens.""""Plantation politics,"" the man with the newspaper said.""That’s just what it was, too,"" Smitty said. ""A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we’d reward ‘em with the vote.""In his book, Obama then described the power of African Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified.Obama wrote: ""They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded.""In Smitty’s words, ""The night Harold won, let me tell you, people just ran the streets,…."" he said, recounting how the community was proud of Washington and themselves. ""When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life.""The pro-Trump ad uses the passage to create the impression that Obama believed that black voters, ignored and suffering, sold their soul to the Democrats at election time. But the actual book passage is about the good things that come from voting.Chad Banghart, the executive director of the PAC, told us that he thinks it is clear that the ad is Obama reading from his book. However, the ad never states the context of Obama’s words. Banghart also suggested that Smitty the barber was a fictional creation. A pro-Trump Facebook ad says that Obama said black people have the ""worst jobs, the worst housing"" and face rampant police brutality, ""but when so-called black committeemen came around election time we’d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.""While Obama did say those words, they were not his own. In his book ""Dreams from my Father,"" Obama was describing a conversation with a Chicago barber who remembered African Americans helping elect Chicago’s first black mayor. The ad creates an impression that Obama said that Democrats ignored the perils faced by black voters and then black voters turned around and automatically voted for them anyway. In reality, a Chicago barber told Obama that, but then said the Chicago mayor’s race showed that turning out to vote can make a difference.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Trump ‘dead wrong’ about the change in murders in Chicago,"During his first visit to Chicago since taking office, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his favorite targets: the city’s violence.Nationally, murders have not decreased by quite as much as the president said. What’s more, his Chicago comparison is contradicted by city and federal data. Not only has Chicago seen murders fall by significantly more than 10% in recent years, its decline is rivaled by few other large cities.Press officers at the White House did not respond to our request for comment.Those figures, which are reported by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, show Trump missed the mark on multiple counts.First, the number of murders reported nationwide for 2018 was 6.9% lower than it was in 2016 — not more than 10%, as he claimed.Second, the declines experienced by Chicago during the same period — from 765 murders to 563 — were larger than those seen in all but three of the nation’s 30 largest cities: San Antonio, San Diego and San Jose.That marked decline is also something Johnson turned to in defense when responding to Trump’s attack.Ames Grawert, who leads the quantitative research team at the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, said that although Chicago’s per capita murder rate is still more than four times higher than the national average, the city has made considerable progress in recent years — something Trump’s comments ignore.""He’s dead wrong on Chicago,"" Grawert said. ""The city’s gotten a lot safer in the past two years and it’s not right to say Chicago’s lagging the national trend … It’s one of the cities that’s led the downward trend of the last two years.""Referring to Chicago, Trump said that ""over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America’s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%.""Chicago has seen a nearly 30% decrease in murders over the past several years. That well outpaces the national decline of just under 7%. Rather than holding the nation back, as Trump suggested, Chicago’s progress has contributed to the national decline in violent crime.We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"No, there aren’t 14,000 abandoned wind turbines littered across the United States","Missouri recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, north of Columbia. In April, President Donald Trump made the ""pants on fire"" claim that windmills cause cancer. Locally, renewable energy companies that fund wind energy projects in Missouri have recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, just south of Harrisburg.Now, a widely-circulated chain email has resurfaced a claim industry experts have seen all too often: ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States.""This isn’t true. Wind energy proponents have been trying to dispel the claim for years, and 14,000 seems to be a fabricated number. The trouble is no one can say exactly how many ""abandoned"" wind turbines there are.Much of the email chain’s content appears to have been copied from an article on a blog site called American Elephants, which describes itself as a home of conservatives. The anonymous blog post was published July 7, 2013, meaning this claim is at least six years old.Wind energy experts have been trying to debunk this claim as a myth for just as long.""It’s bullshit,"" said Paul Gipe, who has published five books on wind energy since 1995 and who has closely studied California’s wind farms. (Now the American Wind Energy Association does that.)Gipe said there have never been 14,000 abandoned wind turbines in California, in the United States, in North America or anywhere in the world. But at one time, there were approximately 14,000 wind turbines in California, total. He says he is ""the author of that number"" and believes that it is the origin of the 14,000 figure used in the email chain.Experts from the wind energy association agree that the claim is blatantly false, but the organization has struggled to correct the misconception.""We know for a fact that it’s not true,"" said Kaitlin Monaghan, the association’s deputy director of permitting and asset management policy. ""We’re not sure why it’s been so hard for us to myth-bust it or why it’s kind of still floating around out there, but I think sometimes that’s how it goes.""James Owen, executive director of Renew Energy, a company that champions renewable energy , said he doesn’t know of any abandoned wind turbines in the state of Missouri. He, too, agreed that there is no evidence for the abandoned turbines claim.""To the extent I’ve seen, there’s absolutely no basis for that,"" Owen said. ""It just seems like a number that was made up.""Monaghan acknowledged that wind turbines age and typically have a useful life of 20 to 30 years. At that time, she said old equipment must be taken down, repaired or replaced.If a project owner chooses to close a wind farm completely, Monaghan explained, it is the responsibility of the owner to decommission the farm, which includes removing wind turbines and restoring the land to its original state. She said there are often local and state laws that require this of individuals operating wind farms.However, 99% of wind projects are built on private land, so lease contracts for land used for turbines often include requirements for project owners to remove turbines and restore land when a project is shut down, Monaghan said.With this in mind, Monaghan explained that there are a number of reasons why project owners would not simply ""abandon"" wind turbines — meaning leave turbines standing despite not being functional. In areas where constructing wind farms requires permits, a project owner must often provide a detailed plan upfront for the eventual decommissioning of the project. Sometimes, owners will even have to provide a ""parent company guarantee,"" or some sort of financial backing, to reassure the community that no abandoned wind turbines will be left behind.On top of this, Monaghan said it would hurt companies’ reputations with landowners if they simply abandoned wind turbines. Turbines also have salvage value; the steel and other materials from a project could be repurposed or sold, Monaghan said.Finally, preexisting farms have already collected extensive wind speed data and have access to transmission lines. Greg Alvarez, deputy director of external communications for the wind energy association, explained that these features are valuable for projects and create ""very, very strong financial incentives to not let these sites sit vacant and abandoned.""As for those who believe companies are installing wind turbines to get a tax credit and then abandoning them, Owen said that was a ""patently absurd"" idea because companies only make money by selling power generated by the turbines. He said it was also a misunderstanding of the tax credit available.""The tax credits they’re talking about are production tax credits,"" Owen said, ""so they don’t get the tax credit unless they’re producing something.""The U.S. Wind Turbine Database indicates that there are 60,576 turbines operating in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and Guam. In total, wind energy supplies just under 7% of the country’s electricity, according to Alvarez. He said the U.S. wind industry has 97,000 megawatts of installed capacity, which is enough to power about 30 million average American homes.Energy production is tracked and recorded, as is the installation of wind turbines, but no one is tracking the number of abandoned wind turbines.The wind energy association's experts said that at most, there is a small number of nonoperational wind turbines that may appear to be abandoned even if they are not. Beyond that, they couldn’t be more specific.Gipe’s best estimate of the actual number of abandoned U.S. wind turbines was somewhere ""in the hundreds"" but not the thousands.The email chain argues that ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States."" There is not now, nor has there ever been, research to support the claim. Industry experts have been fighting to debunk the myth for years.We rate this ridiculous claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump says impeachment is a coup. That's Pants on Fire,"Amid the pressure of a House impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump has continued to stoke the idea that he’s the victim of a coup — shorthand for ""coup d’etat,"" a French term that means the overthrow of the government.However, his use of the word ""coup"" to describe impeachment, a constitutionally defined process, is not accurate, even as a figure of speech.Let’s start with a more literal definition. The key element of a coup is that it is carried out beyond the bounds of legality.Violence is part of many coups, but being violent is not a necessary condition.Of the 12 types of coups recognized by the Cline Center, nine do not seem to have anything to do with what Trump is talking about, including military coups, rebel coups, popular revolts, dissident actions, palace coups, foreign coups, internationally mediated transitions, forced resignations, and self-coups, in which the leader strong-arms other branches of government to entrench power.Two other types are defined by how far they got — attempted coups (which try and fail) and coup conspiracies (which never get to the stage of being carried out). Any supposed coup against Trump would have been a coup attempt, since he’s still in office. But that doesn’t mean there actually was a coup attempt.Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor, told us that you can’t get much more within the bounds of legality than an explicit power outlined in the Constitution.""It’s obviously not a coup for the House to launch impeachment proceedings,"" Klarman told us in early October.The lead author of the Cline Center report, University of Illinois political scientist Peter F. Nardulli, called Trump’s usage ""ill-informed.""""What is going on today in the United States is a constitutionally sanctioned process that is an integral part of the checks and balances that have been vital to the longevity and success of the U.S. Constitution and the Republic it created,"" he told PolitiFact.He added that ""there is nothing sudden or decisive about what is going on in the House of Representatives. It is conducting a deliberative, constitutionally sanctioned process. If an impeachment resolution is adopted, it will simply be forwarded to the Senate to conduct a trial.""Also, if Trump is removed from office, his duly elected vice president, Mike Pence, would take over -- not the opposition party.Experts largely acknowledged that the word has more informal uses, and they retroactively admonished Democrats for using such language during Clinton’s impeachment.However, they said Trump is wrong — and ill-advised — to regularly encourage the use of the word ""coup"" to describe impeachment.While hyperbolic rhetoric is common in politics, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, ""what is unusual with Trump’s use of the term ‘coup’ is that it is the president who is using the term.""""President Trump is taking the lead in intensifying the rhetorical battle, which is bound to make the divide between his supporters and other Americans even deeper than it would be if legislators and pundits were using the term,"" Smith said. Such an approach ""will justify more radical strategies in the future.""Nardulli of the University of Illinois added that ""there are good reasons that, like facts, people are not entitled to choose their own definitions of important things such as coups, especially when those definitions are self-serving.""In fact, Trump’s use of a word with such shock value is not an isolated incident, said Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College. It needs to be understood as part of a larger strategy, he said.In addition to weakening constitutional directives at home, the use of ""coup"" sends a signal to anti-democratic forces overseas, said Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University.""At a time when the rule of law is under threat in both the United States and throughout the world, I think it is important to differentiate the legitimate impeachment process from illegal attempts to overthrow a government,"" Arend said. ""People may differ on whether they believe there is sufficient evidence to merit impeachment or removal from office, but the use of the impeachment process as established in the Constitution does not constitute a ‘coup.’'Trump has used the term ""coup"" to describe the impeachment process, and has approvingly retweeted allies who have used it.Trump’s campaign said the word can be applied more informally than as an extra-legal ouster of a government. However, Trump’s repeated use of the term alongside such other inflammatory charges such as ""treason"" suggests that he is using it intentionally to call into question the legitimacy of a constitutionally prescribed process.His statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Andrew Yang's claim of support among Trump voters rates Pants on Fire," Democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang has regularly touted his cross-partisan appeal, and he usually cites a particular data point to make that case.A reader asked us to check whether this was true, so we took a closer look.Out of 1,500 total adult respondents, 460 said they were planning to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. Separately, poll respondents had been asked who they voted for in 2016, Trump or Hillary Clinton. Of those 460, 41 said they had voted for Trump in 2016.Of those 41 voters, 10% said they would support Yang, ranking him second to Bernie Sanders at 14%. Other candidates close to double digits were Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Julian Castro at 8%, while 12% said they weren’t sure.This tracks with what Yang said. But coming from the guy who says he wants to ""Make America Think Harder,"" Yang needs a course in how polling works.The Economist/YouGov poll has asked the same question every week since the July 21-23 survey Yang cited. The later polls squash any notion that Yang has high support among Trump voters. Of the 11 subsequent polls, Yang only matched or exceeded 10% twice. More often, Yang’s share of the Trump vote was much lower than that. In the most recent poll, Yang’s share of the Trump voter support was zero.In fact, the July poll Yang cites is the only time Yang finished in the top two among Democrats. And while Yang says he was only one of two candidates to surpass 10%, if you look across all of the polls, eight candidates actually achieved that — Yang, Biden, Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, Michael Bennet and Steve Bullock.The full breakdown of the polls is attached at the bottom of this fact-check.Ignoring all of the above (even though you shouldn’t), polling experts say the figure Yang cites is meaningless, because of the small sample of participants surveyed.In most of the Economist/YouGov polls, roughly 30-40 people said they voted for Trump in 2016 but would be voting in a Democratic primary or caucus in 2020. Ten percent of that (which is near Yang’s high water mark) would represent three to four people.Steve Smith, a Washington University political scientist who runs his own online panel survey, said that corresponds to a standard margin of error of about plus or minus 15 percentage points. That renders the question useless to anyone who cares about statistics, polling or math.When we checked with Joe Williams, the YouGov director of polling, he said he agreed with our overall analysis of Yang’s assertion. When we contacted the Yang campaign, they said they stood by their talking point.Yang said, ""I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general"" election.This claim comes from one poll in July that sampled 41 Trump voters who said they planned to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. The question has been asked by the same pollster weekly since July, and those results have never been replicated.Even if they had, the margin of error for a sample size that small is about 15 percentage points, rendering them essentially meaningless.The math isn’t hard on this one. We rate Yang’s claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Eric Trump’s false claim that the Trump family ‘got out of all international business’,"Eric Trump, President Donald Trump’s second son, falsely claimed the Trump family children ""got out of all international business"" after their father took office.But as they accuse Hunter Biden of riding his family name to a fortune in Ukraine, the Trump children have put almost no stops to their own overseas business dealings, we found. Multiple news outlets and government accountability groups have documented international business dealings Eric Trump and his siblings have conducted since Donald Trump took office. In some cases, the Trump children themselves have celebrated their activities overseas.In addition to managing existing properties and licensures, the Trump brothers have built on deals that were already in the works or inked before Trump became president, in some cases going back and giving new life to old projects that had previously seemed abandoned.""Some Trump-branded foreign projects have only been made public after Trump’s election and others have significantly expanded,"" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Projects that appeared to be long-forgotten or dormant were also revisited after Trump's election.""""Let's not forget that each year President Trump lists numerous international ventures in his financial disclosure records,"" Amey said, adding that Eric Trump’s claim was ""incorrect.""Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who both serve advisory roles in the White House, have also benefited from foreign business ties since Trump took office.""Certainly, filing for trademarks in an international country would count as international business,"" said Jessica Tillipman, assistant dean and a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.Eric Trump said, ""When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.""The Trump Organization said it would not make new foreign deals during Donald Trump’s presidency. But the Trump brothers have traveled across the globe, managing properties and taking action on deals that they say were signed or under works before Trump took office.Regardless of whether these moves should be considered new foreign deals, it’s ridiculous to claim the Trump family children stopped all international business after their father’s election.We rate this statement Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump is wrong. Whistleblower account of Ukraine phone call was 'almost completely' right,"When President Donald Trump heard that a second whistleblower was in the wings, he quickly dismissed the news.The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty.

PANTS-FIRE,Are half of those arrested for DWIs on I-35 unauthorized immigrants?,"During a panel on the border crisis hosted by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, a Republican from Central Texas, answered questions alongside Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.Williams said he is frustrated when he hears people characterize the situation at the border as a ""homemade crisis"" or a ""made-up crisis.""""We’re doing everything we can do to help these folks, but at the same time, we’ve got to get back to defending our borders and the rule of law,"" Williams said at the August event. ""I had a meeting with law enforcement in my district and they said, here’s a fact for you — we’re all familiar with Interstate 35 — they said 50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification. So you give them a ticket, you can’t put them in jail because the jails are full here ... so you send them on their way.""There are a lot of problems with Williams’ claim.First of all, he appears to be conflating DUIs and DWIs. He referenced DUIs, an offense reserved for minors who are found to be operating a motor vehicle with any detectable amount of alcohol in their systems, but then went on to discuss placing offenders in jail.When minors in Texas are apprehended by law enforcement, they are taken to a juvenile processing office and then, if they are not released to a parent or guardian, to a juvenile detention facility.Also, his claim that individuals pulled over for DWIs are sent ""on their way"" with a ticket because jails in Texas are full is inaccurate. Jails across the state are at varying levels of occupancy and have different practices in place to handle capacity issues.Williams also did not specify which parts of the freeway he was considering and he did not offer a timeframe for his claim.After speaking with officials at five law enforcement agencies in Texas and reviewing different records related to arrests and immigration status, it is clear that there is no evidence to support Williams’ claim.None of the agencies we contacted could provide data to directly inform Williams’ statement. The information they could share revealed that a small percentage of all arrests for people driving while intoxicated are individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.No official figures on this claim are maintained by law enforcementInterstate 35 is a roughly 1,600-mile freeway that stretches from Laredo at the Texas-Mexico border to Minnesota. The road runs through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. About 504 miles of the freeway are in Texas.John Etue, chief of staff to Williams, said that the numbers came from law enforcement officers within the 25th Congressional District ""regarding their personal experiences while performing their duties within their areas of operation.""""These are not official Texas or DPS stats,"" he said.Etue declined a request to provide information about the officers who provided the information, including the agency where they work.I-35 is part of the state highway system and is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation. Various law enforcement agencies enforce traffic laws on these roadways, including the state’s Department of Public Safety, which houses the State Highway Patrol.Local law enforcement officers also enforce traffic laws on portions of the highways that are within their jurisdiction.We first turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety for its figures on drunken driving arrests on I-35, but a spokesperson said: ""The data you’re requesting is not something the department tracks.""Williams said he spoke with officers in the 25th Congressional District, so we turned to four law enforcement agencies with coverage areas that overlap with the portion of I-35 that runs through the district — the Austin Police Department, the Travis County sheriff’s office, the Hill County sheriff’s office and the Hillsboro Police Department.In Texas, local officers are allowed — but not required — to ask about the immigration status of any individual they detain, including during traffic stops. Local jails also are required to comply with requests from federal immigration authorities to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally.When a detainer is placed on an individual, local law enforcement must hold the individual for up to 48 hours, giving ICE agents time to respond and take custody of the individual.Other data highlights problem with Williams’ claimThe Austin Police Department provided figures about all arrests for driving while intoxicated on I-35, but could not provide information about immigration status.The department has made 3,904 DWI arrests on I-35 from January 2014 through the end of August this year, according to records provided by the department.The Travis County sheriff’s office tracks people booked into the county jail with DWI arrests who had been flagged by federal immigration authorities, but they do not filter the information by the location of the arrest.The jail houses individuals arrested across the county by many different law enforcement agencies.From Aug. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 6,182 bookings into the county jail on new DWI arrests. Of those arrests, 7.4% of those individuals had an ICE detainer.Also, in Travis County, the court tasked with handling DWI cases had information about DWI arrests and the percentage of people arrested who were from a different country, but court officials were not able to zero in on people here illegally or the location of the arrest. They also could not provide information on whether an individual had identification or not.Of all the DWI cases that went before the court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% involved people who were not U.S. citizens. It’s unclear what percentage of that group were people who were in the country illegally.Travis County Attorney David Escamilla, whose office prosecutes misdemeanors like DWIs, said he was not familiar with the figures cited by Williams.""I’ve never seen that type of metric and I find it highly improbable,"" Escamilla said.The Hillsboro Police Department was able to provide information about DWI arrests within its jurisdiction and the number of people arrested who were in the country illegally at the time of the arrest, but they could not limit the arrests by location.From 2011 through 2019, the department made 180 DWI arrests. Of those, three people had ICE detainers. Of those three people, one did not have identification.Finally, Capt. Justin Motherspau at the Hill County sheriff’s office said the details in Williams’ claim are ""not something that we even have the ability to track.""Our rulingWilliams said, ""50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals. Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification.""There is no evidence to support Williams’ claim, which an aide said was based on a meeting he had with law enforcement officers in his district. The aide did not identify the officers or the agency where they worked.Data shows that small percentages of those charged with DWI in jurisdictions along I-35 within the 25th Congressional District lack legal immigration status.We rate this claim Pants on Fire.PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."

PANTS-FIRE,"Contrary to Bynum-Coleman's ad , Cox has steadily backed teacher raises","Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman is trying to label Speaker Kirk Cox as opponent of teacher raises in a contentious race for the 66th District House seat.Bynum-Coleman stopped the ad, and put up a new version the next day with the same claim and video, but amended sources. Cox’s campaign says the commercial is still inaccurate. So we fact-checked the second ad to see if Cox, a former teacher, ""joined with special interests to deny teachers a raise.""Cox’s Voting RecordCox joined the General Assembly in 1990. We tracked his voting record on teacher raises from 2005, which is the earliest year Bynum-Coleman cites in her contention that Cox has opposed pay hikes. Cox, a retired teacher, has been in a strong position to influence teacher pay. From, 2005-2017, he sat on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee of it that oversaw money going to public schools, and was on a small team of House negotiators who worked out final spending deals with the Senate. He became speaker in 2018.Teacher raises are not singled out for a vote in the General Assembly. They appear as line items in thick state budgets hundreds of pages long. Since 2005, the legislature has approved seven budgets with lasting teacher pay raises, a Cox voted for each one. Here are the raises:*2005, 3%;*2006, 3%;*2007. 3%;*2013, 2%;*2015, 1.5%;*2018, 3%; and*2019, 2%.The state paid half the amount of each raise and localities were responsible for the rest,There were also two times when Cox voted with the General Assembly to pass teacher pay raises and later supported rescinding them before they went into effect because of low state revenues.In 2008, Cox backed a 2% raise to start on July 1, 2009. In early 2009, as the state slid into the Great Recession, Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel rescind the pay hike.In 2016, he supported a 2% to begin July 1, 2017 if projected state revenues didn’t fall more than 1% below projections. Revenues missed that target and in early 2017 Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel the raise.Overall, Cox unfailingly voted each year for incremental  versions of the state budget that were passed by the Appropriations Committee, the House, and the full General Assembly. Don’t forget that he had an influential role at each step.Bynum-Coleman’s sourcesIn her amended second ad, Bynum Coleman offers three citations to back her claim that Cox ""joined special interests to deny teachers a raise."" All of them are at least eight years old. Parker Slaybaugh, Cox’s spokesman, said the speaker doesn’t recall any of the incidents.There’s no record of any action by Cox on the bill. Rob Silverstein, campaign manager for Bynum-Coleman, said that’s tantamount to Cox opposing raising teacher salaries to the national average. ""He could have moved the bill forward, but he let it die,"" Silverstein said.Bynum-Coleman’s third citation is a confusing editorial that ran in The Virginian-Pilot on Aug. 31, 2008.  It said Cox and two other delegates backed a change in the state school-funding formula ""that would have ended the state’s obligation to pick up a share of supplemental raises awarded by cities and counties."" What’s baffling is that the state doesn’t have an obligation - now or then - to pay a portion of teacher raises originating in localities. The opposite is true. We found nothing to corroborate the editorial in a search of state newspapers.We asked Silverstein if he knew details about the editorial’s statement. ""The story speaks for itself,"" he said.Special InterestsKey to Bynum-Coleman’s ad is her claim that Cox ""joined special interests"" in ""denying"" teacher pay raises. Our legislative memory, dating to 1986, doesn’t recall any organized lobby against teacher raises. The economy has been the driving force: In good times, teachers usually get raises; in tight times, they don’t.We asked Silverstein to identify the special interests. He said he was driving and would get back with an answer. We’re still waiting.Our rulingBynum-Coleman’s TV ad says ""Cox joined special interests to deny teachers raises.""  She had to temporarily pull the ad because it claimed Cox voted against a 2013 state budget with a teacher raise when, actually he supported it.Bynum-Coleman’s corrected ad offers three citations to back her claim, all of them at least seven years old. Two concern the death of bills in the House Appropriations Committee where Cox was a member, One in 2005, would have set an open-ended  goal to raise teacher salaries to the national average; the other would have let school boards spend surpluses in 2013 for a one-time bonus. The third source is two confusing sentences in a 2008 editorial. Cox says he doesn’t remember any of these occasions and it would be nice if he did. None of Bynum’s evidence of leads to a recorded vote although Cox, if he followed form, was likely to have gone along with the committee’s Republican majority. And none of her evidence centers on Cox’s actions when there was money on the table for salary increases.There have been seven budgets since 2005 that raised teacher salaries and Cox voted for each one. Two other times, he supported budgets with pay raises, and a year later voted with the General Assembly to rescind them before they took effect because of flagging state revenues.All told, Cox’s record matches the legislature’s since 2005. He voted for nine teacher pay hikes and twice to later cancel them.   Bynum-Coleman offers no proof for her charge Cox joined special interests to stop teacher raises.

PANTS-FIRE,"Hillary Clinton way off, again, on Wisconsin voter ID","Or, more specifically, can’t quit blaming its voting system for her 2016 electoral defeat.""Experts estimate that anywhere from 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin citizen voters, predominantly in Milwaukee, were turned away from the polls,"" Clinton said. ""That’s a lot of potential voters. They showed up, but maybe they didn’t have the correct form of identification. Maybe the name on their driver’s license included a middle name or an initial that wasn’t on their voter registration. But officials made every excuse in the book to prevent certain people from voting in that election.""That’s a lot of people to be ""turned away"" from polling places.So let’s recap this. Again.Spoiler alert: Clinton’s numbers still aren’t anywhere close to accurate.Clinton’s team didn’t respond to our request for evidence, but the vastly different numbers she cites — 27,000 and 200,000 — roughly reflect two analyses that examined voter ID impact in the 2016 election.If Wisconsin’s turnout had instead risen by 1.3%, Priorities USA estimated that would generate 200,000 more votes. The analysis called these the ""theoretical 200,000 lost voters.""But that’s very different than tallying specific people ""turned away"" from the polls, as Clinton claimed.In any case, the 200,000 has its own problems. Experts we’ve quoted in past fact checks said it’s not reasonable to attribute all the changes in turnout to the voter ID law when general enthusiasm — including for Clinton’s candidacy — and other factors doubtless played a role.The study estimated a total 12,000 registrants were affected by the ID requirement in those two counties.But its findings don’t at all match how Clinton phrased her claim, according to the author.Mayer said he saw anecdotal reports of people being turned away, and the UW study asked people if that happened to them.""It was small enough that we regarded it as not material to the overall conclusion,"" Mayer said.Firmer numbers are hard to come by.Not everyone who showed up without ID would cast such a ballot, of course. But it’s one measure of how often ID issues surfaced at the polls.Mayer said we simply don’t know how many people were turned away. But he said Clinton’s number isn’t realistic.""There is no possibility that (200,000) happened, because that would have been on the order of 60 people per polling place,"" he said, referencing the state’s roughly 3,500 polling locations.""Given the problematic nature of that (UW) estimate, estimates that are larger than that are even more out of the realm of reasonable possibility,"" Flanders told PolitiFact Wisconsin.Clinton said between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were ""turned away"" from the polls in 2016 due to lack of proper identification.But studies examining voter ID here say nothing of the sort.They looked broadly at how voter turnout changed — which includes the far larger number who simply stayed away. Experts say there is no reliable number for how many were physically turned away, but the existing work leaves no doubt it’s far short of the range cited by Clinton.This is the third time we have rated claims from Clinton on the Wisconsin turnout. She’s no closer on this one than the last one.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

""In the foreign policy field, Bolton’s speciality, the interventionists have been conservative Republicans.""""From Central America in the 1980s to the Middle East today, conservatives have been the ones who think that the United States can get its abroad way by ‘brute force,’"" he said.Here are some of Bolton’s recent statements about foreign policy:We also found no evidence to support Carlson’s claim that Bolton ""promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council.""

Even though the words come from Trump, the Bishop campaign chose to use the claim in its ad, so we are rating Bishop in this fact-check. Next, the ad shows McCready alongside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and freshman Rep.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump said ‘almost all models predicted’ Dorian would hit Alabama. He’s wrong,"Armed with spaghetti models and a Sharpie-doctored map, President Donald Trump defended his efforts to declare that once upon a time, Alabama was poised to face Hurricane Dorian’s wrath.He even went so far as to say that there was a 95% chance that Alabama was on the hurricane’s path.But Trump’s receipts don’t check out. This is the story of how the president mangled government models of the storm to blow the forecast way out of proportion and misinform Americans. The White House did not answer our questionsSo, as he briefed reporters on the latest updates Sept. 4, he asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan to display a chart of the ""original"" forecast. ""I know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go — actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be presented, where we had many lines going directly — many models — each line being a model.  And they were going directly through. And, in all cases, Alabama was hit — if not lightly, in some cases pretty hard. Georgia, Alabama — it was a different route. They actually gave that a 95% chance probability.""""This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!""And apparently, the president.While the graphic Trump tweeted did show a few lines going through Alabama, McNoldy said the lines ""are not all equals and should not be interpreted as such.""""Even so, only a small handful were there, hardly a 95% chance or ‘in all cases,’ "" he said.The fine print of the graphic says ""If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.""As for Trump’s potentially Sharpied cone map, that also looks like a case of exaggerating one of many five-day forecasts. The edge of the cone represents a two-thirds probability of the center of the storm tracking within it, using average track errors from the previous five years, McNoldy said.By the weekend, there was growing consensus that Hurricane Dorian would turn north before it eventually reached Florida, Curry said.""There was never a substantial probability of it reaching Alabama,"" she said.There was a period of time when the Gulf really was threatened in the extended range beyond five days, said Keith G. Blackwell and Andrew Murray, two University of South Alabama meteorologists. Ultimately, there was a very small chance that Dorian could have reached Alabama, but Trump overstated what earlier predictions showed.""In no way was Alabama a likely target, but there was a small chance that Dorian could have entered the Gulf of Mexico,"" Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach said. ""But, I think the key point is that NOAA never discussed that scenario, because it was likely at least one week out from when this guidance was available.""Trump tweeted that originally ""almost all models predicted"" Dorian would hit Alabama.He linked to a spaghetti models map that showed various models through the next 10 days. While some of those models showed Dorian hitting Alabama, Trump has grossly overstated what it showed.The National Hurricane Center takes these models and then comes up with a five-day forecast. It’s ridiculous for him to use the models to conclude that it showed almost all predicted the storm would hit Alabama, which matches our definition of Pants on Fire. "

PANTS-FIRE,"The Pants on Fire claim that Donald Trump has as much blood on his hands as Hitler, Stalin, Mao","Does President Donald Trump rank alongside the 20th century’s bloodiest dictators? A prominent psychiatrist said so during an interview on CNN.Allen James Frances, the chairman emeritus of Duke University’s department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, appeared on CNN’s ""Reliable Sources,"" a program hosted by Brian Stelter that analyzes the news media. Frances – who played a key role in the publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the reference work that defines recognized psychiatric conditions – was brought on the show to discuss how the media should cover those who question Trump’s mental fitness for office.""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person.""Frances also elaborated on Twitter, saying he was referring to the future death toll from climate change, hastened by Trump’s policies:""Terrible damage Trump is doing to world climate at this global warming tipping point may be irreversable/could kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades. Many of them our children & grandchildren & their children. This is an existential crisis for humanity.""We decided to take a closer look at Frances’ original comment.In interviews with PolitiFact, historians of the 20th century and experts on climate change both agreed that Frances made an extraordinarily flawed comparison to put Trump in the company of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.""Much as I abhor Trump’s climate policies, calling him Hitler seems inappropriate to me,"" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor of earth system science. ""Trump’s climate and environmental policies are destructive. Calling him Hitler, though, is a distraction. It helps him marginalize criticism.""""Frances’s statement is shockingly stupid and uninformed for someone with a respectable and responsible position,"" said Benjamin Hett, a historian at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and author of ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic.""Frances did not respond to inquiries for this article. A spokesman for Duke said that Frances is retired from the university and has no current responsibilities. The death toll for each of the three 20th century dictators is subject to some disagreement and  margin of error, but authoritative accountings suggest that each was responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million or more.Mao, for his part, may have exceeded them both.Using the 250,000-a-year figure, it would take about 40 years of Trump-related deaths from climate change to meet the low end of the Hitler and Stalin death counts. To reach Mao’s death toll of 42.5 million, it would take 170 years. But even if the WHO estimate is low, it’s clear that you’d have to stick Trump with the blame for many decades worth of global deaths from climate change to compete with Hitler, Stalin or Mao.Even experts who decry Trump’s climate policies note that any future deaths will not be solely attributable to him. The process has been underway long before Trump entered the Oval Office. In addition, countless other factors – from corporate policies to individuals’ own actions – have brought us to where we are today. ""When Trump took office, we were already committed to the ocean and atmospheric warming that we are seeing now, the basically irreversible acceleration in polar ice melt we are seeing now, the accelerating melt of permafrost and its effects we are seeing now, and the accelerating sea level rise we are seeing now,"" said Harold R. Wanless, a professor of geography and regional studies at the University of Miami.Given this, Wanless said, the blame should be shared with all preceding administrations and congresses since about 1979, ""when it became apparent that climate change was happening, was starting to produce these changes, was basically irreversible, and would be made worse and worse as we added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."" Wanless termed Frances’ comparison ""naïve, irresponsible, and purely political.""Peter Fritzsche, a University of Illinois historian, told PolitiFact that ""it seems silly to find a single embodiment to the problem of climate change,"" he said. ""Trump is a poster boy of ignorance, but the problem is much much larger, more serious, more difficult.""Fritzsche suggested a different comparison – presidents such as Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan whose inaction made the Civil War inevitable.""I would compare Trump to the weak presidents of the 1850s who completely failed to see -- purposefully -- the conflict between North and South, the expansion of slavery in the West, and the issue of fugitive slaves,"" he said.Frances said, ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.""Not only does Frances’ comparison exaggerate the predicted climate change death toll compared to that of the dictators, he also lays the blame for potential future deaths at Trump’s feet alone, which even experts critical of Trump consider wrongheaded.

PANTS-FIRE,Gavin Newsom’s ridiculous claim: ‘Vast majority’ of San Francisco’s homeless people come from Texas,"There are many reasons for San Francisco’s homelessness crisis: Gentrification. Job losses. Evictions. Mental health and substance abuse struggles. But … Texas? California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently blamed the Lone Star State for somehow producing the bulk of the city’s homeless population. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco from January 2004 through January 2011. The Democratic governor was asked during a June interview on ""Axios on HBO"" why San Francisco’s homeless population did not experience a net decline during his tenure as mayor. Newsom said most of the homeless people on the street when he left office were not from California, but added ""we took responsibility"" for them. He then made the head-scratching claim about Texas. ""The vast majority (of San Francisco’s homeless people) also come in from — and we know this — from Texas. Just (an) interesting fact,"" Newsom said. We decided to dig in for our own fact check. Our researchThey consistently show a large majority of people surveyed said they lived in San Francisco prior to becoming homeless. A smaller share said they lived in another California county. Often the smallest percentage said they lived out of state before becoming homeless in San Francisco. ""The data shows (Newsom’s statement) is completely and totally incorrect,"" said Jennifer Friedenback, executive director of San Francisco-based Coalition of Homelessness. ""Newsom knows better, by the way."" Shanna Couper Orona sits outside her RV in San Francisco. A federally mandated count of homeless people in San Francisco showed a 17 percent increase from 2017 to 2019. It was driven, in part, by a surge of people living in vehicles. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)Newsom’s responseThe data includes travel destinations for the program from 2004 through 2018. It shows approximately 20 percent of Homeward Bound’s trips, or about 2,400, took place inside California during that period. About 80 percent took place out of state. Texas was the most popular destination outside of California, with 827 trips or 6.7 percent of the program’s 12,268 trips since it started. The next most popular were Washington state, at 5.8 percent, and Florida, at 5.4 percent.At 6.7 percent, Texas in no way can be described as accounting for ""the vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless population. It also doesn't mean all those who took a trip to Texas were necessarily from that state. All it means is ""you have someone you can stay with"" in that state, not that you were born or raised there, Friedenbach noted. She added that some African Americans who have been displaced and left homeless in San Francisco in recent years have family ties in Texas or other southern states, but did not necessarily grow up there. Homeward Bound’s requirements say nothing about needing to be from a particular state. Here’s what they do say:""The Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing can provide you with a bus ticket home if you: are homeless/low income and living in San Francisco; and have family or friends at the destination that Homeward Bound staff can verify as willing and able to provide you a place to stay and ongoing support; and are medically stable enough to travel unassisted to the destination; and are sober and able to abstain from alcohol or using other substances en route.""Calls to San Francisco’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing were not returned. Our rulingCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed the ""vast majority"" of San Francisco’s homeless people come in from Texas.San Francisco’s own homeless surveys contradict this. They show a large majority reported living in the city before becoming homeless, and just a fraction coming in from out-of-state. Newsom’s office pointed to data from San Francisco’s bus ticket program for homeless people. But that defense doesn’t hold up. It shows just a small fraction, less than 7 percent, left for Texas, and doesn’t demonstrate that they originally came to San Francisco from that state. In the end, we found Newsom made a ridiculous claim. We rated it Pants on Fire."

She is an adult, though, not a little girl as the Facebook post suggests, and there is no evidence that she is a crisis actor, much less the daughter of a Trump appointee. Sharon Howard, a spokesperson for the Miami Valley Hospital, would not comment directly on the Facebook post’s allegations. But she told us that all of the hospital’s patients are adults and all of the photos the White House released following the president’s visit are legitimate. While Trump was at the hospital, Howard said, he met with the three patients who were still checked in following the shooting, and he met with their families, first responders and the medical team that treated the patients. He did not meet with any other patients while he was there, she said. These images are of two different people.We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Epstein not dead? Conspiracy theories abound,"Questions swirl around the circumstances of financier Jeffrey Epstein’s death.

U.S. Attorney General William Barr said he is ""appalled"" by the ""failure to adequately secure"" Epstein.But in the eyes of some on Facebook, Epstein is still very much alive.Whether Epstein was on a suicide watch is a major point of controversy.But regarding whether he still lives, there are a number of people in official positions who have confirmed that Epstein is dead.The U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced his death.One of Epstein’s lawyers Marc Fernich blamed prosecutors, the press and the Manhattan Correctional Center, where Epstein was held.Those details notwithstanding, the conspiracy theorists are undaunted.Whatever the investigation finds, it would not change the fact that Epstein is dead. Bloggers and Facebookers are saying that Epstein is still alive.U.S. corrections officials announced his death. The New York City medical examiner performed an autopsy. The U.S. Attorney General, federal prosecutors and an Epstein lawyer have said he is dead.To think otherwise requires that scores of officials with direct observation of Epstein’s death are either fooled or complicit.This claim is Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump didn't talk about exterminating Latinos,"Several Democratic presidential candidates have declared a link between President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants and the recent mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.But while Trump has spoken often of an ""invasion"" at the border, he has not been ""talking about exterminating Latinos,"" as MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace falsely claimed Aug. 5.Wallace was responding to a remark from guest and columnist Raul Reyes, who said Trump’s use of the words ""invasion"" and ""infestation"" could make some people wish for an extermination. ""With an infestation, the natural conclusion is to attempt an extermination,"" Reyes said.As a point of comparison, Wallace noted how President George W. Bush (for whom she served as communications director) catered to Latino voters and President Barack Obama tried to take on immigration reform with input from Latino leaders. ""You now have a president, as you said, talking about exterminating Latinos,"" she continued.I misspoke about Trump calling for an extermination of Latinos. My mistake was unintentional and I’m sorry. Trump’s constant assault on people of color and his use of the word “invasion” to describe the flow of immigrants is intentional and constant.But Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, told us ""many more will hear what she said on air than her apology.""Here’s the bottom line: Trump has frequently charged immigrants with invading the United States, but he’s never spoken of ""exterminating Latinos.""Trump has never used any version of the word ""exterminate"" to describe Latinos, Hispanics or immigrants in or en route to the United States. We checked Google and Nexis and found no examples. A search of the president’s Twitter account also turned up no results. While Trump hasn’t called for ""exterminating Latinos,"" he has made frequent use of the words ""invasion"" and ""infestation"" to decry the flow of immigrants across the southern border. Wallace said Trump is ""talking about exterminating Latinos.""Trump has frequently labeled the flow of immigrants an ""invasion"" and railed against ""infested"" areas of the country. But he hasn’t said anything about ""exterminating Latinos.""The context of the interview was about words and their meanings.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, President Trump wasn’t ‘kicked off’ the California ballot. That’s Pants on Fire.","It asks supporters to donate to get Trump ""back on the ballot."" The message goes on to claim ""Governor Newsom signed SB27, preventing President Trump from appearing on next year’s ballot. The law is clearly unconstitutional and disenfranchises millions of California voters. We need your support to overturn SB27.""We set out on a fact check. Our research Instead, it requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state’s primary. The requirement does not extend to the general election.Here’s what the law says: ""This bill would enact the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, which would require a candidate for President, in order to have the candidate’s name placed upon a primary election ballot, to file the candidate’s income tax returns for the 5 most recent taxable years with the Secretary of State, as specified.""Trump has refused to release his returns, saying since his campaign for president they are under audit. Trump, the Republican National Committee and California Republican Party have all filed lawsuits over SB 27, arguing it is unconstitutional and ""a naked political attack"" on Trump. The law passed on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.Some legal analysts have questioned it, as did former Gov. Jerry Brown when he vetoed a similar law two years ago, saying it would create a slippery slope of trying to force candidates to release additional information to run for president. The courts will eventually decide on its constitutionality. But as it stands, it does not prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot. But it doesn’t provide any information showing Trump was kicked off the ballot or prevented from being on it. California is still several months from finalizing its ballot for the March 2020 primary. After we asked about the claim, the headline on the party’s website changed slightly from President Trump ""kicked off"" the ballot to President Trump ""off"" the ballot. Another line changed from asking donors to contribute to get Trump ""back on the ballot"" to get him ""on the ballot.""Our rulingThe California Republican Party recently claimed President Trump was ""kicked off the California ballot"" as a result of Senate Bill 27. The recently signed law requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state’s primary. It does not apply to candidates in the general election.Republicans are challenging the law in court, saying it’s unconstitutional. The law very well may be struck down by a court. But, as written, it does not kick Trump off the ballot or prevent him from being on it. That ballot is still several months from being finalized. It might be a difficult decision for Trump to release his tax returns, which he has refused to do, but it still provides this avenue for him and all future candidates for president and governor to appear on the primary ballot. The message on the state party’s website is blatantly false, ignores any mention of what’s actually in the law and how candidates can comply. What’s more, the false message is being used as a fundraiser. For these reasons, we rate it Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Pants on Fire: State rep claims mass shootings are down under Trump,"""Less mass shootings under Trump! His base doesn't hate anyone,"" declared Tusler, R-Harrison, in a since-deleted post.That’s quite the disparity. There’s a lot to cover — and a lot wrong — in this seemingly simple claim. Let’s break it down.Tusler’s claim is ridiculous on multiple fronts.So the data at best ends a year and a half ago, reflecting less than half of Trump’s time in office to date.The chart itself is flawed as well. Converting the LA Times narratives to a chart implies a degree of consistency and comprehensiveness that the newspaper did not intend. The article didn’t define any criteria for inclusion aside from a sentence at the top saying, ""Here are some of the most notable mass shootings in the U.S. in recent decades.""The National Affairs chart is particularly haphazard since it added in the Florida shooting but ignored the Texas First Baptist Church massacre in November 2017 that killed more people.The broader issue with both the chart and Tusler’s claim is the use of raw numbers to compare one partial term under Trump to two full terms under Obama.Simple tallies will, of course, be larger over a longer time period.So what are those tallies? And how does Tusler’s claim about less shootings hold up to a better comparison, such as mass shootings per year?Those answers depend on how you define a mass shooting.Though bandied about in politics, media and culture, there is no universally accepted definition of the term. We turned to the Washington Post and Mother Jones, since both have been tracking this subject in detail and have data going back several presidential administrations.We find a trend line that doesn’t match up with particular presidents or party control, it simply shows a steady increase in shootings over time. Our analysis of The Washington Post data shows an average of 2.4 mass shootings per year under President Ronald Reagan, 2.3 under George H. W. Bush and 3.6 under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The rate jumps to 5.1 per year under Obama and 7.9 per year so far under Trump — a roughly 50% increase.In terms of raw numbers, that’s 41 shootings in the eight years Obama was in office, compared to 20 already in the two and a half under Trump.The data from Mother Jones shows a similar trend, though the numbers are different since they have a broader definition of mass shootings and aren’t as comprehensive as the Post in prior years. Mother Jones reports 1 to 2 shootings per year from the Reagan era through George W. Bush, then 4.8 under Obama and 11.5 under Trump.(The Gun Violence Archive doesn’t shed much light on this claim since it only goes back to 2014.)We asked Tusler if he was aware the data was outdated, and whether he felt raw numbers were a fair way to compare Trump and Obama.""If there is newer data, please provide it and I would update. I prefer the most up to date information,"" he said in a Facebook message. ""I don't think raw numbers tell the whole story. But, at least they are not interpreted with a bias.""It’s an ironic response given that it’s the use of raw numbers that paints a skewed picture of the Trump and Obama eras. Doing an annual average equalizes the comparison.Tusler said he thought the data was more recent and had removed the post from Facebook, though it remained until this fact check published.In the wake of two mass shootings that left 31 dead in the span of 13 hours, Tusler claimed there have been fewer such shootings under Trump than Obama.That’s nonsense.The chart Tusler based his claim on is both incomplete and outdated — including only half of Trump’s time in office. And it’s absurd to use a raw tally of shootings to compare just over two years under Trump to eight years under Obama.Using more comprehensive data and a reasonable criterion like shootings per year, we see that mass shootings have risen steadily in recent decades regardless of who is in the White House. So shootings are up — not down — under Trump.We rate Tusler’s claim Pants on Fire."

Bush June 1992 to Sarah McClendon (White House Press Corps)""Q: I don't see how it would have been possible.A: It would not have been possible, and it was not possible at the time to do so. I think George Bush said it very well in an interview with Sarah McClendon, the grand dame of the Washington press corps. When Bush consented to an interview with Mrs. McClendon in June of 1992, he said on record, which she printed in her newsletter that month, when she asked him about Iran-contra and he said, (and I'm quoting from her newsletter): ""If the people were to ever find out what we have done, we would be chased down the streets and lynched."" This was a public comment by George Bush.Q: George Bush actually admitted that?A: He said it and it was printed in Mrs. McClendon's newsletter in June of 1992.""So, let us enumerate this claim's flaws:First, it is unlikely that Bush, who publicly and vehemently denied any involvement in the scandal (which unfolded while he served as vice president), would say such a self-incriminating statement, especially to a journalist.Third, if the president made such an inflammatory and self-incriminating statement to the press about a high-profile scandal (especially while it was under heightened attention), it would have been picked up and republished by media outlets across the country.

PANTS-FIRE,Did study show that 70% of veterans who committed suicide had THC in their system?,"Texas lawmakers this year voted to broaden the state’s medical marijuana program to include more qualifying conditions than just intractable epilepsy.Under the bill, which was signed into law, patients with several more conditions, including terminal cancers, autism and multiple sclerosis, will now be eligible to participate in the program.During a debate in the Senate over the proposal, state Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, argued against including post-traumatic stress disorder in the bill. The disorder was ultimately not included in the bill that passed.""A study was done, a post-mortem, so a retrospective study done, looking at autopsies and drug levels, what drugs were in the blood of veterans that committed suicide, and 70 percent had THC,"" Campbell said.We decided to take a look at Campbell’s claim to see if a study of this nature existed and whether there’s a connection between veterans, marijuana use and suicide.No signs of Campbell’s studyCampbell’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We searched far and wide but could not find a study with results matching those described by Campbell. Several experts and advocates contacted for this piece said they were unaware of a study that reflected the findings Campbell described.Several studies examine the relationship between cannabis use and suicidal thoughts. Others have cross-referenced registry data on deaths attributed to suicide with the timing of the legalization of medical marijuana in the states where the suicides took place.In her study, which enlisted identical twins, one of whom used cannabis more frequently and the other who used it lightly or not at all did not use it all or lightly, found that the twins that used cannabis more often were more likely to report suicidal thoughts and depression.While the data suggests that the association is unrelated to shared genetics and early environment, it does not necessarily mean that the effects of cannabis were the cause, she said. It could have been another risk factor, such as trauma.The study noted, however, that other factors, such as coping with post-traumatic stress, managing chronic pain conditions related to war injuries, or adjusting to civilian life, could confound the association between the two. What makes this subject so hard to study? Agrawal said one reason is that suicide is such a complex behavior with many aspects — from contemplation, to attempts (with or without a plan) to actual deaths.""(Researchers) might have asked only of individuals who report experiencing depression, although suicidal thoughts and behaviors are not just limited to depression,"" Agrawal said. ""In studies of completed suicide, little may be known about the substance use history over and above a toxicology report.""Cannabis use and veteransResearch also is lacking on cannabis use and suicide among veterans specifically.Sharon Gilmartin, deputy director of Safe States Alliance, said she wasn’t aware of a statistic like the one Campbell cited.Gilmartin also cautioned against interpreting her organization’s studies or others that include toxicology data as definitively linking marijuana to suicide because of the nature of THC.""It’s not quite like alcohol where you have a certain BAC (blood alcohol content), and that directly links to impairment, then it goes away and you’re kind of back to sobriety more or less,"" Gilmartin said. ""When you think about THC, it’s a different dose-response relationship, and it also has a different latency period, so it stays in your blood long after you’re impaired.""There are also limitations to what such data can tell us, Agrawal said, because of that age-old statistical standard that ""correlation does not imply causation.""""While such studies show a correlation, it is difficult to know from data at one time point whether cannabis use is a causal factor,"" Agrawal said. ""Veterans are more likely to report cannabis use and are also at risk for suicide. But that doesn't answer the question as to how the two are related.""For example, she said, people who are vulnerable to suicide might use cannabis more often to self-medicate; or people who use cannabis more heavily may report more suicidal thoughts; or alternatively, some other factor might influence the use of both cannabis and risk for suicide, such as trauma exposure.Our rulingCampbell suggested that cannabis plays a role in suicide among veterans, claiming that a study showed 70 percent of veterans who committed suicide had THC in their body.But the study Campbell cited doesn’t seem to exist. Some research does exist on this topic, but experts questioned the validity of drawing a conclusion about the connection between marijuana use and suicide generally — let alone among veterans.We rate this claim Pants on Fire.PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."

Logan, the county elections official, confirmed the notices had been sent. Trump’s claim ‘completely inaccurate’""What they are saying is L.A. county holds on to too many inactive registrations,"" he told the AP. ""This whole thing does nothing to clean up the active voter file.""Reached for this fact check, Mitchell called Trump’s claim ""completely inaccurate."" Our rulingPresident Trump recently claimed California ""admitted"" there were ""a million"" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election, in an effort to support his widely debunked claim of massive voter fraud in the state. Trump cited a January settlement between the state and Judicial Watch. But that agreement says nothing about voter fraud or illegal voting. Instead, it requires Los Angeles County election officials to begin the process of removing inactive registrations, for people who have gone years without voting often because they’ve moved or died, to comply with federal law. It says all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county.State and county elections officials strongly rejected the president's statement.We found Trump's new voter fraud claim as baseless as his past allegations.We rate it Pants on Fire. "

PANTS-FIRE,Kirsten Gillibrand wrong about Donald Trump and bump stocks,"Gillibrand focused on bump stocks, the gun accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one — that is, from a weapon that requires a trigger pull to fire each round to one that shoots a steady stream of rounds with one trigger pull.In the June 2 town hall, Gillibrand said, ""Stop being beholden to the (National Rifle Association), like President Trump is. … Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, ‘Don’t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.’""A reader asked us to fact-check Gillibrand’s statement. We found that Gillibrand’s statement flagrantly disregarded the facts. Asked in the town hall about how to curb mass shootings, her answer was to attack — incorrectly — an instance in which Trump actually accomplished a goal that gun critics had sought, and where the administration directly disregarded the NRA, which had opposed an all-out ban.Bump stocks are now illegal in the United States, and it’s directly because of actions by the Trump administration. ""The senator is wrong,"" said Harold Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociologist who has studied gun policy.A shooting instructor demonstrates the grip on an AR-15 rifle fitted with a ""bump stock"" at a gun club in North Carolina in 2017. (AP)Groups that favor stronger gun laws applauded the move, though some criticized how long it took and the fact that the ban was done through the regulatory process rather than by a law passed by Congress.Gillibrand’s national press secretary Evan Lukaske said the senator was referring to the NRA’s opposition to — and seeming ability to block — congressional legislation on bump stocks, and the 10-month lag between Trump’s expression of openness until the final rule was published.""Sen. Gillibrand acknowledges that five months after the Las Vegas shooting, President Trump issued a ban that was enacted in December 2018, much to the NRA's chagrin,"" Lukaske said. ""Her statement supports the larger point, that the NRA uses money and influence to control members of the Republican Party, and prevent common sense gun reforms that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support.""Such concerns, however, do not get at the point of her town hall remark. She left the strong impression that bump stocks are still legal, and that Trump went back on his word. Both assertions are flatly incorrect.Gillibrand said, ""Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, (President Donald Trump) said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No.""Gillibrand’s effort to turn Trump into a villain on bump stocks flies in the face of the facts. In reality, bump stocks were a rare area in which Trump accomplished a goal sought by gun critics, and his administration’s rule was more forceful than what the NRA had sought. Thanks to the efforts of Trump and his administration, owning bump stocks is now a felony. We rate Gillibrand’s statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, more people will not enter the United States illegally than be born here in a year","""This will stagger you,"" Patrick said, referencing Dobbs’ report on birth rates. ""We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year.""""We’re on pace to apprehend a million people crossing into this country illegally. Any law enforcement person you talk to — local sheriff, our state police — they will tell you that they catch one out of four or five. That means if we catch 1 million, there are 4 million others.""Patrick’s claim is wrong. No matter how generously we slice and dice the figures, his math does not add up.Patrick under on apprehension estimateAlejandro Garcia, spokesman for Patrick, pointed us to a few different sources for this claim: news reports about birth rates, projected border apprehensions for the coming year and a study that suggested the population of people in the country illegally is significantly higher than previously recorded.Let’s start with projected border apprehensions.The only problem here, as the article notes, is that this estimate ""includes illegal crossings and people arriving at ports of entry.""Similar claims have been made by federal officials in the past, with the same caveat, that their estimate counts both apprehensions of individuals crossing illegally and law enforcement encounters with individuals at ports of entry who are looking to enter the country legally.That number was based on average apprehensions from the first five months of the fiscal year, which spans from October to September. There are two more months of data available now, which has boosted the monthly average. Officials are now on track to make about 789,000 apprehensions this fiscal year.It’s also possible to come up with a similar estimate for the calendar year; Patrick didn’t specify which period he was considering. Given the monthly average of about 76,700 apprehensions for the first four months of the year, officials look to be on track to make about 920,400 apprehensions this calendar year.Patrick wrong on 1 out of 4 (or 5) claimGarcia pointed to a study published by researchers at the Yale University School of Management to support the last part of Patrick’s claim: that agents apprehend just one in every four or five individuals who attempt to enter the country illegally.The study looked to calculate how many undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and it found a mean population estimate of 22.1 million in 2016  — ""essentially double the current widely accepted estimate"" of 11.3 million.But Edward Kaplan, a professor at Yale University who authored the study, said the higher population count does not mean individuals are crossing the border at the rate Patrick suggested.""We do not estimate that 5 million people have crossed the border illegally in any single year during the time of our study,"" Kaplan said in an email, noting that the highest number of border crossings reported in the study was in 2000, when an estimated 2.6 million people crossed illegally.We asked Camarota to take a look at Patrick’s claim.Even though there has been an increase in apprehensions from previous years, Camarota said, far fewer than 4 million people will cross the border illegally this year.He said even if Patrick’s claim was limited just to births of native-born Americans (which Camarota estimated to be at about 3.1 million in 2017) or if he included estimates for people who overstay their visas in his calculation of illegally crossings, the ratio is off.""The bottom line is that it doesn’t seem possible you could get to 4 million,"" Camarota said, referencing the number of births recorded in 2017.The DHS report also includes estimates for ""got aways,"" people who were observed successfully crossing the border while evading apprehension, and ""total successful unlawful entries,"" a number calculated through statistical models and observable data.There were an estimated 104,000 ""got aways"" in 2017 (an 83% decrease from 615,000 in 2006) and 160,000 ""total successful unlawful entries"" in 2017 (a 92% decrease from 2.1 million in 2000).Our rulingPatrick said, ""We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year.""There is no evidence to support Patrick’s claim. While it is hard to say exactly how many people successfully enter the country illegally while evading detection, it’s safe to say that the real number is significantly smaller than Patrick’s 5 million.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Is Donald Trump the most transparent president ever? No,"Time and again, President Donald Trump has asserted that his administration has achieved championship-level transparency.But does his administration live up to the hype? It does not, whether one looks at his relations with Mueller’s team, his refusal to release his tax returns, or his unwillingness to cooperate with subpoenas from Congress.In fact, several experts we contacted said they laughed out loud when they first heard Trump make this claim. One of those was Jeffrey A. Engel, the founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.""The president was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation,"" the statement said. ""He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations. The White House and the administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting executive branch rights and privileges. In addition, the president and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.""However, our look into the Trump administration’s transparency record suggested that the current administration has been less -- not more -- transparent than other recent presidents.In addition, Mueller documented instances of Trump trying to impede the investigation or directing his staff to do so, including firing Mueller. ""The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful,"" the Mueller report notes, ""but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.""But experts say that Trump is well on his way to meeting or exceeding the scale of opposition by President Richard Nixon during Watergate, when non-cooperation with congressional subpoenas became a crucial element of impeachment articles against him.Trump regularly stops to take questions from reporters on the White House lawn or while he’s traveling from event to event. His aides do, too. But the regular, institutionalized and usually lengthier briefings by his administrations have slowed almost to zero.""I can’t think of an area where President Trump has been more transparent"" than Obama was, said John Wonderlich, executive director of the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation.Even one area that might be considered heightened transparency -- Trump’s Twitter feed -- actually serves to undermine scrutiny and openness.Trump’s tweets do provide an almost stream-of-consciousness report of what’s on his mind -- the kinds of insights that would normally emerge after a president left office and released diaries or wrote memoirs, said Laurie L. Rice, a political scientist at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville.Trump’s tweets are ""a form of government-to-public communication that circumvents the free press,"" said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.Trump said, ""There has never been, ever before, an administration that’s been so open and transparent.""Trump cited his cooperation with the Mueller investigation, but Mueller himself found several major shortcomings in the Trump White House’s efforts. Beyond that, the Trump administration has assembled a record of aggressive opposition to congressional subpoenas, a longstanding refusal to share his tax returns, a near-zeroing-out of press briefings, and larger numbers of lawsuits demanding the administration release information under FOIA.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

Askew explains that his father was a school counselor at the military school from 1955 to 1985.Let’s just get this out of the way: People have been conjecturing about presidential IQs for years, but we found no record of a presidential IQ being made public. Of course, many presidents died before the advent of the modern IQ test, the first versions of which were formulated in the early 1900s.That’s important, because if such a story exists –– that the president of the United States once received a 73 IQ test result –– it would not only be found easily on the internet, but the reporting would have been replicated by media organizations around the world. A search with zero results suggests the post is fabricated.Jack Serafin, vice president of the Regiment of Graduates for New York Military Academy, attended the school from 1962 to 1967, a period that overlapped with Trump, a 1964 graduate. Serafin told PolitiFact the claim holds no merit.""It's bogus, NYMA did not give IQ tests and the long time counselor of 30 years, ‘Askew,’ did not exist,"" Serafin wrote in an email.

PANTS-FIRE,Unfounded Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton resurfaces,"The first version of the conspiracy theory, which came about shortly after the bombing, implicated then-President Bill Clinton, saying he orchestrated the bombing to protect himself from the brewing scandal. The 21-Century meme version redirects the blame toward Hillary.""A common theme is that (Bill) Clinton or rogue factions within the government ordered the bombing to divert attention from embarrassing issues such as the Whitewater probe and the Branch Davidian siege in Waco, Tex.,"" the article states. ""Theorists have speculated that documents related to Whitewater or Waco were kept in the Oklahoma City federal building and destroyed in the blast; the government has denied this. Others believe that Clinton arranged for the death and destruction so he could come across as a strong leader amid the ensuing chaos and boost his sagging popularity.""If any part of the claim was true, not only would it have been documented in case files, but it would have been widely reported as a bombshell development in the scandal and the bombing, both of which were closely monitored by the national press.A meme on social media suggests Hillary Clinton had something to do with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing because she was to be ""indicted"" in a scandal four days after the bombing, but the blast destroyed documents related to the case.We could quibble about whether the Clintons were involved in any wrongdoing related to Whitewater, but the meme’s suggestion that Hillary was to be indicted days after the bombing, and that investigation documents related to the scandal were suspiciously destroyed in the event, is false and lacks any supporting evidence.We rate this conspiracy theory Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Was Donald Trump the target of a coup? No,"With the bulk of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report now public, President Donald Trump has seized on its origins as evidence of his own victimhood.""This was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government. ... I think it's far bigger than Watergate. I think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this country. Maybe beyond political. … This was a coup. This wasn't stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments. This was an attempted coup.""We wondered whether Trump is justified in saying that he had been targeted in a coup -- the shorthand for ""coup d’etat,"" a French term that means overthrow of the government. Experts told us that Trump’s use of the term is wrong, both practically and legally.Trump appears to believe that enemies within law enforcement concocted reasons to go after him over his campaign’s Russia contacts. Names that come up often in this alleged plot include Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two officials involved in the FBI investigation of then-candidate Trump. The two were involved romantically, and they shared text messages that Trump has said were biased against him. (Trump regularly attacks Strzok and Page on Twitter; in the interview with Hannity, he called them ""two sick lovers."")For those outside the Fox News orbit, the connections ""might make no sense,"" Bump writes. ""But for a Hannity viewer, and for Trump and Hannity in particular, it all makes perfect sense. It's a summary of a case about bias and personal flaws and unfairness that Fox News and Hannity have been making for a year.""The evolution of this ""feedback loop"" can be seen in Trump’s tweets.In late July 2016 — days after WikiLeaks’ dumped thousands of internal Democratic National Committee documents that proved damaging to Clinton — U.S. law enforcement became aware of Papadopoulos’ claim.""Within a week of the (WikiLeaks) release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign,"" said Mueller’s report (p. 6, volume 1). ""On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.""This investigation became Mueller’s special counsel investigation after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- standing in for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from Russia matters -- tapped Mueller to run the independent investigation.It’s worth noting that Mueller found no conspiracy with Russia; if Mueller had been part of a coup, he could have thrown Justice Department guidelines to the wind and indicted Trump.The significant point in this recap is that the investigation was undertaken by law enforcement, and that it adhered to the relevant laws.By contrast, the defining element of a coup is that it is carried out beyond the bounds of legality.Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor, told PolitiFact that the Russia investigation ""is not a coup, because the FBI had very good reasons for commencing an investigation of Trump. It beggars belief that anyone in the FBI had the intention of subverting a duly elected president.""Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, agreed.""By using the term ‘coup,’ the president is suggesting that Mueller, and by extension his own Justice Department, are acting outside the law,"" Arend said. Yet Mueller ""was appointed and supervised by Rod Rosenstein, the president's chosen deputy attorney general.""Of the 12 types of coups recognized by the Cline Center, nine do not seem to have anything to do with what Trump is talking about, including military coups, rebel coups, popular revolts, dissident actions, palace coups, foreign coups, internationally mediated transitions, forced resignations, and self-coups, in which the leader strong-arms other branches of government to entrench power.Two other types cited by the center are defined by how far they got -- attempted coups (which try and fail) and coup conspiracies (which never get to the stage of being carried out). Any supposed coup against Trump would have been a coup attempt, since he’s still in office. But that doesn’t mean there actually was a coup attempt.""Inasmuch as the Russia investigation began before Trump was elected, and at a time when it was universally assumed that Hillary Clinton would be elected, it cannot have been an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government,"" said Richard Bulliet, a Columbia University historian. ""It was an attempt by duly established arms of the state to prevent seizure of the government by a witting or unwitting Russian agent.""The lead author of the Cline Center report, University of Illinois political scientist Peter F. Nardulli, agreed that Trump’s definition wouldn’t fit.""The vast proportion of extralegal overthrows of the government involve violence,"" Nardulli said. ""What happened with Trump was simply the unfolding of a normal governmental procedure in accord with the rule of law. It was a totally different genre from a coup.""Of the Cline Center’s categories, Trump would presumably be referring to a ""counter coup,"" which is defined as involving ""the elimination of a usurper by members of the prior regime within a month of the initial coup.""But in Trump’s case, he didn’t take office through a coup (he was duly elected by the Electoral College) and the supposed counter-coup actually began before he actually won the presidency. So calling it a counter coup is problematic, too.""I cannot see in any way shape or form how this would be a coup in any reasonable sense of the word,"" said Richard Nephew, adjunct professor and senior research scholar at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. ""We have a long, historical legacy of holding to account our senior officials and representatives for their conduct.""Trump said the Russia investigation ""was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government.""The Russia investigation stemmed from a by-the-rules law enforcement inquiry. That’s far different than a coup, for which the defining characteristic is that it occurs outside the legal system. It’s also worth noting that the original investigation began before Trump had even been sworn in, meaning he wasn’t even eligible to be deposed by a coup.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Nick Schroer wrong that more women have died from legal abortions since Roe v. Wade,"On an episode of Politically Speaking, a podcast from St. Louis Public Radio, O’Fallon Rep. Nick Schroer spoke about legislation he sponsored known as the ""Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act"". The bill, which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat or brain activity is detected, is considered one of the ""strongest pro-life"" bills in the nation.Interviewer Jason Rosenbaum asked Schroer how he responds to opponents of his bill who say this will prompt women past the 6 to 8 week mark in their pregnancy when a heartbeat or brain activity could be detected to obtain a dangerous abortion.Schroer responded by saying statistics that measured the number of women who died from illegal abortions prior to the nationwide legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade in 1973 were fabricated and overestimated.Schroer said, ""There are statistics out there that show the number of women who died from illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade, that number has skyrocketed since with women dying more with legal abortions.""After further investigation, we found that Schroer’s claim was misleading.We reached out to Schroer to find out where he got the information about the number of women dying from legal abortions.In his reply, Schroer said, ""This quote was meant to pull in the numbers of female babies as well.""""Since Roe v. Wade, the number of babies killed, male and female, has skyrocketed per this information. Whether mother or female baby, the amount of life lost as a result of abortion since Roe has skyrocketed,"" he said.None of that is clear from Schroer’s answer on the podcast, and it has nothing to do with the question he was asked -- which was about pregnant women.So what do we know about outcomes of pregnant women seeking an abortion pre-Roe v. Wade? And have deaths of pregnant women seeking an abortion been increasing or decreasing?Karissa Haugeberg, assistant professor of history at Tulane University, said, ""It can be difficult to get at precise deaths due to illegal abortions because many physicians and pathologists obscured the cause of death on death certificates to protect providers and women’s families.""Many of these deaths would be reported as a miscarriage or other complication in the pregnancy.The Guttmacher Institute outlines the number of abortion deaths prior to Roe v. Wade, with abortion being the official cause of death for almost 2,700 women in 1930, 1,700 women in 1940 and over 300 women in 1950. The institute also says the actual number was likely much higher.In her book ""When Abortion Was a Crime,"" Leslie J. Reagan said, ""The same developments that finally reduced the mortality associated with childbirth reduced the mortality due to abortion."" Medical developments such as the use of blood transfusions and antibiotics made every medical procedure, including abortion, more safe. Antibiotics were widely introduced inAccording to the CDC, ""in 2014, the most recent year for which data were available, six women were identified to have died as a result of complications from legal induced abortion.""Schroer said the number of women dying from legal abortions has ""skyrocketed"" compared to illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.Schroer said he was talking about pregnant women and female fetuses, though that wasn’t the question he was asked and is extremely misleading to listeners. The number of women who have died from abortions has steadily decreased, even prior to the decision in Roe v. Wade.We rate this claim Pants On Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Jared Kushner wrong on scope of Russia’s interference,"Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, suggested Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia and whether the president obstructed justice was more disruptive to the country than Moscow’s election interference.Kushner’s entitled to his opinion on impact, but his characterization of Russia’s activity during the 2016 political season is wrong. ""Buying some Facebook ads to try and sow dissent"" is starkly at odds with the U.S. government’s description of the Kremlin’s ""active measures"" campaign, which officials concluded was carried out to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Ultimately, Mueller did not establish there was an illegal relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the notion that Moscow’s efforts amounted to ""a couple of Facebook ads"" is belied by the factual record Mueller compiled, as well as the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment.Russia’s active measures campaign comprised two major efforts. The first was a multi-platform social media campaign, which Kushner downplayed as the purchase of ""a couple of Facebook ads."" The second was the hacking and disseminating of Democratic materials to harm Clinton’s electoral chances.Mueller’s conclusion came after the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced a similar conclusion after the 2016 vote.The scope of Russia’s social media campaign went vastly further than Kushner’s claim of ""a couple of Facebook ads.""A Kremlin-backed entity called the Internet Research Agency, or IRA, ran the social media campaign out of St. Petersburg, Russia. Mueller found that by the end of the 2016 U.S. election, ""the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts.""The IRA purchased over 3,500 Facebook advertisements and spent some $100,000 on the political ads, the report states. The group also controlled multiple Facebook groups and Instagram accounts that ""had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants,"" Mueller said.About a year after the election, a Facebook executive told Congress that the IRA controlled some 470 accounts that generated 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017.But the biggest statistic concerns the length of its reach.""Facebook estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Facebook accounts,"" the Mueller report states.Their effort went well beyond Facebook. Additionally, the IRA controlled Twitter accounts with ""tens of thousands of followers,"" Mueller said, adding that among the followers were ""multiple U.S. political figures who retweeted IRA-created content.""Twitter later revealed the IRA controlled more than 3,800 accounts, and likely reached nearly 1.5 million Twitter users.Kushner’s description also ignored the Russian intelligence operation to steal and release documents.To help Trump’s odds, Russian hackers controlled by the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service, stole emails belonging to Democratic organizations and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and relayed them to several publishers, including WikiLeaks, Mueller concluded.Two WikiLeaks dumps of damaging Clinton material came at pivotal moments during the campaign.The first tranche — nearly 20,000 emails — revealed an embarrassing glimpse at internal deliberations among the Democratic National Committee. The correspondence appeared to show the party apparatus conspiring to boost Clinton and undermine her rival Bernie Sanders.The emails sparked Democratic infighting just as the party sought to coalesce support for Clinton.The next big WikiLeaks dump of damaging Clinton information came the month before the election, on Oct. 7.That afternoon, the Washington Post published video of a 2005 interview with Access Hollywood in which Trump boasted that his celebrity status enabled him to grope women.Less than an hour after the Trump tape went public, WikiLeaks revealed it had received 50,000 of Podesta’s emails. It released an initial dump of around 2,000 of the Clinton campaign chairman’s messages.The timing of the Podesta email release fueled suspicions that WikiLeaks wanted to distract from the Access Hollywood news. Nearly all of the Mueller report’s findings about WikiLeaks’ role is redacted.Kushner said Russia’s interference in the 2016 election amounted to ""a couple of Facebook ads.""This claim grossly mischaracterizes Russia’s active measures campaign, which comprised both social media efforts to help Trump’s candidacy and a hack-and-dump operation aimed at hampering Democrats’ electoral chances.On Facebook specifically, the tech company estimates Kremlin-controlled accounts reached as many as 126 million people around the election.We rate this Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, Donald Trump is not the first president with low approval amid a good economy","During an hours-long tweetstorm, President Donald Trump complained that he wasn’t getting enough credit for presiding over a strong economy.In the “old days” if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, “It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!We wondered whether Trump was right that historically, ""if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism."" (His mention of ""It's the economy, stupid,"" was something Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign team would say to remind themselves to stay on message.)Short answer: Trump is wrong.""Presidents have never been ‘immune’ to criticism, regardless of the economy,"" said Jeremi Suri, a historian at the University of Texas and its Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. ""From Washington to Trump, every president has faced serious criticism from domestic adversaries and various groups. That is as American as apple pie.""But even if you define the issue more broadly, Trump’s statement lacks evidence.For a quick-and-dirty analysis, we looked at two statistics that measure the strength of the economy and public support for every post-World War II president: the unemployment rate, and the president’s approval rating from the polling firm Gallup.We found four presidents -- Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush -- who experienced roughly similar low unemployment rates as Trump but whose approval percentages ranged from the low 20s to the high 30s.Here’s a summary:Truman’s strong-economy doldrums lasted for the better part of two years, Johnson’s for a year and a half, Nixon’s for a couple of months, and Bush’s for about six months.What they all shared is a major issue other than the economy that sapped public support.""If a president has a good economy, it gives them the chance to get a good approval rating -- but it’s not a guarantee,"" said Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Southern Methodist University Center for Presidential History.For Truman, Johnson and Bush, a war proved unpopular. For Nixon, it was Watergate.""War, when it is protracted, tends to be a downer for presidential approval,"" said Bert A. Rockman, an emeritus political science professor at Purdue University. ""All things being equal, a booming economy is a help to a president, unless they are caught up in conflicts that produce high numbers of casualties over a protracted period of time and that seem to be at an impasse.""Johnson faced problems beyond the Vietnam War. ""I think he could have survived the war if not for race riots and assassinations,"" Engel said. ""It wasn’t just one thing. It was the multiplicity of them.""Even presidents who maintain their approval ratings aren’t immune from ""criticism"" during good economic times, Suri said.Johnson and Bill Clinton ""were presidents during two of the best economic periods in post-war U.S. history, but both faced intensive criticism from Republicans and some Democrats,"" Suri said. ""The Republicans impeached Clinton at a moment of very low unemployment, strong economic growth, and even a budget surplus."" (Clinton’s approval rating on the eve of his impeachment vote in the House was 63 percent.)Low unemployment rates don’t guarantee that everyone will be happy with the economy, either, Suri added.""There is also the question of who benefits from good economic numbers,"" he said. ""Growing inequality, despite low unemployment, has been a source of criticism for all presidents since at least Nixon.""The White House did not respond to an inquiry.Trump said, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.""Even setting aside the constitutionally protected right of Americans to petition the government with their grievances, Trump lacks basic evidence for his assertion. At least four prior presidents served during good economic times yet had approval ratings lower than Trump’s are currently, usually because of wars or scandal.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

The video’s caption says: ""No workers present at the time that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire started......So who is this guy dressed in Muslim garb??""The person in the picture isn’t dressed in ""Muslim garb"" — the person is a firefighter.Because the clip used in the Facebook post is blurry, pixelated and cropped, it’s difficult to make out the firefighter's uniform or see the wider angle of water hoses being employed to the right of the tower.

The clip also doesn’t last long enough to show other firefighters who show up in the same area moments later, and is cropped to omit the water hoses being used to fight the fire.French authorities are conducting an investigation into the fire, but preliminary reports, so far, deem the cause as accidental, pointing to a possible link to the cathedral’s renovation project.We rate this Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the measles vaccine didn’t kill hundreds of infants last year","We asked Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute For Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, about the Facebook post.""It’s not true,"" he said.First, let’s look at measles deaths.Because the Facebook post claims measles has killed 11 people since 2000, a fraction of the number of people who died from measles globally, we’ll focus our fact-check on the United States.Benjamin Haynes, a spokesman for the CDC’s infectious disease media team, said three people have died from measles since 2000. Two people died in 2003, Haynes said, and one more died in 2015.Next, let’s look at the Facebook post’s claim that the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine killed 445 infants in one year, ""since 2018.""Haynes said the CDC doesn’t have precise data on deaths caused by the MMR vaccination.""CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitor reports of adverse events and deaths that occur after vaccination using several different systems including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),"" Haynes said. ""Since VAERS data cannot determine causality, we cannot use it to provide numbers of severe injuries or deaths caused by vaccination.""But, he added, ""a large body of evidence supports the safety of vaccines, and multiple studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and deaths except in rare cases.""Still, we wondered if 445 infants were reported dead in 2018 after they received the MMR vaccination.   The first case details the death of a 14-month-old boy. He was found dead in bed a week after vaccination, according to a write-up of the report. The cause of death was unknown.The second case details the death of a 1-year-old girl. The unknown reporter said the vaccine caused the girl to lose her speech and appetite and caused seizures. ""Upon internal review,"" the database says,"" seizure was determined to be medically significant."" The cause of death was unknown.The third case details the death of a 1-year-old boy. The cause of death was related to his seizure disorder.The authors summarized epidemiologic data on deaths after vaccination, including instances where reasonable scientific evidence existed to support that vaccination caused or contributed to deaths. Their conclusion? Millions of vaccinations are given to children and adults in the United States every year and serious adverse reactions from vaccines are uncommon. ""Deaths caused by vaccines are very rare,"" the paper says.  ""A review of VAERS data reveals that many of the death reports for MMR vaccine involved children with serious pre-existing medical conditions or were likely unrelated to vaccination,"" the paper continues. ""No concerning patterns have emerged that would suggest a causal relationship with the MMR vaccine and death.""We searched for news coverage of 445 infants dying from the MMR vaccine in a year. Such an event would draw media attention. But we couldn’t find any articles online, and when we searched the Nexis database for stories from Jan. 1, 2018 through April 11, 2019, about 445 deaths from measles vaccines, we couldn’t find anything to corroborate the Facebook post’s claim.The information in the Facebook post is wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Chicago isn’t ‘often bailed out’ by Illinois taxpayers","Illinois was settled from the south up, but the far northern Chicago region has come to dominate and that often frustrates Downstaters. Now, a group of Republican lawmakers say they want to change the dynamic by divorcing the rest of the state from its biggest city.In trying to make his case, Halbrook’s resolution repeats a well-worn claim about the city getting more than its fair share of state support.""The City of Chicago is often bailed out by taxpayers in the rest of the State, such as the $221 million bailout for the CPS pension system that was signed into law,"" it reads.Halbrook’s resolution goes a step further by contending the state is ""often"" footing the bill to break Chicago out of financial binds at the detriment of Downstate taxpayers. That’s a pretty tall order — and one the facts don’t even come close to backing up.We reached out to Halbrook, but he didn’t point us to any other cases he saw as bailouts beyond the pension help plus other aspects of the state’s school funding law he thinks give Illinois’ largest school district ""extra money.""So we contacted leading experts on the state’s political and economic history to see what they made of his claim.""It’s clearly not true in any fact-checking [sense],"" said John Jackson, a professor emeritus at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. ""It’s a very popular claim in Downstate Illinois and the further south you go, the more insistent it is.""Yet a majority of Downstate residents think they are getting the short end of the stick in a state dominated politically by Chicagoans, the report stated.Indeed, one of Halbrook’s co-sponsors raised the claim that Chicago gets a disproportionate share of road repair and construction money. But he did not provide any concrete evidence to back up that assertion and we could find nothing to suggest transportation funding might tip the balance of the distributions outlined in the institute’s report.Moreover, other experts we spoke with described Halbrook’s claim as ""total nonsense"" and dubiously ""grounded in any kind of reality."" One even called it a myth.""I think it’s very unfortunate that these politicians continue to pander to what amount to myths,"" said Mike Lawrence, a former director of the Paul Simon Institute who served as press secretary and senior policy advisor to Gov. Jim Edgar, a Downstate Republican who led Illinois for most of the 1990s. ""They talk about urban myths, and there may be such a thing as rural myths as well.""""That doesn’t mean that every dime that goes to Chicago is justified,"" Lawrence added. ""It also doesn’t mean that every dime that goes to Downstate is justified. But overall, the strength of the state, the ability to provide education and other services to people in the state are reliant on all sectors of the state.""Even one of Halbrook’s co-sponsors wouldn’t go so far as to defend the notion that Chicago is regularly receiving state bailouts.""This was more of a symbolic co-sponsorship for me,"" said state Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer of Jacksonville, the assistant House Republican leader. ""I didn’t write it. If I had written it, I probably would have written it a little differently because I do believe facts and reality are important.""Davidsmeyer, however, said he thinks lawmakers need to have a serious conversation about the ""Chicago-style policies that keep getting pushed down on the rest of the state.""Indeed, the resolution goes on to highlight the very different stances many Chicago and Downstate voters take on hot-button issues such as abortion, immigration and gun regulation, none of which have anything to do with economics or bailouts.Halbrook’s resolution claims that ""the City of Chicago is often bailed out by taxpayers in the rest of the State,"" pointing to the funding CPS received in 2017 to help cover its pension costs.We previously rated a similar claim False because the measure only provided CPS with financial support the state had long offered to all other districts in the state except Chicago.Halbrook also upped the ante by contending the money for CPS wasn’t an isolated incident, with the state ""often"" throwing a lifeline to Chicago taxpayers at the expense of those Downstate. He offered no evidence, however, and academic research has found the opposite is true.Experts we spoke with summed up the claim as a ""myth,"" ""clearly not true,"" and ""total nonsense.""

The speaker asserted that houses nearby were being torn down in order to provide homes for several hundred Syrian Muslim refugees, and that the area was going to be turned into a ""Sharia zone"" open only to Muslims.Here’s a portion of the video’s narration:""West Virginia’s $784 million in debt -- complete, absolute debt. Right here, they are building new houses where they have taken white folks and blacks folks and they’ve moved them down the road here to substandard housing conditions, so that 321 Syrian Muslims can move down into this neighborhood in two months when these are completed. This is going to cost us $87 million. You see that funeral home right there? It is to be torn down in two months and a mosque is going to be built there.

No money was transferred from Beto for Texas to the Texas Democrats after Election Day.Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, laughed when asked about the tweet and said any money transferred to the committee from O’Rourke went immediately into ongoing races across the state.""That money went straight to our field operations,"" he said.In fact, Garcia said the Texas Democrats did not make a contribution of any amount to O’Rourke’s presidential campaign durings its first 24 hours. He said it is rare for a party to give money directly to a candidate; instead it’s more likely to see a candidate contribute to the party.Our RulingPerez wrote on Twitter that O’Rourke ""gave the remaining $4.5+ mill from his Senate race to (The Texas Democratic Party) a few months ago, & the Party sent the money back to him on the day of his announcement.""O’Rourke transferred $4.5 million to the state’s Democratic party during the last month of his Senate campaign and party officials said the money was spent immediately to mobilize volunteers and voters.Political parties are not allowed to give more than $5,000 to a political candidate during an election.We rate this claim Pants on Fire.PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."

PANTS-FIRE,The Pants on Fire claim that two courts backed Trump's claim of no collusion with Russia," Sometimes people don’t wait for the fact-checkers to ask. Sometimes they just shout their corrections in real time.This happened on March 13, during remarks on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C.It came when Kevin Downing, the attorney for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, addressed reporters and onlookers moments after his client had been sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to an additional 43 months in prison for illegal lobbying and hiding the proceeds.The sentencing by Jackson was Manafort’s second in just a few days. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis earlier handed down a 47-month sentence in a separate case tried in Virginia.Observers on the scene were having none of it.""That’s not what she said!"" said someone as Downing continued speaking. ""You guys aren’t lawyers, man, you’re liars!""Really?We found that the hecklers were correct in saying that Downing misquoted and misinterpreted the judge’s words. (We reached out to Downing but didn’t hear back.)First, some background on why ""no collusion"" is an important point.One of the biggest arguments President Donald Trump has made in defending himself against investigations by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is that there was ""no collusion"" between the Trump campaign and agents of Russia.Read more: Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That’s not rightIf Trump could get a federal judge — or two — to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point.In her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the ""no collusion"" argument she read in the defense’s sentencing memorandum.""The ‘no collusion’ refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,"" she said, adding, ""The ‘no collusion’ mantra is simply a non sequitur.""She also said, ""The ‘no collusion’ mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing.""So, contrary to Downing’s remarks, Jackson didn’t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn’t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom.So what about Downing’s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the ""no collusion"" argument? That’s incorrect, too.""There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia,"" Downing said.Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!But that isn’t what Ellis said, either.Here’s the relevant portion of what Ellis said, according to the official court transcript: ""He is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.""To emphasize the point, Ellis repeated it shortly thereafter. ""He's not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election.""Downing said that Jackson ""conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.""Neither Jackson nor the judge in the other case, Ellis, said anything of the sort. To the contrary, they went out of their way to state the opposite. The street fact-checkers were right. We rate Downing’s statement Pants on Fire."

President Obama, from what they tell me, was under a similar kind of a thing — didn’t give one letter. They didn’t do anything. They didn’t give one letter of the request. Many requests were made; they didn’t give a letter.""Trump’s point that the Obama administration stonewalled all congressional demands for information is wrong.For the most part, the Obama administration did turn over documents demanded by lawmakers.Douglas Kriner, Schickler’s co-author and a government professor at Cornell University, said the push-pull dynamic over documents between the executive and legislative branches is as old as the republic, dating to investigations of a military disaster in the Ohio frontier under President George Washington.""So the Obama administration precedents are consistent with past practice,"" Kriner said. ""Any effort to cite them to justify mass-scale noncompliance with recent requests for documentation from the White House is disingenuous.""That said, the comparison between the Obama and Trump administrations is not entirely apples-to-apples.We’re not aware of any congressional investigations into Obama’s personal finances, as is happening to Trump. (Obama’s business and real estate holdings were trivial compared to Trump’s.) The four investigations outlined above tended to focus on activities of executive branch agencies rather than the White House itself.""I do not know of any major investigations of the Obama White House itself,"" said Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law professor who previously served as solicitor and deputy general counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives.When Elise J. Bean, a Wayne State law professor, worked for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations from 1999 to 2014 — a period that partially overlapped with Obama’s presidency — she didn’t recall ever sending a document request letter to the White House. By contrast, ""we sent lots of document requests to agencies like the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security.""The Trump White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Trump said that when Congress sought documents from Obama, the White House ""didn’t do anything. They didn’t give one letter of the request. Many requests were made. They didn’t give a letter.""That’s not what happened. The Obama administration gave hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress in at least four investigations. For a fraction of those documents, the administration went to court to try to head off the request, but courts generally sided with Congress, and the documents were ultimately handed over. Experts say the scenario is typical of the longstanding skirmishing between the executive and legislative branches.The documents handed over were mostly those of executive branch agencies, rather than the White House. In large part, that’s because questions never arose about Obama’s personal finances.Trump's claim is ridiculous— so we rate it Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Clinton on the hot seat with claim that thousands were turned away from the polls in Wisconsin,"More than two years after losing the 2016 presidential race to Republican Donald Trump, it seems Hillary Clinton is still focused on Wisconsin -- a state she narrowly lost.And one where she, quite notably, never campaigned during the general election.Her remarks were part of a program marking the 54th anniversary of the first march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Marchers that day were met and beaten by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as ""Bloody Sunday. ""In her comments, Clinton said this:""I was the first person who ran for president without the protection of the Voting Rights Act. I’ll tell you, it makes a really big difference. And it doesn’t just make a difference in Alabama and Georgia. It made a difference in Wisconsin, where the best studies that have been done said somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin, because of their age, because of whatever excuse could be made up to stop a fellow American citizen from voting.""The number is vital, since Trump defeated Clinton by 22,748 votes. She also narrowly lost Michigan and Pennsylvania -- and with those states, the presidency.Is Clinton correct about Wisconsin?Do studies show ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin"" and other factors?And was the lack of Voting Rights Act protections to blame?A familiar claimWe have looked at similar claims in the past -- including one from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and one from Clinton herself.We rated both Mostly False.And, though Clinton’s new claim is different, those items provide a good starting point.The 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which Wisconsin’s photo ID law was fully in effect.Comparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin.Had Wisconsin’s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin’s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent.Independent experts told us the methodology in the study was lacking.In one of our earlier items, we cited the perspective of Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee.""Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,"" he told us at the time. ""It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement.""Clinton’s claimIn making her new claim, Clinton attributed what happened in Wisconsin to the fact that the Voting Rights Act was no longer in effect. That refers to a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down Section 4 of the Act.The problem: Wisconsin was never one of the states covered by that section.Wisconsin was not one of the states covered by Section 4 when the court ruled in 2013, so, right off the bat, Clinton’s claim that this ""made a difference in Wisconsin"" is unfounded. Georgia was covered by Section 4, but Clinton’s claim that total voter registration declined in that state from 2012 to 2016 is false; it increased.The study focuses on those where were ""deterred"" from voting, which it defined as meaning the voters ""lack qualifying ID or mention ID as a reason for not voting. Voter ID could be a nominal reason or the primary reason for not voting.""We should note that Mayer told the Post that 14,000 is ""the equivalent of the most likely number"" of those deterred by the voter ID law.In any case, ""deterred"" is different than ""prevented"" or -- as Clinton phrased it -- ""turned away.""The study put a much smaller group in its stricter ""prevented"" category. It also warned against extrapolating the results from Milwaukee and Dane counties to the state as a whole. Yet that is just what Clinton did.So Clinton has problems on the low end of the range (40,000).Where does her high end number (80,000) come from?Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, told the Post it was based on the same Priorities USA study that was the basis for her earlier 200,000 estimate (the one we rated Mostly False). Merrill told the Post the 80,000 was a ""conservative estimate well within the range of the two studies.""Our ratingIn a speech, Clinton said because a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in effect, ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in Wisconsin) because of the color of their skin"" and other factors.She is wrong about the impact of the Voting Rights Act not being in effect. The provision in question never applied to Wisconsin.She also has problems with the numbers on both ends of her range.What’s more, the claim -- and others like it -- put all of the blame for people not voting on the state’s photo ID law. That ignores other factors, such as a lack of enthusiasm from voters, or the belief -- one apparently shared by candidate Clinton -- that the state was a safe one for her in 2016.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

But we found no evidence that it is Sanders.Sanders’ campaign spokesman Josh Orton told PolitiFact that Sanders never met with Castro or Guevara.Castro ruled Cuba for decades until 2008.

As the revolution radicalized, Boti was moved off center stage, but he remained loyal to the revolution, serving in a variety of positions until his death,"" he said.Professor Ted Henken, a Latino studies professor at Baruch College City College of New York, also confirmed that the photo is of Boti León.A cutline under a photo said that Bernie Sanders marched with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in Cuba.The same photo appeared on an entertainment website. A reverse image search showed that the historical photo includes Castro and Guevara at a 1959 parade in Havana, but we found no no evidence that Sanders is one of the men in the photo.Experts told us the man is Regino Boti León at a parade in 1960.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the 'Momo challenge' isn't real","Warnings about a terrifying cyberbullying threat called the ""Momo challenge"" have spread like wildfire on the internet over the last week.It’s been confusing for any parent who has dared to peek at social media in that time.That’s because news reports about the challenge warned parents that a ghoul-like figure known as ""Momo"" was targeting unsuspecting children through the internet and encouraging them to hurt themselves. Some stories even included interviews with parents who said their children had seen this Momo creature while they were online.But it didn’t take long for news reports to reconsider the online warnings their seemingly legitimate news stories seemed to be perpetuating: Did the threat of the ""Momo Challenge"" have any grain of truth to it? Or was it a fear-preying hoax gone viral?We will cut to the chase: It’s all hype and hoax.Try as we did, we could not find the actual ""challenge"" itself online. The only content that we found are the warning posts being shared by frightened parents, and news stories about it. Still, swaths of parents are claiming that they, or their kids, have seen Momo appear.While we couldn’t find the challenge on any platform, it doesn’t mean reinvented versions of the hoax won’t pop up. Unfortunately, pranksters, cyber bullies and copycats pick up on viral trends like this one, using them to frame their own set of challenges. Regardless, there is no evidence the threat is real.Depending on what you read, the challenge can take several forms. This is common when viral crazes spread at a rapid rate.The warnings claim the character cuts into kids programs on YouTube and asks the viewer to text a phone number (sometimes using the WhatsApp application) that appears on the screen. Other warnings claim that contact is initiated by the participant when they search for the special phone number online and then send a text or WhatsApp message.Whichever way contact is made, the gaunt doll supposedly asks the viewer to complete challenges that may include waking up in the middle of the night to hurt themselves or others -- and, the claim goes, may even tell the viewer to commit suicide.As the social media warnings multiplied, it didn’t take long for the viral story to catch on with news media in the United States.The startling Momo image has become so recognizable due to the viral nature of this post, it would not be a stretch for a child to tell their parents that they have heard or seen Momo. Nor would it be unusual if a child reported finding the creature scary. That does not, however, mean that the child interacted with Momo online in the manner described in these online warnings.One upside to the Momo craze is that it may be spurring needed conversation among parents about their children’s internet use and the subjects that they are exposed to online.""It’s important that parents talk to their children about it. The best way to start is to ask a general question about whether they have seen anything online that upset or worried them,"" the organization said. ""Explain that there are often things that happen online that can be misleading or frightening and that some things are designed to get a lot of attention.""""The upshot from many of the Momo stories is to tell parents to talk with their kids about problem content,"" he wrote. ""So, in essence, I think the matter can get too focused on making content better when in fact a lot of it is so compelling or potentially addictive for kids that they refuse to do much else.""We want to clear something up regarding the Momo Challenge: We’ve seen no recent evidence of videos promoting the Momo Challenge on YouTube. Videos encouraging harmful and dangerous challenges are against our policies.Any Momo-related content -- meaning even videos warning people about Momo -- is now being marked on the platform as ""identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences."" If a restricted mode is placed on a child’s account, this content will not show up.Warning posts and news accounts flooding social media warn parents about the ""Momo Challenge,"" saying it is infiltrating kids’ programs online and encourages them to harm themselves or others.Some version of the challenge may exist now, with cyberbullies or copycats picking up on the viral trend, but there is no evidence to support that this challenge is real and there has been no confirmed link between the game and any deaths.Child psychologists and internet safety groups say the most important thing for parents to do is to consistently monitor their children’s internet use and to communicate frequently about the content their children are encountering online.We rate this internet rumor Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Meme wrong about Somali-Americans in Ilhan Omar's district,"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., hasn’t been in Congress long, but she has already inspired controversy among both Republicans and Democrats.In one case, she tweeted that support for Israel in Congress is ""all about the Benjamins."" A Republican motion to condemn anti-Semitism, widely seen as a rebuke of her comment, passed the House, 424-0, and she apologized.A few weeks later, however, Omar said at a public event, ""I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country."" This led the House Democratic leadership to pursue another vote denouncing anti-Semitism.Amid the controversy, Omar has become a target for conservatives on social media.The Minneapolis area is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, hub for Somali-Americans in the country, and many of them came as refugees. Omar herself came to the United States as a refugee in 1995.However, the post is wrong on multiple levels.As it turns out, 6,320 refugees from Somalia were resettled in Minnesota between 2009 and 2017, when Obama served as president. That’s about one-seventh of the amount claimed in the meme.That’s fewer than the number settled in Minnesota during the final seven years of the George W. Bush presidency. From 2002 to 2008, the government resettled 9,858 Somalis in Minnesota.During the Obama years, 54,514 Somali refugees were resettled nationally, meaning that Minnesota accounted for about 11.5 percent of the national total.During the Bush years, the national total was 46,439, making Minnesota’s share higher under Bush than it was under Obama, at 21.2 percent.The bureau’s five-year estimate found between 42,400 and 55,200 Somalis living in Minnesota, in 13,000 to 16,500 households.""Numbers vary, largely because of census undercounts and secondary migration that might not document people properly,"" said Stefanie Chambers, a Trinity College political scientist who has studied the Somali-American community in the United States.So was the Somali-American electorate in the district the main reason she won the all-important primary? We don’t have exact figures, but we were able to reverse-engineer some answers.According to the refugee resettlement data, we found that the major jurisdictions of the 5th district -- mainly Minneapolis, but a few others as well -- received roughly half of the Somali refugees who were resettled in the state under both Bush and Obama.If we use the high end of the Census Bureau’s statewide estimate for Somali Americans in Minnesota -- 55,200 -- then this means the 5th district was probably home to about 27,600 Somali Americans.So, Omar won more than 65,000 primary votes in a district that likely had about 27,600 Somali-Americans. This means she had to have won tens of thousands of votes from non-Somalis.And even this probably overstates the impact of Somali-American voters.Not all of the 27,600 Somalis in the district are able to vote, since Minnesota’s Somali population skews young.In addition, even those who were eligible to vote may not have turned out at the polls. The district as a whole saw only 18.8 percent of the population turn out to vote in the primary. If the district’s Somali population turned out at that rate, no more than about 5,000 Somali voters would have cast a primary ballot.And 5,000 votes would have been less than one-tenth of Omar’s primary vote total, and only about one-fifth of her margin of victory.The idea that Omar’s victory was preordained by demographics is ridiculous.No one forced the voters of the 5th congressional district of Minnesota to vote for Omar. As we’ve shown, the pattern of Somali settlement in Minnesota long predated Obama’s tenure in the White House. So the viral image has no grounds for singling out Obama.The viral image said, ""Obama settled 43,000 Somalian refugees in Minnesota. As of 2016, there were around 80,000. No wonder Ilhan Omar was elected. It was planned.""The meme significantly overstates the number of Somali refugees settled under Obama in Minnesota, the total number of Somali refugees in the state, and the impact that Somali voters could have had on the primary election results, much less the lopsided general election. In no way can Omar’s victory have been ""planned,"" by Obama or anyone else.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

""But so, too, is addressing the social and racial justice aspect of marijuana use. Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate in the country for Black men, and drug-related crimes account for as many as 75-85 percent of all inmates in our prisons.""That’s a really high number.Given all the possible actions that could land a person in prison, do drug crimes really account for three-quarters or more of all inmates?The Wisconsin Department of Corrections uses a number of measures to track how inmates landed behind bars. But none of them are anywhere close to Evers’ number.The numbers are even lower when examining only the most serious offense for each inmate — in other words the one most likely responsible for the length of their prison stay. Only 11 percent of inmates in 2017 had a drug offense as their most serious charge.By comparison, a violent crime was the most serious charge for 66 percent of offenders, and a property crime for 14 percent.So where did Evers get his number?Ellwanger used the stat in the context of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study that found Wisconsin had the highest rates of incarceration in the nation for black residents. But he was wrong.""Upon further investigation, the claim as reported in the WUWM article above did not appear to have sufficient substantiation, and it should have been removed from our document,"" Baldauff said in an email.

That is where Preckwinkle’s ad picks up.In the ad, Mendoza’s line about how she could administer the death penalty ""‘...and sleep like a baby at night…’"" is emphasized with text. What both the edited footage and those ellipses leave out, however, is that she was referring only to cases where she knew ""without a doubt"" that a convicted criminal was ""a cop killer or a serial murderer.""The ad also cuts off Mendoza’s remarks a sentence before she reaches her main point — that too many people on death row in Illinois had later been found innocent.""This debate for me is no longer about whether or not guilty killers deserve to die for their crimes, they do deserve to die,"" Mendoza said, according to the debate transcript, just as she does in the ad.

I'm not OK with that and none of us should be OK with that,"" she said at the time.The problem of course is that Mendoza, in the remarks the Preckwinkle ad chose to omit, specifically refers to those wrongful convictions as the reason she had changed her mind about the death penalty.""Mendoza, despite her vote in 2011, gave testimony at that same time saying she still believed in the death penalty, and that she could administer the death penalty herself and sleep like a baby at night,"" Trevino added. ""The ad was reflective of her extreme values on this issue.""With highly selective editing, Preckwinkle’s ad uses video clips from a speech Mendoza gave on the Illinois House floor in 2011 in which she declares opposition to the death penalty to leave the impression that she actually remained an enthusiastic supporter of it.While it is true that a decade earlier Mendoza backed an expansion of the death penalty, the speech from which the clips are taken made an entirely different point. She had changed her mind and wanted to end capital punishment in Illinois because the state had sentenced too many people to death row that later had been found innocent. Indeed, Mendoza then voted for a measure that abolished the death penalty.None of that footage or context was used in the ad, which grossly misrepresents Mendoza’s position.

Northam, a Democrat, apologized for the photo on Feb. 1, then later claimed neither man is him.In North Carolina, similar racist images in the 1979 UNC yearbook emerged on social media. At least one political activist, prompted by a story published in a British news organization, tried to tie the blackface scandal to the N.C. Governor’s Mansion.Here are the facts, as of Feb. 8:To detect fake news, readers can look for specific things when they encounter questionable claims. In this case, the false claim about Cooper apparently evolved from a misleading headline.Here’s how it happened.A TWEETED PHOTOOne of the photos shows two white students dressed in white hooded robes like those worn by the Ku Klux Klan. The students are holding onto a noose that was around the neck of another white student, who was covered in blackface makeup.Chi Psi was known for being inclusive and had several black members at the time, according to Brad Kutrow, a lawyer in Charlotte who on Feb. 8 spoke with News & Observer reporter Jane Stancill.A MISLEADING HEADLINEAlthough the headline doesn’t specifically say the governor was in the controversial photos, readers could interpret it to mean he was. A subheadline says, ""Cooper was in the different Chi Psi fraternity did not feature on their pages,"" but that subheadline is in smaller font.In the ninth paragraph, the Daily Mail reports: ""Cooper was a member of a different fraternity, Chi Psi, and while the 61-year-old from Nashville is indeed pictured in his yearbook edition, he does not feature on his frat page according to a list of students who don’t appear.""

The same, it seems, with the Challenger disaster.The post reads: ""They didn’t die in 1986. I just found Astro-NOT Judith Resnik by searching Yale’s website just moments ago."" Pictures of the crew are attached, with side-by-side comparisons with their so-called dopplegangers.The Facebook post also links a YouTube video from 2016 that highlights the doppelgangers while ""The Twilight Zone"" theme song plays.This is an example of conspiracy theorists combining a few suggestive aspects in an attempt to prove a monumental, and well-documented event, was faked. To say the evidence is not conclusive would be an understatement.The rumor’s only evidence is that at least six of the seven crew members (excluding Gregory Jarvis) have lookalikes with identical or similar names who are around the approximate ages that the crew members would be if they were alive today.There are a few problems with this thinking.First, most of these doppelgangers have very different backgrounds and were in very different locations, professional roles, and institutions than that of the crew members prior to the disaster.The same woman couldn’t have been working different jobs, in different geographic locations, at the same time.Third, some of the lookalikes do not actually resemble the crew members, with different facial structures and characteristics, and seem selected to simply try to help prove the conspiracy.Lastly, for a major national conspiracy supposedly orchestrated by NASA, it is highly improbable the crew would be living openly, under the same names and with no physical disguises in place.All four found, though, match the crew members’ dates of birth and death, and the states in which their Social Security cards were issued.A social media post claims that the 1986 Challenger space shuttle crew members are alive and well, and the tragedy was a hoax orchestrated by NASA.To suggest that NASA staged the deaths, for no particular reason, and then allowed the crew to openly live out their lives with no name changes or physical disguises is highly unlikely. Also, for something so out-in-the-open, it wasn’t noticed until nearly 30 years later.Moreover, death certificates and the backgrounds of the ""lookalikes"" directly contradict the core of the conspiracy theory.This false rumor disgraces the crew’s legacy and is based on assumptions loosely tied together.This is Pants on Fire!'"

PANTS-FIRE,"Pants on Fire: Robin Vos, Scott Fitzgerald blame Tony Evers for Foxconn changes","The size and scope of Foxconn Technology Group’s planned complex in Racine County is suddenly up for debate, months after the Taiwanese firm signed contracts with state and local officials for billions in public funding.All that left Foxconn — a longtime political football — subject to a fresh round of kicks.Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat sworn in a mere three weeks earlier.""We don’t blame Foxconn for altering plans in an ever-changing technology business. It’s also not surprising Foxconn would rethink building a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin under the Evers Administration,"" the statement read in part. ""The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration. Governor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda and pledged to do away with a successful business incentive for manufacturing and agriculture.""Is Foxconn really making changes in reaction to ""economic uncertainty"" created by the state’s newly-minted governor?Let’s review what we know.This was a fast-moving story, with different accounts of Foxconn’s reported leanings coming from different sources across several days.But in the middle of that, Vos and Fitzgerald made a very specific and concrete claim: that Foxconn was reacting to uncertainty Evers caused.When we asked Vos and Fitzgerald to back up their claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer noted a series of changes in Evers’ economic policy positions over time. But she said Republicans had no direct evidence connecting Foxconn’s changes to Evers or any action by the new governor.""The leaders believe that is the case,"" she said.Meanwhile, Foxconn hasn’t explicitly laid out its current plans or the reasoning behind them — but several reports have pointed to market factors rather than political ones.Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou, voiced concern over the cost of making advanced TV screens in the U.S. due to labor expenses that exceed those in other countries, Reuters reported.The Nikkei story, citing unnamed sources, said plans are on hold due to the trade war between China and the U.S. and uncertainty over demand. Apple is of particular concern, as the top Foxconn customer announced a revenue downgrade this month due to lagging sales.Nikkei claimed the Wisconsin delay was ""as a result of negotiations with new Gov. Tony Evers,"" citing a company document. But its article did not quote from the document or provide additional details.In any case, Foxconn disputed the Nikkei report and spoke positively of Evers.""The company remains committed to its long-term investment and creating 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin,"" the company said in a statement issued Jan. 31, 2019. ""All interactions to date with Governor Evers and his team have been constructive, and we look forward to further discussions as we continue to invest in American talent and broaden the base of our investment within the State of Wisconsin.""Hogan was appointed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who helped negotiate the deal.""I have been involved with the Foxconn project from day one, and there never have been any side deals and the contract stands on its own,"" Hogan said Jan. 31, 2019. ""In addition, there have been no attempts by either the company or the Evers’ or Walker administrations to renegotiate WEDC’s contract.""Aside from what has been reported, there are many other things that undermine the argument that Foxconn is responding to Evers.Experts say it simply wouldn’t make sense for Foxconn — a major global player —  to take action in response to a governor who was just sworn in Jan. 7, 2019.Nolette said slowing iPhone sales and the trade war are more likely factors in what exactly Foxconn builds and operates in Wisconsin.The statement by Vos and Fitzgerald expanded on the ""economic uncertainty"" claim by pointing to Evers’ pledge to eliminate a business incentive.What’s more, there are contradictory aspects in Vos and Fitzgerald’s own statement.Vos and Fitzgerald say they understand Foxconn changing its plans ""in an ever-changing technology business,"" but then blame Evers for causing changes.They say Foxconn is changing due to Evers, but then note Foxconn hasn’t pulled back on its pledge to create 13,000 new jobs.""You can see kind of a disconnect there,"" Nolette said. ""They’re saying it’s Evers’ fault that the bad things are happening, but really things aren’t that bad because the contract is still in place.""Which brings us to an important point — the state has a signed contract in place with Foxconn. It establishes up to $4 billion in cash payments and tax breaks over 15 years in exchange for building the manufacturing facility and creating 13,000 jobs.Republican leaders Vos and Fitzgerald said in a joint statement that potential changes in Foxconn’s Wisconsin plans are a result of ""economic uncertainty"" created by Evers — who has been governor for less than a month.A spokeswoman for Vos offered no evidence of that claim, saying merely that the leaders ""believe"" that is the case.Meanwhile, the evidence against the claim is steep:Published reports attribute the potential changes to an array of market and economic factors, including labor costs in the U.S., declining consumer demand and the trade war with China. Experts say those are historically the kinds of factors that drive business decisions, not politics.Foxconn’s lone public statement on the matter says talks with Evers have been ""constructive.""And the CEO of WEDC says Evers has not interfered in the Foxconn contract in any way.All of which makes Vos and Fitzgerald’s claim not only wrong, but ridiculous. That’s our definition of Pants on Fire. "

While it does discuss that some of these families may misrepresent their income to receive more, it isn’t relevant to the claim that ""18 million"" just received a government check.In our research we found that, no, 18 million illegal immigrants did not receive a check from the government amid the shut down.Here’s how we know.As of 2016, the most recent data available, the report found the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country decreased to 10.7 million from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007.Taking either figure into account, it would be impossible for 18 million undocumented immigrants to receive checks from the government, because there are only approximately 11 million living in the country.We spoke with Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute.""Obviously, unauthorized immigrants themselves are hardly eligible for any government assistance that it’s hard to know what they would be getting checks for,"" Capps said.""Their children who are born in the U.S. may be eligible for emergency Medicaid, but that is not the majority.... And as far as food stamps go, most illegal immigrants are ineligible for that. If they are receiving them, it’s only a fraction of the population and it isn’t for themselves it’s for their children, and again that’s not a check.""The mathematical misstep may have stemmed from lumping the number of legal immigrants into the equation.Another report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low levels of immigration, estimated that in 2012, of the number of  households headed by immigrants who are in the country illegally, 4 percent used housing programs.Viral Facebook posts are claiming that 18 million illegal immigrants received a government check this month, while federal workers remain unpaid amid the government shutdown.We could not find any evidence that supports this figure, and multiple reports put the total number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. far lower than 18 million.Moreover, illegal immigrants are barred from receiving most federal benefits, and primarily will benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"Yes, Kamala Harris is eligible to run for president","California Sen. Kamala Harris had barely become a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination before birther accusations started on Twitter.Some have raised questions about whether the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., or Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, could have served as president. McCain was born to U.S. parents in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was stationed there in the military. Cruz was born in Canada to U.S. parents.We tweeted at Wohl, who didn’t respond by publication time. However, when we checked in with four legal scholars with expertise in this question, they all agreed that Wohl’s ""serious questions"" are a red herring.A Harris campaign spokesman, Ian Sams, told PolitiFact, ""Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, which is, was, and presumably will be in the United States of America. End of story.""Sams refused to provide any additional information about Harris’ parents’ naturalization status, or about her time in Canada. But she has spoken or written about these topics previously, so we’ll recap the story here.She was born in 1964 to Donald Harris, a Jamaican-born economist, and Shyamala G. Harris, a scientist.Shyamala Gopalan, meanwhile, was born in Chennai, in southern India, and she graduated from the University of Delhi at 19. She applied to a graduate program at Berkeley to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology, on her way to becoming a breast cancer researcher.Harris’s parents met at Berkeley and soon married. The couple separated around the time the future senator was five, and they divorced a few years later, Harris wrote in her book.Harris continued to live in California until she was in middle school, when her mother was offered a position in Montreal teaching at McGill University.Harris wrote of being unhappy about the distance from her home, about the cold weather, and about having to navigate the city in a language she barely knew. But ""by the time I got to high school, I had adjusted to our new surroundings,"" she wrote.Harris, left Montreal to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C. She became the junior senator from California in 2017.This makes for an interesting personal history. But contrary to Wohl’s tweet, it is completely irrelevant for determining Harris’ eligibility to run for president.So the key language is whether Harris is a ""natural born citizen."" And experts say she meets that definition.""If you are born in the U.S, you are automatically a natural-born U.S. citizen under the constitution,"" said Harvard Law Professor Einer Elhauge.Sarah Duggin, a Catholic University law professor, agreed. ""Her birth in the United States, to someone other than a member of a foreign diplomatic corps or otherwise not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, makes her a U.S. citizen unless she later renounced her citizenship. There is no reason to look at where her parents came from, how long her parents were U.S. residents before she was born, or where she was raised.""Two other law professors with expertise in this area -- Mary Brigid McManamon of Widener University and Malinda L. Seymore of Texas A&M University -- agreed that Harris is clearly eligible.Wohl tweeted, ""Kamala Harris is NOT eligible to be President,"" based on ""serious questions"" concerning her parents’ naturalization status and her time spent growing up in Canada.Constitutional scholars agree that rehashing details of Harris’ upbringing is a smokescreen, since the only factor that matters is that Harris was born in the United States. The 14th Amendment, an 1898 Supreme Court decision and a 1952 statute make clear that anyone born in the United States is qualified to run for president.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Claim about Nancy Pelosi bar tab is baseless,"Game show host-turned-conservative pundit Chuck Woolery appeared to rehash a nearly decade-old falsehood about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., racking up outsize bar tabs on taxpayer dollars while shuttling between Washington and California.Pelosi’s air travel did make headlines recently — but not for the reason Woolery suggested.Woolery posted his tweet the same day Trump denied Pelosi the use of military aircraft.We found zero evidence to back up this claim. Furthermore, the congresswoman doesn’t drink, Pelosi’s office said.The original source of Bachmann's allegation was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues. A spokesman for Woolery sent us the same set of documents when we asked for evidence. But in neither case do they back up the speakers’ assertions.In Bachmann's case, she cited a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to a much larger number — $101,429 — for all non-plane costs of the trip. It’s unclear how Woolery came up with his $52,000 annual figure. Neither is correct.Pelosi’s office told us in 2010 — and reiterated for this check — that she ""does not drink alcohol."" An aide added that she no longer takes weekly flights via military aircraft, a once-common practice that has since been phased out. She now travels commercial between Washington and California.Woolery said, ""Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her flights from Washington to San Fran every week? We pay for it. 1000 dollars.

Use ATM’s in public, well-lit areas, like inside banks or supermarkets.• Be aware of your surroundings. If you notice anything out of the ordinary or suspicious cancel your transaction and leave immediately. You can come back later or find another ATM.• If it looks like someone has tampered with the ATM equipment in any way, don’t use it and report it.• Type in your pin discreetly and shield the screen and keypad so others can’t see.• Put your cash, card and receipt away immediately. Count your money later where others can’t see and avoid showing your cash.• Take your receipts with you so potential criminals will not know how much you withdrew or how much money is in your account.• When using a drive-up ATM, keep your doors locked, windows up and your engine running.• When using an enclosed ATM that requires your card to open the door, avoid letting anyone follow you inside.• While many ATMs are available 24 hours a day, try to go during the day.

PANTS-FIRE,Roger Roth incorrectly says lame duck bills didn’t take any power from governor or attorney general,"After taking it on the chin from Democrats in the fall 2018 election, Republicans passed a litany of last-minute bills in December.The lame-duck actions — approved in a special session of the Legislature and signed by outgoing Gov. Scott Walker — changed a variety of things, in many cases giving the GOP-held Legislature control over matters previously left up to the governor and attorney general.Democrats Tony Evers and Josh Kaul unseated Republican incumbents to take over those two offices. They were sworn in Jan. 7, 2019.Some Republican leaders were up front about their reasoning. For instance, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said without those protections Evers could take actions counter to what Republicans believed in.""The end result here is there will be more legislative oversight in a lot of areas, but no power was taken away from the governor,"" said Roth, R-Appleton. ""Power was not taken away from the attorney general.""Just some common sense oversight measures put into place.""That’s a very different tune. And a clear and bold claim.Did the lame-duck actions really take away no power from the two incoming Democrats?Asked for backup, Roth spokeswoman Angela Roidt said the powers of the governor and attorney general are spelled out in the state Constitution, and that wasn’t changed. So, she said, their powers were not affected by the bills.Roidt also argued the bills only affected ""legislative oversight."" But power and oversight are generally a zero-sum game — if one entity is gaining it, another is losing.• Gave the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board the power to appoint the head of the agency, a power previously given to the governor.

PANTS-FIRE,Meme way off in claim that the Rothschild family holds '80 percent of the world's wealth',"Memes pushing an old rumor about the Rothschilds, the influential European banking family, are making the rounds online.It is true that the Rothschilds are quite wealthy – they have been since the 1700s – but to suggest they are in possession of 80 percent of the world’s wealth is a gross exaggeration.Mayer then dispatched each of his five sons to a different European city – London, Paris, Vienna, Naples and Frankfurt – to set up shop.The family’s dealings with various governments and savvy investments paid off handsomely, helping them establish a financial dynasty.While the Rothschilds certainly still have deep pockets, they have produced hundreds of descendants and there is no longer any centralized family wealth, nor does the family have the same kind of global power it did in the 18th and 19th centuries.The closest thing to a ""Rothschild’s family"" business today is the Rothschild Group, a multinational investment banking company. But the enterprise does not produce nearly enough money to back up the claim that the family controls 80 percent of the world’s money supply.""Make no mistake, it's a large and successful company; but with billions in assets, it's a relatively small fish in the sea of world financial institutions with trillions in assets,"" Dunning said then, ""including Deutsche Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas, Japan Post Bank, Crédit Agricole Group, Barclays PLC, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Royal Bank of Scotland Group, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and many others. Anyone trying to point the finger at the scattered Rothschilds as ‘controlling’ world banks has an awfully tall order. That little factoid is about 100 years out of date.""A meme recirculating the internet claims the Rothschild family ""holds about 80 percent of the world’s wealth,"" and thus has the ability to ""feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child"" if they so choose.The family is certainly wealthy but claiming they control 80 percent of the world’s wealth is a tall order. There is no longer any centralized family wealth, with the closest being an investment banking firm. But the firm’s revenues are far less than what many corporations make.The rumor is a baseless exaggeration that furthers the spread of anti-Semitic theories.We rate it Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Trump gets facts wrong on Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,"President Donald Trump attempted to rewrite history by claiming that the reason for the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was to defeat terrorists entering Russia.While fielding questions from White House reporters about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, Trump revisited Russia’s Cold War-era occupation of the country.  Documentary evidence shows Russia invaded Afghanistan as part of a broader Cold War strategy. But is there anything to Trump’s claim that terrorism was what motivated Moscow?Historians say no.""There have never been any terrorist attacks from Afghanistan in Russia from the creation of the universe until now,"" said Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation.""A few Chechens and Arabs who went to Chechnya participated in acts of terror in the 1990s,"" he added. ""None of them came from Afghanistan to do so, though some may have been there at one time, and not a single Afghan has ever been involved.""In other words, Trump’s retelling of Russia’s invasion is completely mistaken.""The Soviet Union’s primary motivation to invade Afghanistan was to balance against a perceived growing U.S. interest in Afghanistan in the late 1970s,"" said Seth Jones, a political scientist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It was about cold, calculating balance-of-power politics.""Moscow and Washington competed for sway over Afghanistan beginning in the 1950s. Its value as a Cold War bargaining chip lay in the fact that it was the Soviet Union’s southern neighbor, with the two sharing a nearly 1,500-mile border.But over the following decades the rivalry grew more tense as Afghan politics frayed.The Soviet Union viewed Afghanistan as part of its natural sphere of influence, while the United States saw it as the Soviet regime’s ""soft underbelly,"" in the words of former U.S. diplomat Graham Fuller.In fall 1979, Soviet leadership grew increasingly worried that a new Afghan leader, Hafizullah Amin, was too amenable to Western influence. Or worse, that he was an agent of the CIA.The KGB warned the Politburo that Amin might turn to the United States for help with tamping down his country’s lingering civil unrest.In early December, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev convened his inner circle to discuss options, amid growing fears that the United States was increasingly eyeing Afghanistan.Soviet leadership decided to have the KGB depose Amin and replace him with Babrak Karmal, one of the leaders of the far-left April Revolution of the previous year. Brezhnev and his advisers also weighed deploying a large-scale contingent of troops to stabilize the country.By Dec. 27, 1979, Soviet forces numbered 50,000, with 5,000 troops and special forces positioned around the Afghan capital of Kabul, according to Jones’ account. Covert KGB forces launched an assault on the presidential palace where Amin and his security guards were located.""Amin’s guards fought back for several hours,"" Jones wrote, ""but they were ultimately overcome, and KGB forces assassinated Amin.""In his place, Soviets installed their hand-picked successor, Babrak Karmal, who would lead Afghanistan for 7 years. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan wore on for even longer, ultimately ending in defeat in February 1989.It’s possible Trump conflated several details related to the Soviet-Afghan conflict.Trump said, ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia.""The Soviet Union’s motivation for invading Afghanistan was about Cold War balance-of-power politics. At no point has Afghanistan served as a launchpad for terrorist attacks in Russia, historians said.We rate this Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"No, 18 children didn't die in U.S. border protection custody under Obama","The Trump administration’s immigration policies have received even more scrutiny after an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy died while in U.S. border protection custody on Christmas Eve. He was the second migrant child to die in U.S. custody within a month.Some of President Donald Trump’s supporters are lashing back at the criticism, pointing to migrant children deaths that supposedly occurred under the Obama administration.We found no evidence to suggest that 18 children died in U.S. custody at the border during Obama’s two presidential terms.In the statement, Nielsen also stated it’s been over 10 years since a child died in U.S. border security custody.""To put this in perspective, there were six migrant deaths while in CBP (Customs Border Protection) custody during (fiscal year) 2018 – none whom were children,"" Nielsen said.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump wrong on size and timing of military pay increases,"During a holiday visit to troops stationed in Iraq, President Donald Trump bragged that he had secured them not only their first pay raise in over a decade, but ""one of the biggest"" ever.This is inaccurate and not the first time Trump has made false claims about annual military raises.""..you just got one of the biggest pay raises you’ve ever received ...

Service members have received pay increases every year, as mandated by federal law, for over three decades and the 2019 increase is set at 2.6 percent.Even if Trump meant that members hadn’t received that large of a raise in over a decade, that would also be false.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, three Muslim congresswomen did not 'refuse' to take the oath - the ceremony hasn't happened yet","Supporting the U.S. Constitution and its amendments is probably the most agreed upon tenet in politics today, though politicians commonly accuse one another of trying to undermine the text.In just one day, the inflammatory post garnered over 70 comments and has been shared more than 3,000 times.The full meme:""If you refused to sign an oath of office to uphold the U.S. Constitution, as every other holder of that office is required to do, you should not be allowed to serve … Three Muslim congresswomen just refused.""There are two problems with this claim. First, at the start of each new Congress, all members beginning a new term of office are actually required to take an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution. So, they can’t refuse.Second, no members could have refused because the swearing-in ceremony (when the oath is taken) hasn’t happened yet.In the federal government, in order for an official to take office, he or she must first take the oath of office, which is also known as the swearing-in ceremony.Oaths are taken in all three branches of government, including the president, vice president, Congress members and Supreme Court justices.It reads:I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.""Today, members of Congress take the oath to uphold the Constitution en-masse in a public, group swearing-in ceremony on the opening day of a new Congress.The ceremony consists of members raising their right hands and repeating the oath. No religious texts are used (as specified in the Constitution). Some members pose for photos individually following the official swearing-in and hold private ceremonies.Since the 80th Congress, (1947-49) members have also been required to sign an oath.The 116th U.S. Congress is set to convene on Jan. 3, 2019, and representatives and senators take their oath during the first day of a new Congress.Since the swearing-in has yet to take place, no members would have been able to refuse to take or sign the oath of office, as the meme implies.Looking for one more reason that this claim is a hoax? There will not be three Muslim women serving in Congress in 2019, like the post claimed.There will be two. Michigan elected Rashida Tlaib, and Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar.They will be the first to Muslim women to serve in Congress.A popular meme says politicians shouldn’t be allowed to serve if they refuse to take an oath of office and that ""three Muslim congresswomen refused.""Each new member of Congress, along with the president, vice president and Supreme Court justices, are required to take the oath of office when they are sworn in, as written in the U.S. Constitution.The 116th Congress will convene after the holiday break, on Jan. 3, 2019, which is when incoming representatives and senators will take their oath – so no member could have refused yet.This claim is Pants on Fire!"

Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!""Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!There are some major factual problems with Trump’s claim, we found.First, a new report from the Justice Department’s internal watchdog suggests the roughly 19,000 messages slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI’s data-collection tool on Samsung devices, not because Strzok and Page went around the system.The inspector general was unable to recover text messages Strzok and Page may have sent using iPhones they were given when they joined Mueller’s team. But a special counsel official who reviewed Strzok’s iPhone before it was reset found it contained no substantive messages.There is no evidence the text messages show the special counsel investigation is a ""hoax.""We reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear backAs part of its inquiry, the Office of Inspector General collected texts exchanged between Strzok and Page, some of which showed hostility toward Trump and a preference for Clinton. (Strzok was later fired from from the FBI and Page has since left.)The inspector general found no evidence Strzok and Page tried to prevent the FBI from collecting their texts.The watchdog’s findings suggest the most likely reason the texts weren’t captured had to do with technical flaws in the FBI’s data-collection process, not deliberate wrongdoing.It concluded: ""The OIG investigation determined that the FBl's collection tool was not only failing to collect any data on certain phones during particular periods of time, it also does not appear that it was collecting all text messages even when it was generally functioning to collect text messages.""FBI tech specialists cited a number of possible explanations for the text-collection breakdown, from a 2016 software bug, to misconfiguration during the phone’s setup to a range of possible hardware errors, according to the inspector general report.The collection tool had an estimated failure rate of 20 percent when used with FBI-issued Samsung S5 mobile devices. Both Strzok and Page used the S5 model during the five-month gap, the report found.Only later in mid-2017 were they issued S7 models ""as part of a regular technical refresh and to address issues with the FBl’s text message collection tool,"" according to the inspector general.An outside expert hired by the inspector general to assist with the Samsung portion of the investigation concluded ""it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,"" and the watchdog found no evidence they did.The inspector general also found the ""content of the text messages did not appear to be a factor"" in the retention practices of Strzok and Page.Separately from their Samsung devices, the two officials were issued Apple iPhones when they began working as members of the special counsel investigation.By the time the inspector general obtained their Apple phones, they had been reset to factory settings so they could be reassigned, and contained no data related to the previous owner’s use, the report states.The special counsel records officer told the inspector general that she reviewed Strzok's DOJ-issued iPhone after he returned it to the special counsel ""and determined it contained no substantive text messages."" (Upon her departure from the FBI, Page left her iPhone in her office, rather than return it to the special counsel records officer.)Trump’s tweet seems to suggest the Strzok-Page texts are gone forever — hence why Trump laments that they ""would have"" exonerated him.But this overlooks the fact that the inspector general managed to recover thousands of messages that were initially not collected because of the technical snafu described above.""OIG digital forensic examiners used forensic tools to recover thousands of text messages"" from the Samsung S5 devices of Strzok and Page, the report notes.Forensic experts recovered more than 9,300 texts sent or received from Strzok's S5 phone, about 8,300 of which were sent to or received from Page. They also collected 10,760 texts from Page’s S5 device, about 9,700 of which were communications with Strzok.It’s impossible to say with precision how many unique texts were recovered. That’s because some are duplicates, and because the inspector general nabbed some message fragments that did not have an associated date or time, and these were not included in the inspector general’s calculation. They also recovered texts from a separate database which added marginally to the overall number of texts the inspector general recovered.Trump’s reference to 19,000 texts appears to be the result of adding the total texts recovered from Strzok’s and Page’s S5 phones together.But his suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered a total of more than 126,000 lines of text from Strzok and Page.Trump said 19,000 text messages exchanged between former FBI officials that were ""purposely and illegally deleted ... would have explained (the special counsel investigation) hoax.""The Justice Department inspector general’s report suggests the texts slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI’s data-collection tool, not because Strzok and Page deliberately deleted them.An outside expert hired by the inspector general concluded ""it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,"" and the watchdog found no evidence they did.Trump’s suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered more than 19,000 messages from the government-issued Samsung phones of Strzok and Page, totaling more than 126,000 lines of text.And lastly, there is no evidence the texts show that the special counsel investigation is, as Trump called it, a ""hoax.""We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Christmas controversy: The Obamas never removed the White House nativity scene,"It’s the most wonderful time of the year — to spread misinformation.The holiday season brings out a lot of good, but it is also a prime time to resurface old rumors, embellishments and hoaxes.One example is a claim about the Obama administration’s war on a White House nativity scene.The posts are not true: The holy family display has been showcased in the East Room — without interruption — since it was donated to the White House in the 1960s.Here’s how we know. In 1978, Engelhard donated 10 additional figures and funds for a new tableau, which was first displayed in 1999.The rumor is said to have started back in 2009, during Obama’s first year in office.In the end, tradition won out, and the crèche was placed in its usual spot.""Donated to the White House in the 1960s, this piece has sat in the East Room for the holidays for more than 45 years, spanning nine administrations,"" the announcement says.Social media posts say the Obamas banned the display of the White House’s famous nativity scene throughout the years and credit First Lady Melania Trump for bringing it back.This is a long-standing hoax that tends to resurface during the holidays. There was no break for the White House nativity.The Obamas continued the tradition of showcasing the nativity scene in the East Room, according to previous news releases, archives, fact-checks and photo evidence. A Trump administration release also notes that the scene has been on display for over 50 years, since it was donated in 1967.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the photo of the migrant mother running from tear gas with her children was not staged","One widely published photo of the chaos that broke out between the Border Patrol and members of the migrant caravan is the subject of online conspiracy theories.The image, by Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon, captures Honduran migrant Miara Meza clinging to her small children as they run away from a tear gas canister.Here’s how we know the image is real.After being blocked at a port of entry at the border, hundreds from the group began a peaceful demonstration Nov. 25 that turned chaotic.Customs and Border Protection agents said that some protesters broke away from the group and tried to cross through an opening and began throwing rocks and bottles, at border agents. In response, agents unleashed tear gas on the crowd.Today, several migrants threw projectiles at the agents in San Diego. Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to dispel the group because of the risk to agents' safety. Several agents were hit by the projectiles. The situation is evolving and a statement is forthcoming.The photo of Meza and her children quickly spread and was used by news organizations around the world.""I felt sad, I was scared. I wanted to cry. That’s when I grabbed my daughters and ran,"" Meza told BuzzFeed. ""I thought my kids were going to die with me because of the gas we inhaled.""So, we know the photo wasn’t staged — and that Meza is a real person.Bloggers who promoted the conspiracy theory that it was faked by Democrats put up this marked-up version to make their case.""Upon further analysis, that ‘horrific’ picture of the woman with barefoot children in diapers running from the U.S. border wall was Fake News,"" the article declares.The article pointed out other photographers that could be seen in the background of the shot:""You can see a group of men posing for one cameraman while another young man is running toward a second cameraman. In other spots of the photo, people are just standing around calmly with no sense of urgency whatsoever. The woman with the children was just a photo-op.""First, it is obviously common for multiple photojournalists to cover the same breaking news event.More to the point, the tear gas happened. But don’t just take the photographic evidence and words of journalistic accounts for it; the Border Patrol acknowledged its own response.Bloggers posted an article that claims a photo of a migrant mother and her children fleeing from tear gas at the U.S.-Mexico border was a staged hoax. It isn’t. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the use of tear gas, which was documented by several news organizations.  And the Honduran woman featured running in a photo with her kids, Miara Meza, was tracked down and interviewed about what happened.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No evidence ‘many’ illegal immigrants voted in midterm elections, as Lou Dobbs said","With the election in the rearview mirror, the migrant caravan has mostly faded from the headlines. But a new concern over illegal immigrants and the midterms got play on Lou Dobbs’ Tonight, with the host claiming many non-citizen voters cast ballots in the race.Dobbs said illegal immigrants were having an ""immense impact."" He then went on to cite the potential consequences on the apportionment of congressional districts.We found no basis for the Fox Business Network host’s claim about undocumented people voting in the midterms.In the case of the 2018 midterms, we’ve found no evidence to back up Dobbs’ claim that many illegal immigrants voted.Fox News’ media contacts did not respond to our request for comment.""There’s zero evidence of even dozens, let alone millions, of non citizens voting in this or any other election,"" said according to David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-profit focused on election integrity.Dobbs’ claim that ""we are watching millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders"" needs context.Experts said the Department of Justice under President George W. Bush, and Republican and Democratic election officials have investigated voter fraud extensively and found it is extremely rare. President Trump’s short-lived voter fraud commission couldn’t find any evidence of widespread fraud before being disbanded.As for Dobbs’ claim, we rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Do you need an ID to buy a box of cereal, as Donald Trump said? Of course not"," Here’s what Trump told the conservative news outlet:""The Republicans don’t win, and that’s because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I’ve been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about it. And I’ve seen it, I’ve had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on.""The disgrace is that -- voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, you have a voter ID. Well, over here, the only thing you don’t is if you’re a voter of the United States. A voter in the United States of America. I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. Really a disgrace.""If this claim sounded ridiculous to you, it is. You don’t need an ID to buy a box of cereal, and in many states you do need an ID to vote. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)There’s an easy tip for anyone who doesn’t want to show an ID -- either a ""voter ID,"" as Trump put it, or just plain old driver’s license -- to purchase their Froot Loops. Use cash. Virtually any retailer will take it off your hands, no questions asked.In many if not most cases, credit cards are verified electronically at the point of sale, with no need for a separate ID check.Neither the National Retail Federation nor the National Grocers Association -- a trade group for independent and privately held retail and wholesale grocers -- said they tracked the percentage of retail outlets who demand a photo ID on top of electronic confirmation for credit and debit purchases. However, there are only ""a couple of instances where identification is required, for example, the purchase of age restricted products,"" such as alcohol or cigarettes, Laura S. Strange, vice president of industry relations, communications and marketing with the National Grocers Association.In other words, you can feel pretty safe holstering that ID card if you’re just buying cereal.In the interview, Trump made it sound as if the election system is a wild west where anybody can vote as many times as they want without showing an ID. He’s wrong.An additional 24 states have a ""non-strict"" voter ID law, meaning that at least some voters without acceptable identification have an option to cast a ballot that will be counted without further action on their part. Ten of these states specifically require a photo ID.That leaves only 16 states that do not require documentation at the polling place -- California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia.Trump said, ""If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID. … The only thing you don’t is if you’re a voter of the United States.""Anyone can buy a box of cereal with cash, ID-free, and in most cases they could pay for it with a credit or debit card without having to flash an ID, either. Meanwhile, many voters across the country do have to show an ID at the polls, contrary to Trump’s suggestion.The statement is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Facebook meme falsely attributes quote about race, slaves and Islam to Ilhan Omar","A Facebook meme falsely attributes a quote about race, slaves and Islam to Minnesota Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American Muslim woman.The first quote about being the ""president's nightmare"" is real. There’s no evidence for the explosive second part about white men in chains.Omar appeared on the The Daily Show with Trevor Noah in July 2017, then as a Minnesota state House representative. Omar filed to run for the U.S. Congress in June 2018 after Democratic U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison decided to run for the state’s attorney general office instead of seeking re-election. On Nov. 6, Omar was elected to Congress.In her Daily Show appearance, Noah told Omar she had a unique story, coming to the United States a refugee, being a Muslim, and a woman. ""You are everything that President Trump seems to be against. And you are in government. What’s the plan?""

PANTS-FIRE,No evidence Democrats and their allies ‘manufacturing voters’ in Florida recount,"A recount is underway in Florida, where three statewide races remain undecided a week after Election Day.Despite no final vote tally in the gubernatorial U.S. Senate and agriculture commissioner contests, some conservative pundits have accused their political opponents of fraud.""The forces on the left, the Democrats and their allies, are trying to push this to what I call within the margin of litigation,"" Ken Blackwell, a former Republican Ohio secretary of state, said during an appearance on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight. ""They are manufacturing voters. And they're doing it with an architect, Superintendent (Brenda) Snipes, who has a record of gross incompetence and fraud.""Here, we found no evidence to support the claim Democrats and their allies and manufacturing voters.Florida law stipulates that races separated by razor-thin margins trigger mandatory recounts.Blackwell accused Democrats and their allies of fraud during an appearance on Fox News on Nov. 9, three days after polls closed, but while votes were still being counted.It’s unclear exactly what Blackwell meant with the term ""manufacturing voters,"" and he did not respond to our request for comment.According to David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-profit focused on election integrity, the claim is baseless.""There’s zero evidence to support these allegations,"" Becker said. ""It’s unfortunate that some extreme partisans will work so hard to delegitimize our elections process just to win an election.""Eugene Pettis, an attorney representing Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes in election-related litigation, dismissed Blackwell’s comment as ""political noise.""""Unfortunately it’s not advancing the integrity of our electoral system,"" Pettis said. ""If you have  evidence of fraud put it on the table and notify authorities. If not stop the reckless rhetoric.""""Our staff has seen no evidence of criminal activity at this time,"" Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told PolitiFact.Blackwell said, ""Democrats and their allies (...) are manufacturing voters.""We found no evidence, nor has the state, to support this claim. Blackwell provided no evidence to support his statement.We rate this Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Online claim of double voting in Maryland lacks evidence,"Readers who look below the headline will see no story and no documentation, just a nearly-10-minute video of Jones' show in which an anonymous caller, identified as ""Kevin in West Virginia"" who says:""I actually moved to Maryland and I had to vote in Maryland for the early election or for early voting, and one thing that I witnessed -- people had already voted and they're letting them vote again. And this was in Hagerstown, Maryland. And I don't quite understand how they can do that.""Jones asks: ""What were you seeing?""Kevin responds: ""Well, I'm blind so I didn't see it. I could hear them saying, ‘Um, you know, Oh! You voted yesterday but you can go ahead and recast your vote again today.' I mean, it's insane, and I wish I could have pulled my phone out or recorder at the time and gotten this on audio or something.""Jones then asserts, without offering evidence, that Democrats in Maryland, Texas and ""all over"" have been busted for doing the same type of thing, adding, ""And it's always Democrats because they have no morals.""Jones does not ask, and the caller does not say, if there was any indication that the person trying to vote again was a Democrat.""Somebody's making a joke, I'm guessing,"" Donna Duncan, assistant deputy for election policy at the Maryland State Board of Elections, told PolitiFact in a phone interview.She said that early voting is done through the electronic voter registration database and anyone who tried to vote twice would be immediately flagged. Their only other option, if they insisted that they hadn't voted yet, would be to cast a provisional ballot, which would be investigated by election officials and never counted if it was confirmed that the person had already voted.Duncan said she was unaware of any specific complaints of double voting in the Nov 6 election.In short, InfoWars is alleging voting fraud by Democrats in Maryland based on the claim of a single anonymous caller who says he overheard a comment that was casually made in public under circumstances that, even if accurately interpreted, don't implicate any particular political party.Because the claim is absent of real evidence, we rate it Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,False Facebook post claims millions of fraudulent votes cast in California,"A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims that more than a million votes tallied in California were cast by unregistered voters, before the polls were even closed on Election Day.The post attributed the data to findings by the conservative group Judicial Watch. We reached out to Judicial Watch, which denied any affiliation with the post.""Not ours,"" said Jill Farrell, a Judicial Watch spokesperson. ""Just some random person misinterpreting.""Farrell suggested the post may have been a botched interpretation of a lawsuit Judicial Watch brought against the state of California and Los Angeles County.The litigation centers on California’s handling of state voter rolls, which contain a large number of voters who are considered ""inactive."" Registered voters may be rendered inactive if official election materials like a mail ballot or voter guide are sent and returned as undeliverable.The merits of the legal arguments are beyond the scope of this fact-check. What’s key here is that the Facebook post misses the critical distinction between inactive voters and fraudulent votes.Judicial Watch argues that retaining inactive voters on the rolls poses a voting fraud risk. The group does not claim more than a million fraudulent votes were cast in California, as this Facebook post states.

PANTS-FIRE,Viral image supposedly depicting caravan members as rock-throwers dates back years,"Though the so-called ""migrant caravan"" isn’t expected to reach the U.S.-Mexico border until late November, efforts are well underway to sow fears that the people seeking refuge in the United States are violent, disrespectful and entitled.  A recent submission to this anthology suggests that the migrants fleeing Central America are coming to get you.""All we want is a better life in your country,"" starts one Facebook post that appeared on Nov. 2. ""So we’re going to throw rocks and try to kill you.""The text frames an image of about a couple dozen men in what looks like a dusty melee. Some of the men have their arms in the air, and several seem to be throwing something. ""Dixon Diaz 2018"" appears to be written in the bottom left corner.On Nov. 1, President Donald Trump said he had told the military that troops should react to any rocks migrants throw at them as if they were rifles.

PANTS-FIRE,Voting will not cost you your hunting license in North Dakota,"The North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party is running a Facebook ad in North Dakota that claims your hunting license is at risk. It’s not.""Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses,"" says the Facebook ad, which began running on Nov. 1.We ran the ad by Cameron Wimpy, research director at MIT Election Data and Science Lab.""I do absolutely think it is voter suppression to try and trick folks this way,"" Wimpy said.Most North Dakota hunters can breathe easy.If you have an out-of-state hunting license anywhere outside of North Dakota -- and it’s an out-of-state license, rather than a residential one for residents of that state -- you’re safe.If you have a North Dakota residential hunting license, you’re also safe, because in applying for that license you already gave up any other residential licenses. North Dakota’s Game and Fish department doesn’t allow a person to hold two residential licenses. (Those tend to expire within a season or year anyway.)In theory, this applies to folks living in North Dakota who have a residential license in a state other than North Dakota, which conceivably could be people who have just moved. (This is the basis on which the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party, which is the state’s branch of the Democratic Party, defended the ad.) Would casting a vote in North Dakota make even those licenses void? We found no evidence of that.We called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota’s neighboring states: Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota. They all told us that voting in North Dakota wouldn’t make them lose their licenses.""If they purchased that license prior to leaving Montana as legal resident, it is valid until the expiration date, no matter what they do in North Dakota,"" said Ron Jendro, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department.The same goes for Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota; the licenses are valid until they expire.For other states, establishing residency elsewhere means their resident hunting license is void. That’s the case in North Dakota and Kentucky, the two other states whose hunting permit offices we called.But there’s no way that casting a vote would suddenly make those licenses null. Lee Ann Oliver, elections specialist at the North Dakota Secretary of State’s office, told us they have a central voter file, but fish and wildlife departments don’t get access to that database.And anyway, in order to vote, a person has to already have established residency.""They’re putting the cart before the horse,"" Oliver said. ""You have to be a resident before you can vote.""Voters can show a North Dakota driver’s license, nondriver’s identification card, tribal ID or long term care card. If those don’t include a current North Dakota residential address or date of birth, the voter may supplement their ID with a variety of documents, like bills or bank statements.North Dakota Democratic-NPL said, ""Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses.""It’s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting. But voting will not cost anyone their hunting licenses. People with out-of-state hunting licenses get to keep their licenses; the warning only applies to people with residential licenses in another state who recently moved to North Dakota. Voting would not make those null, but establishing residency in another state, which is a prerequisite to voting, might, depending on the state.The ad employs a ridiculous argument. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, Jared Golden does not want to use Social Security funds to pay for other programs","Just days before voters head to the polls, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a new ad blasting Jared Golden, the Democratic candidate running for the U.S. House seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District.Here's the NRCC ad in full:""They call them the golden years, when you’re supposed to enjoy the life you worked so hard to build. But politician Jared Golden wants to turn your golden years into his. Golden supports a reckless bill to end Medicare as we know it. And he supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs. Jared Golden would steal your golden years to pay for his reckless agenda. Maine seniors can’t afford that risk.""Here, we are going to focus on the accusation that Golden ""supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs.""The claim is based on Golden’s one-time support of a statewide referendum, often referred to as ""Homecare for All,"" that will appear on the ballot in Maine on Nov. 6.The initiative would raise taxes on wealthier Mainers to help pay for a universal home care program. While there is debate over who the tax will affect, it has no direct ties to Social Security, would not cause people to lose their benefits and Golden does not support it in its current form.The citizen-initiated referendum would fund a home care program for elderly and disabled Mainers by implementing a tax on higher incomes in the state. It would also create a government board to administer the funds.It wouldn’t.The closest connection is the threshold in which the Maine home care tax would kick in, on incomes more than $128,400. That’s because the government funds Social Security by taxing incomes up to $128,400.""If you’re like more than 98 percent of people in this state, you already pay a tax on all of the income you earn in order to fund Social Security, and your employer does the same,"" Golden wrote in the op-ed. ""Individuals who are paid more than $128,400 a year, however, currently do not pay any Social Security tax on income greater than that amount. The referendum would ask them to pay a bit more of their fair share on all of their income, like the rest of us already do.""But Golden’s campaign said he wrote that before language changed in the final wording of the bill. Golden actually no longer supports the bill, because it could apply to families earning more than $128,400 a year as opposed to individuals.Golden’s campaign manager Jon Breed told us that while Golden believes there is a growing problem in Maine's home health care system, he ""does not agree that families with incomes over $128,000 should face a 3.8 percent tax increase.""At one point in the analysis, it says that ""Mainers will be asked whether to partially close the Social Security tax loophole to fund a universal home care program.""The report says the initiative would be the first of its kind in the country, and creates a new tax structure for high income earners that picks up where Social Security taxes leaves off. The tax also applies to non-wage income, which is currently untaxed by payroll-type taxes.What does that all mean for Social Security?Not much, as the threshold is the referendum’s only link to Social Security. The home care program would be funded through a new tax on high earners, not Social Security.The National Republican Campaign Committee said Golden ""supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs.""The group is referring to Golden’s previous support of a state referendum that will appear on the ballot in Maine and would implement a tax on wealthier Mainers to fund a home care program. (Golden’s campaign says he no longer supports it after a recent change.)The program would not result in cuts to Social Security. The NRCC distorted a thin link, as the Maine tax would be levied above the current Social Security cut-off of $128,400.Again, it would not result in a decrease of senior’s Social Security benefits.We rate it Pants on Fire."

That was nearly double the $2.3 million raised by Brat - or a $2.2 million difference.Brat says Soros organizations are responsible for the difference.""...Abigail Spanberger is getting $2.2 million from the Soros-linked resist movement - ActBlue,"" Brat said during an Oct. 22 interview on the John Frederick Show in Portsmouth.We wondered whether Brat is right in claiming Spanberger’s campaign has received $2.2 million from a Soros-controlled group called ActBlue. Let’s take a look.What is ActBlue?Fleming declined give the sum of Soros' donations to candidates through ActBlue. But he emphasized that Soros does not financially support ActBlue nor play a role in its operations. ""ActBlue is in no way related to George Soros,"" he said.Soros has not personally given money to Spanberger’s campaign or to any Democrat running for Congress during this two-year election cycle, according to FEC records.Brat’s explanationWe asked Brat’s campaign for proof of the candidate’s claim that ActBlue ""is the George Soros resistance group."" Katey Price, Brat’s campaign spokesperson, sent an article from USA Today and blogs from two conservative websites: Human Events and The Daily Signal.Our rulingBrat says of Spanberger, ""She got $2.2 million for ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group."" Brat is implausibly positioning Soros, the focus of many conservative theorists, as the power behind Spanberger’s campaign.ActBlue is not a Soros-controlled organization. It’s a nonprofit group that provides a software platform that allows people to contribute to Democratic candidates and causes through their personal computers and cell phones. ActBlue is a conduit; it does not raise political money.As of Sept. 25, Spanberger had raised almost $2.2 million through ActBlue. The money came for from several thousand individuals, not Soros. Brat’s attempts to tie Soros to ActBlue and, therefore, Spanberger’s campaign - sometimes through third or fourth-hand links - is contrived and deceptive.We rate Brat’s statement Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Democrats let a cop-killing immigrant into the country,"In his final push before the midterms, President Donald Trump promoted a political video that says Democrats are responsible for letting a murderer stay in the country illegally to kill people.The video opens with courtroom footage of a smiling Luis Bracamontes. Superimposed are the words, ""Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!""As Bracamontes boasts about killing the two officers and saying he would kill more if he could, new text says, ""Democrats let him into our country.""That’s quickly followed with, ""Democrats let him stay.""The video continues with footage from the caravan of Central Americans moving north in Mexico. At the end, it returns to Bracamontes’ smirking face and asks, ""Who else would Democrats let in?""The final text says, ""President Donald Trump and Republicans are making America safe again.""Was Bracamontes in America because Democrats let him in? Not for his most recent entry. And did lax policies under Democrats let him stay? He evaded discovery, despite increasing efforts to track down criminal and immigration law offenders.Davis, of the Placer County Sheriff’s Office, responded in October 2014 to a call of a suspicious vehicle occupied by a man and a woman. Davis was shot as he got out of his car and later died in the hospital.Authorities said that before shooting Davis, Bracamontes also shot and killed Oliver, of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, when he was investigating a suspicious vehicle in a motel parking lot that same day. Authorities said Bracamontes shot Oliver in the forehead and then fled.Bracamontes comes from Mexico, and his adult life followed a pattern of sneaking across the border, being deported, and sneaking back in.He was arrested for drug possession in Arizona in 1996. That was in Maricopa County, the home of then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Federal authorities deported him in 1997.Sometime after 2001, Bracamontes moved to Utah and began using an alias.Bracamontes’ time in America up to the killings spanned three administrations.He was arrested and deported once under Democratic President Bill Clinton, but there was a failure to deport him in 1998.He was arrested and deported again in 2001, this time under Republican President George W. Bush. He came back that same year, and was arrested again in 2001.After that, Bracamontes apparently evaded deportation through the time of his 2014 killing spree during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama.So for eight years, from 2001 through 2008, you could argue a Republican administration failed to identify and definitively deport him. For five years, from 2009 to 2014, a Democratic administration similarly failed. (And if you want to give blame to Congress for not passing stricter laws or dedicating more resources, the two different parties shared control of Congress during the timeframe in question.)Immigration enforcement tools strengthened after 9/11 with the subsequent creation of the Department of Homeland Security, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.Overall, research shows that the crime rate among immigrants, including those here illegally, is lower than in the general population, Capps said.""The implication of this video is that there’s a large number of criminals in the unauthorized population, which isn’t true,"" Capps said. ""That’s the fundamental point of this commercial, and it’s wrong.""Trump’s tweet included footage of migrants walking north to the United States, of some attempting to push through a fence at the Guatemala-Mexico border, and of a Fox News interview of a man in the caravan saying he wanted to ask for pardon. A woman translating in the video says the pardon he’s seeking is for attempted murder.Trump tweeted a video that said ""Democrats let him (cop killer Luis Bracamontes) into our country,"" and ""Democrats let him stay.""The reality is that Bracamontes’ last illegal entry was under Bush, a Republican president. The majority of his time going undetected was also on the Republican watch, though some of it was on the Democrats’ watch, too.Democratic and Republican administrations deported Bracamontes, but also failed to keep Bracamontes out of the United States. We found no evidence that he was proactively allowed to stay. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,2015 letter doesn't reveal Soros 'plot' to use migration to take down borders,"The article’s headline claims, ""Soros Letter Reveals Plot to ‘Take Down Borders’ with Migrant Caravan Invasions,"" in reference to the nearly 7,000 people making their way to the United States-Mexican border that originated in Honduras two weeks ago.The article claims that, ""As the Left continues to lose the battle for America’s soul, its greatest champions are going all-out in an attempt to turn the tide any way they can – even if it means destroying the country.""In October 2015, Orban accused Soros of being part of a group of ""activists"" that ""weakens nation states.""In response, Soros emailed a statement to Bloomberg Business, defending his position.Orban’s plan, Soros wrote at the time, ""treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.""In his statement, Soros doesn’t say his goal is ""wiping out all national borders,"" like NewsPunch claims.Soros, who was born in Hungary to a Jewish family and lived through the Nazi invasion, does give financial support to organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrants seeking asylum.""Ideologies that claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth are making a false claim; therefore, they can be imposed on society only by compulsion. All such ideologies lead to repression. Popper proposed a more attractive form of social organization: an open society in which people are free to hold divergent opinions and the rule of law allows people with different views and interests to live together in peace. Having lived through both German and Russian occupation here in Hungary, I found the idea of an open society immensely attractive.""That is not the same thing as supporting the destruction of national borders.Open Society Foundations, an international grantmaking network founded by Soros in 1979, denied Gaetz’s claim that Soros or his philanthropies are funding the migration.NewsPunch claimed that Soros’ 2015 statement to Bloomberg Business in response to Orban’s accusations, ""Reveals Plot to ‘Take Down Borders’ with Migrant Caravan Invasions.""

PANTS-FIRE,"Did CAIR, Muslim Brotherhood back a Democratic candidate?","The U.S. House race in California’s 50th district has gotten nasty.The ad then plays video aired by the conservative One America News Network: ""A Palestinian-Mexican American doesn’t get his support from the people of San Diego.’ ‘He is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.’ ‘This is a well-orchestrated plan.’"" The ad closes, ""Ammar Campa-Najjar: A risk we can’t ignore."" The assertion about the support for Campa-Najjar’s campaign is not accurate.Despite Hunter’s continued invocation of radical Islam in the campaign, Campa-Najjar is actually a Christian of long standing.In a statement provided by Campa-Najjar’s campaign, Mike Meeks, pastor emeritus of EastLake Church, said, ""I have known Ammar since he was 16, when he became part of our youth ministry. Before he left for college, he grew up serving our janitorial staff, worship team, and youth ministry, where he even gave Sunday Youth group sermons. When he served in federal government, we talked regularly about life and the faith challenges of following Jesus in today’s world. Through it all, Ammar remains committed to growing in his faith, following Jesus and serving his community.""Furthermore, neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor CAIR are legally able to support a candidate.Over the years, the United States’ relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood has ranged from uneasy tolerance to outright opposition.Laws aside, there is no evidence that either group has given money to Campa-Najjar. The most one could say is that a few CAIR volunteers have done so in their personal capacity.""None of the seven donors held paid positions with CAIR, according to public tax reports,"" the newspaper reported. ""Donors listed their primary employers and occupations — their day jobs — to identify themselves to the campaign as required by the FEC.""For instance, the Union-Tribune reached David Chami, an attorney who lives in Arizona and serves on the board of a local CAIR chapter. Chami told the newspaper ""that he is not paid by CAIR and that his contribution was independent and based solely on Campa-Najjar’s position on consumer advocacy laws.""He added, ""My decision to help a particular candidate is based on their political positions and issues they support. It has nothing to do with religion and if it did, I’m Muslim and he is a Christian.""Robert S. McCaw, the director of government affairs for CAIR, told PolitiFact, ""We can confirm that CAIR or its chapters did not donate to or endorse Campa-Najjar. What staff or board members do on their own time is their own business.""’Hunter’s office did not respond to an inquiry.Hunter said, ""Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress"" and ""is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.""Neither group can do so under federal law, and there is no evidence that they have broken the law to donate to his campaign. Campa-Najjar has received more than a dozen personal donations from people who happen to be CAIR volunteers. We could find no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood.This is an unsubstantiated accusation that rests on fear-mongering. We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump touts nonexistent $450 billion in Saudi orders and 1 million jobs ,"The death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Istanbul has drawn attention to America’s business interests in the Middle East kingdom.President Donald Trump brought money into the picture soon after Khashoggi disappeared, and has repeated the point several times since.""With all that being said though, we have $450 billion, $110 billion of which is a military order, but this is equipment and various things ordered from Saudi Arabia, $450 billion,"" Trump said. ""I think it's over a million jobs. That's not helpful for us to cancel an order like that. That hurts us far more than it hurts them.""The $110 billion in arms sales to the Saudis would be eye-popping enough, but this was the first time we heard the $450 billion total that included everything else. Nor has Trump said that 1 million jobs are on the line.We decided to check those points.Saudi Arabia has not ordered $110 billion worth of military goods and services.Saudi Arabia has not ordered $450 billion worth of goods and services across the board.Over one million jobs are not at stake.The $110 billion in military contracts emerged from Trump’s 2017 meeting with King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. (Mohamed bin Salman is now crown prince and sits at the center of the speculation over the circumstances of Khashoggi’s death.)The press release said the arms package expanded opportunities for American companies in the region, ""potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.""Note: Tens of thousands is a far cry from hundreds of thousands of jobs, but we’ll get back to that in a moment.The $110 billion itself is in doubt.And even that sum is suspect, Caverley added.The U.S. approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution in Washington said that deal is on shaky ground.Defense analyst Rachel Stohl at the Stimson Center, a private defense policy think tank, noted that the $110 billion rolled in some old offers.""Many of those were deals negotiated under the Obama administration, and only a small fraction have been filled,"" Stohl said.That’s the typical pattern for these announcements: Fanfare comes first, followed by a more modest reality.""President Obama offered Saudi Arabia something like $115 billion in arms while in office, and just about half of that resulted in sales,"" Jennifer Spindel, an international security professor at the University of Oklahoma, told us.That time lag has major implications for jobs.Before we get into the dicey link between contracts and jobs in America, it’s important to note that some of the deals involve building things in Saudi Arabia, not the United States.Divide the jobs by the dollars and you find that for every dollar in exports, the United States gets .0000056 of a job. Which might not like sound like much, but obviously it does when you start talking about billions in sales.Now, if the $110 billion in arms sales were locked down and came in one single year, the math says they would generate more than 600,000 jobs.Here’s why that isn’t in the cards.We know the $110 billion is at best aspirational, but the other big issue is that military contracts play out over many years. The arms experts we reached said smaller ones of about $200 to $300 million typically take three to four years for completion. The bigger systems take much longer.""A decade is the ballpark in terms of minimum time between initial signing of a deal and the delivery of the capability, with money disbursed across the life of the contract,"" Caverley at the War College said. ""It will probably take even longer given the new Saudi requirements that 50 percent of the work needs to be performed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will have to develop a massive amount of defense industrial capability that currently does not exist in order to handle this work.""Even if Saudi Arabia bought everything it said it wanted, the yearly jobs impact would be more in the range of 60,000 to 120,000. That’s not close to the hundreds of thousands Trump has talked about.Trump said that all told, Saudi Arabia has $450 billion in orders from the United States. We asked the White House and the U.S. - Saudi Arabian Business Council for any data on this.We did not hear back.Hossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump’s assertion.""There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion,"" Askari said.Trump said that Saudi Arabia has ordered $450 billion from U.S. companies, including $110 billion in military contracts, representing over a million jobs.Orders on that scale don’t exist. There is no data behind the $450 billion, and the $110 billion is a blend of smaller deals in progress, old offers that have not come through, and speculative discussions that have yet to move forward.Trump’s claims about jobs ignores the long runway between signed agreements and actual delivery and payment. He treats spending that could play out over a decade as if it were spent in one year. More importantly, if the $450 billion in orders is a mirage, the 1 million jobs is equally without substance.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Andrew Gillum's Pants on Fire claim on Florida's low unemployment rate,"Gov. Rick Scott has touted a strong Florida economy built up over his two terms in office. But Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate seeking to replace him, says the economy is ""propped up"" by low wages and people working multiple jobs just to make ends meet.""I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work,"" Gillum said. ""Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet.""Gillum doesn’t see that as positively as Scott. But his point that low unemployment indicates that people are working multiple low-wage jobs to make ends meet doesn’t hold up.Official unemployment rates are not affected by the number of jobs people hold.Florida’s percentage of residents with more than one job does not deviate from national trends.The number of jobs in Florida has risen 2.8 percentage points faster than the number of workers in Florida over the past eight years, based on data from the federal Household and Payroll surveys.Moody's Analytics senior economist Kwame Donaldson said that’s evidence some workers have more than one job. However, he said, Florida is ranked 26th in the United States in this measure. Nationally, the number of jobs rose 2.9 percentage points faster than the number of workers in that time period.Data about multiple job holders isn’t specific enough to draw conclusions about the quality of the jobs, according to Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness.""You can have multiple jobs even if your primary job is high-paying,"" Snaith said.Over the past year, the number of American workers who’ve held multiple jobs has ranged between 6 million and 7 million, compared to more than 148 million who are employed in a single job.The number of jobs people hold does not affect the BLS unemployment rate. People are counted as employed as long as they hold one job. They do not get counted again if they hold more than one.""The claim about multiple jobs and unemployment is simply not true,"" Snaith said.Gillum said that unemployment was low because people were working multiple jobs.Unemployment rates are not influenced by how many jobs someone holds, and not many people hold more than one job.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about Democrats, pre-existing conditions","Democrats across the country have been saying on the campaign trail that the Republicans’ longstanding push to overturn the Affordable Care Act threatens insurance protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.The law was passed in 2010 by a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by President Barack Obama; no Republican voted for it. Republicans used popular dissatisfaction with the law to make significant congressional gains in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, but the pattern has shifted in 2018, after unsuccessful Republican efforts to repeal the law.But in a rally in Rochester, Minn., on Oct. 4, President Donald Trump sought to flip this narrative on its head. He argued that it’s actually the Republicans who are the champions of pre-existing condition protections, and Democrats who are trying to kill them.The second part of Trump’s assertion, however, was new to us. Is he right that ""some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions""?We found zero evidence of this.Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is no such chatter among Democratic officeholders or candidates.We also asked independent health-policy experts whether they had heard any Democratic messages — or even whispers — about getting rid of pre-existing condition protections. They said they had not.""I find President Trump’s comments surprising,"" said Christine Eibner, a health policy specialist at the Rand Corp.""I can’t think of any,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush.""No — how bad can this (rhetoric) get?"" asked John Holahan, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute.""Unbelievable,"" said Linda Blumberg, who also studies health policy at the Urban Institute. ""No.""The White House did not reply to an inquiry seeking examples. Neither did the office of the Senate majority leader or the House speaker.Trump said, ""Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending (coverage for) pre-existing conditions.""We can’t find any examples of what Trump claimed Democrats were saying. A Democratic proposal to end pre-existing conditions would run 100 percent counter to Democrats’ own history with the Affordable Care Act and would undercut one of the Democrats’ most powerful messages on the campaign trail this year.We rate the statement Pants on Fire.UPDATE: Shortly after publication, we lengthened the excerpt of Trump's remarks, so readers could read his complete thought."
PANTS-FIRE,"In Illinois race for Congress, Mike Bost makes a head-scratching claim","To hear U.S. Rep. Mike Bost tell it, his 2018 election challenger in Illinois has ""spent his career"" supporting Nancy Pelosi. Not only that, says Bost, a Republican, in a TV ad, but Democrat Brendan Kelly has spent that career also supporting Mike Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House.This seemed puzzling.Kelly started his post-Navy career as a county employee. Since 2010 he has been state’s attorney — the top prosecutor — for St. Clair County, Ill., a county bordering St. Louis, Mo. Prosecutors don’t get votes in the state Legislature. They don’t vote in Congress.So how has Kelly ""spent his career"" supporting the top Democratic legislative leaders? We asked the Bost campaign, and the answer is still puzzling.The ad has two parts, first telling voters what Bost wants them to know about his opponent, then saying what he wants them to know about himself. Bost was in the Illinois House for 20 years until winning his congressional seat in 2014. Seated at a table and wearing an open-collar, button-down shirt, he says:""Folks, they’re at it again. I’ve spent 20 years fighting Pelosi and Madigan; my opponent has spent his career supporting them.""He then says, ""I’ve never stopped fighting for our families. Whether it’s creating a stronger economy or bringing our steel jobs back or reforming the VA to ensure better care for our veterans, or fighting for fair trade and a level playing field, I’ve never wavered.""So how has Kelly, a prosecutor, spent his career supporting Pelosi and Madigan?Bost’s campaign sent PolitiFact several articles on Kelly’s fundraising. The articles pointed out that even though Kelly says he wants someone other than Pelosi to be the next U.S. House Democratic leader, he has benefitted from Pelosi’s fundraising. That was the very headline in a Real Clear Politics article in April: ""Non-Supporter of Pelosi Benefits From Her Fundraising.""An article in the St. Louis American in late April said that U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), came to East St. Louis to stump for Kelly. The DCCC tries to get Democrats elected to Congress, and Lujan was Pelosi’s pick for the chairmanship, making him part of her team.Pelosi, Lujan and a number of incumbent Illinois congressional Democrats, including Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, sponsored a Washington fundraiser on April 25 for four Illinois Democrats -- including Kelly -- hoping to join them in Congress if elected, according to another piece of backup material the Bost campaign sent us.Finally, there was an article on June 1 in the Illinois Review: ""Pelosi to raise funds for Democratic contenders.""Kelly told Real Clear Politics for its story that he doesn’t support Pelosi as his party’s leader but that the Washington fundraising invitation came from the Illinois Democratic congressional delegation, not Pelosi.We asked the Bost campaign again: How does Pelosi’s fundraising help show that Kelly, a county officeholder, ""spent his career supporting"" Pelosi and Madigan?""We might be arguing over semantics here,"" Bost campaign spokesman George O’Connor answered in an email. ""Brendan Kelly's liberal record and fundraising speaks for itself and shows that he's already in Pelosi's pocket.""Had Bost said as much in the ad, we might find ourselves examining that claim. But that is not what Bost said in an ad to voters in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District.Kelly’s campaign, of course, disagrees with Bost. Here is what Kelly campaign spokesman Sam Barrett said: ""Brendan has been the state's attorney in St. Clair County for the past eight years. Before that he was the county clerk and before that he was an assistant state's attorney. And before law school he served in the U.S. Navy.""He has never voted for Nancy Pelosi, has vowed in multiple interviews that he won't and hasn't taken a dime from her campaign account nor her leadership account.""You can make a case that since Kelly is a Democrat, he supports the general ideals of top Democrats, be they in Washington or Springfield. But to single out Pelosi in particular, and even Madigan, and say Kelly has spent his career supporting them is a stretch.He has never had a vote on legislation, Democrat- or Republican-sponsored. Much of his career has involved prosecution, and occurred about 800 miles from where Pelosi presides over her party. Pelosi has raised money for Kelly, not vice versa. Even if her fundraising assistance was a sign of reciprocal support from Kelly — which is a reach — it occurred in 2018, a single year in Kelly’s significantly longer career.Turn up the flames. It’s Pants on Fire."

Now they are debating another type of red scare: socialism.""They want big government and socialism,"" Scott said. ""They're both into higher taxes. Gillum said he's going to raise corporate taxes 40 percent. Nelson said that, if the Democrats get control, he's going to go back and raise the taxes. They don't believe that the tax cuts that we did this year are good for our state. If you look at their programs, they just want government to run everything.""Calling a politician in Florida a socialist packs particular punch because some Hispanic voters, a battleground demographic, have fled socialist regimes.Nelson has praised Gillum and may get a boost from the voter excitement he is generating. But he does not share Gillum’s more liberal positions.Scott’s campaign said in a press release that Nelson called Gillum's support for higher taxes, government-run health care and abolishing ICE ""mainstream.""Nelson said that Gillum’s policies weren’t too progressive for Florida, but he made no specific reference to raising taxes, government-run health care or abolishing ICE. Here is what Nelson actually said about Gillum’s platform:Nelson said he doesn’t want to abolish ICE. When asked about Medicare for All, Nelson didn’t show interest. ""I've got enough trouble just trying to save Obamacare,"" Nelson said. ""I'm into results.""The Scott campaign also said that Nelson ""embraced Obama’s plan to appease Cuban dictators and palled around with Assad and Hugo Chavez.""Socialism is when the government owns (or at least controls) the means of production. Nelson hasn’t called for a government takeover of businesses.""Claiming that Nelson is a socialist is ludicrous,"" said Philip J. Williams, professor at the Center for Latin American studies at the University of Florida. ""His stance in opposition to the tax cut bill and in support of Medicaid expansion are mainstream Democratic positions. (Even some Republican governors have supported Medicaid expansion, including John Kasich.)""While some might describe Medicare or Medicaid as socialism, because the government is providing health insurance to citizens, the health industry remains in private hands, said Sean D. Ehrlich, a Florida State University political science professor.""The government doesn’t control the production of health care,"" Ehrlich said, ""they merely regulate some elements and reimburse providers and consumers for their health care costs.""University of Miami professor Merike Blofield, an expert in Latin American and comparative politics, said that by the standards of other wealthy liberal democracies with public, universal health care, Nelson’s policy proposals are conservative.Scott’s description of Nelson as a ""socialist"" is an inaccurate red scare tactic.The definition of socialism is a government takeover of production, and Nelson hasn’t called for that.Scott’s campaign pointed to Nelson’s support for Gillum, the Democrat running to the left of Nelson in the governor’s race. While Nelson has shown enthusiasm for Gillum, they are not lockstep on all issues.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford isn't linked to abortion pill","Several headlines on the internet claim Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, had an ulterior motive.Others took it further.But claiming that Corcept sells an abortion pill is like saying a road salt company sells food seasoning.The company sells Korlym to treat Cushing's syndrome, a rare, deadly condition characterized by high cortisol levels. Korlym’s main ingredient, mifepristone, blocks the effect of cortisol.That ingredient has another use.Just like it blocks cortisol, mifepristone blocks progesterone, which is crucial to the development of a pregnancy. In a medication-induced abortion, mifepristone is administered first and another drug, misoprostol, follows. That empties the uterus by causing cramping and bleeding.The latter drug, misoprostol, can and is used alone for abortions. However, the combination of both drugs is typically used for greater effectiveness and fewer side effects.Mifepristone, on the other hand, is not administered alone to induce abortions. In some other countries, it is used alone as emergency contraception, according to Clare Flannery, a professor of endocrinology and reproductive sciences at Yale University. That’s not an abortifacient, according to Flannery, because it plays a role before the sperm and egg implant in the uterus. (Pregnancy occurs after implantation.)In order to induce an abortion in the United States, a low dose of mifepristone is used only once in combination with misoprostol. Korlym patients take up to four times that dose of mifepristone daily for months or even years.""Mifepristone was developed in 1980, but there was so much political concern for its use in aiding abortions, that its other therapeutic potentials were overlooked and companies were nervous to pursue it for other conditions,"" Flannery said.The company explicitly warns about the drug’s potential to terminate a pregnancy.""Korlym should never be taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant,"" a banner on the website reads. ""Taking Korlym during pregnancy will result in the loss of a pregnancy. A pregnancy test is required before starting Korlym or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days.""A headline said, ""Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker… effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits.""Ford worked for a pharmaceutical company that sells Korlym, a drug that treats Cushing’s syndrome. The main ingredient in that drug is used in combination with another drug to induce abortions, but the doses differ. The company does not promote the drug for abortions; in fact, it requires that doctors rule out pregnancy in order to administer the drug.We rate this statement Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"Ken Paxton draws on debunked figures, says 'illegals' committed 600,000 crimes in Texas since 2011","""And the reality is we already struggle with this,"" Paxton went on. ""We’ve had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides. We've had human trafficking. We've had all kinds of drug crimes. And if we make it more lenient, we’re going to get more of it. So, it’s going to cost lives if we go down this path,"" Paxton said.We can’t check a prediction about what happens if fewer people crossing the border get charged with crimes. But the big crime counts aired by Paxton reminded us we’ve long found flaws in citations of counts of crimes and homicides attributed to information publicized by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the lead state agency tasked with helping keep watch over the Texas-Mexico border.Let’s plumb our relevant past fact-checks before reviewing the meat of Paxton’s statement.Rick Perry's flammable 2014 claimIn July 2014, Gov. Rick Perry warned about the security of the Texas-Mexico border by  declaring that more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by ""illegal aliens"" in six years.We identified other complications that, it turned out, also weakened a pair of subsequent claims we checked that were based on DPS-posted numbers.Also, Michael Walker, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New  York, said the DPS information didn’t even demonstrate the homicides occurred any time recently or in any particular state. Meantime, Northeastern University criminologist Ramiro Martinez, Jr. built his own analysis of Texas crime numbers and told us that if Perry’s claim held up, it would mean that more than half the state’s homicides in the six years were committed by unauthorized residents--an absurdity. ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed,"" Martinez commented.Two 2018 immigrant-crime claimsWe found that Hannity’s claim, triggered by DPS-posted figures, reflected on mostly petty charges leveled through the lifetimes of 245,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into local Texas jails from June 2011 through February 2018--and 34 percent of them weren’t identified as living in the U.S. without legal authorization at their latest arrest, the DPS said.Generally, nonviolent offenses predominated, accounting for 66 percent of the tallied charges and 55 percent of career convictions. Martinez looked over these DPS-posted numbers, later saying that to his eyes, they reflected what’s known about most domestic crime--a ""sea of minor drug and property crimes.""Paxton points to DPS figuresVinger later told us by email that the revised web page ""only refers to charges and convictions for criminal aliens who were in the country illegally. Past versions,"" Vinger wrote, presented higher counts by showing ""charges and convictions for all criminal aliens – legal and illegal."" Another change: Vinger said the previous web page tallied crimes for each jailed individual’s criminal ""career"" while the new version, he wrote, shows charges and convictions occurring since June 2011.However, we didn’t spot information on the revised web page supporting Paxton’s reference to ""illegals"" committing over 600,000 crimes and more than 1,200 homicides since 2011. The newly available figures linked far fewer offenses, including homicides, to unauthorized residents.According to U.S. Department of Homeland Security ""status indicators,"" the DPS reported, ""over 261,000 criminal aliens were booked into Texas jails between June 1, 2011, and July 31, 2018, of which over 175,000 were classified as illegal aliens."" In the same period, DPS says, ""these 175,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 273,000 criminal offenses and  which included arrests for 505 homicide"" charges.All those criminal charges, the DPS says, ""have thus far resulted in over 114,000 convictions including 229 homicide convictions; 12,801 assault convictions; 3,016 burglary convictions; 17,002 drug convictions; 159 kidnapping convictions; 6,820 theft convictions; 10,846 obstructing police convictions; 962 robbery convictions; 1,596 sexual assault convictions; 1,087 sexual offense convictions; and 1,215 weapon convictions.""According to the web page, Homeland Security separately identified another 10,182 ""illegal aliens,"" all imprisoned in Texas, who together had been charged with more than 6,000 criminal offenses included 83 homicide charges.We combined the two sets of counts--a move supporting the conclusion that, per the DPS, more than 185,000 individuals believed to be living in the U.S. without legal permission were jailed in Texas over the seven-plus years who all told accounted for more than 279,000 criminal charges and over 114,000 convictions including 589 homicide charges and 229 homicide convictions--on all fronts, considerably shy of what Paxton said.Cato perspectivePut another way, Nowrasteh said by email, the ""most crime-prone group in Texas were American natives.""Our rulingPaxton said Texas has ""had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides.""Both of these numbers--which we’ve twice debunked in detail since 2010--exceed what the state estimates by more than 400 percent. DPS-posted figures lately suggest that since mid-2011, Texas-jailed individuals believed to be living in the U.S. without legal permission account for 229 homicide convictions among more than 114,000 convictions across a range of mostly minor offenses.We rate Paxton's claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Sen. McCain did not commit treason in Vietnam,"After Sen. John McCain passed away on Aug. 25, publications nationwide applauded his service, both in the Navy and in the Senate. But news of McCain’s death also dragged up old claims that McCain was not the war hero he claimed to be.A 2017 article posted on Revenge of the Herd claims, ""John McCain was pardoned for treason."" It alleges that, during his time as a prisoner of war, McCain gave information to the North Vietnamese in exchange for better treatment, and that he would have been executed if President Richard Nixon didn’t pardon him.The story resurfaced after McCain’s death and was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)It’s not true.While serving in the Navy in 1967, McCain’s plane was shot down over North Vietnam. His right leg and both of his arms were broken in the crash, and McCain was taken prisoner by  North Vietnamese soldiers. He was held captive for the next five and half years, often in solitary confinement. By McCain’s account, he was frequently denied medical attention and beaten in exchange for information.The Revenge of the Herd article focuses on two alleged acts of treason. The first surrounded an allegation that McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment.In his book, Faith of My Fathers, McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when he was shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese.It’s impossible to determine everything McCain told his captors -- interrogations took place one-on-one, in secluded prisons, more than 50 years ago. Based on his personal accounts, though, McCain was used mostly for propaganda: filmmakers would show him in the hospital, being treated by the North Vietnamese. Officials also encouraged him to say that he wanted the war to end, or that he was grateful to his captors and sorry for his participation in the fighting. McCain said he refused to do so.McCain admitted he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron. ""I regret very much having done so,'' he wrote.The second allegation of treason surround McCain’s signing of  a confession that he was a war criminal. He did sign such a statement -- after, he says, he was beaten routinely over the course of four days. Upon returning to the United States, McCain wrote, ""I reached the lowest point of my 5½ years in North Vietnam. I was at the point of suicide, because I saw that I was reaching the end of my rope.""McCain’s first-hand account is corroborated by Robert Timberg, author of John McCain: An American Odyssey. Timburg spoke to other POWs to write his biography of McCain. ""I've never known of any occasion in which Sen. McCain provided the North Vietnamese with anything of value,"" Timberg said.Even if you were to somehow buy the argument that McCain committed treason, the Revenge of the Herd article loses all credibility when it says McCain was pardoned.The article says that McCain and 33 other POWs faced a court martial for their crimes. President Richard Nixon issued a blanket pardon to all 34 POWs, including McCain.""I have developed a researchable data set of every individual grant of clemency from 1789 to present. I have been over the data (30,000 plus cases), dozens of times over the years. John McCain’s name simply does not appear in the data,"" Ruckman said.An article on Revenge of the Herd claims that ""John McCain was pardoned for treason.""During his time as a prisoner of war, McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. He was also forced to sign a confession that he was a war criminal.But there is no evidence of legal proceedings against McCain when he returned to the United States. And records of presidential pardons do not include McCain’s name.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

Clicking on it, you’d expect to hear a news anchor reporting on the news of Vin Diesel’s death.  But if you click on the video, you’ll actually hear the anchor say, ""Finally, I have some very sad news,"" before the clip freezes and is replaced by the words ""Share to Uncover This Video.""Clicking on those words opens up a pop-up window that allows you to share a link to the article on Facebook.We found after we shared the story, the video still would not load.A Nexis search revealed that no major news outlets have reported on Diesel’s death, and no obituaries have been written for him.We were unable to get in touch with the website where the article was posted, as we could not find any contact information for them.A story on a website, thth.mayatmenen.info, claims that actor Vin Diesel died ""after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set.""The article provides no evidence to support this claim, and no major news outlets are reporting that Diesel died."

Naturally, the woman then donned her bulletproof vest, busted out her personal AK-47 assault rifle and saved the officers by firing off 160 rounds at the gang members.That didn’t happen.We rate this story — written as a joke nearly three years ago — Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Washington Redskins weren't stranded by police at a game,"An online story says the Washington Redskins had an unplanned locker room slumber party.Clickbait site Universaleinfo posted the story on Aug. 5. It says that Redskins players knelt during the national anthem, angering the police officers providing security at the game. The cops decided to stage a counter-protest: they got down on one knee, yelled ""blue lives matter"" and then left the team in the locker room. Unable to get past the angry fans outside, the players were stuck all night.It’s a compelling story, aside from the fact none of it happened.The Universaleinfo article was posted on Aug. 5, 2018. It says that the Redskins knelt before their game on ""Monday night"" in Philadelphia. Aug. 5 was a Sunday, so previous Monday would have been six days before, on July 30.The article also said that the Philadelphia Police Department released a statement after the incident, but there were no recent press releases about the Redskins online. A spokesperson for the Redskins confirmed that there was no game on July 30.As far as we can tell, this article was entirely fabricated.The article is ""a boatload of bullhonkey,"" according to the disclaimer at the bottom of the Freedum Junkshun page. The related articles linked on the page are more of the same: football teams across the country, being punished in creative ways for not standing during the anthem.Universaleinfo posted an article that claimed, ""cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight.""None of the dates or information in the article match up to reality.

PANTS-FIRE,Rudy Giuliani gets facts wrong about Trump Tower meeting,"Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s attorney, said that members of Trump’s campaign had no reason to believe a key participant in the controversial Trump Tower meeting was working on behalf of the Russian government.Giuliani even suggested they may not have known she was Russian.""You asked me did they show an intention to do anything with Russians?"" Giuliani told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd. ""All they knew is that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she's not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing.""I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time,"" Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview.Giuliani’s claim is starkly at odds with the facts.On June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later.In emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton.""The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,"" Goldstone wrote.""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,"" he added, noting that a ""Russian government attorney"" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr.The younger Trump replied: ""If it’s what you say I love it.""Trump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.Days later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and campaign members met with a Russian national and several others. According to reports, at least eight people attended the meeting.The key Russian national was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone referred to in his email to Trump Jr. as a ""Russian government attorney.""Veselnitskaya later acknowledged having close connections with Russian prosecutors. In her capacity as an attorney, she has counted Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official among her clients.Veselnitskaya has denied having ever worked for the Russian government. But around the time of the meeting — and contrary to Giuliani’s claim — she entered the Trump orbit based on a promise that she was acting as a Russian government agent who could bruise the Clinton campaign.Giuliani said the Trump campaign ""didn’t know"" that Natalia Veselnitskaya ""was a representative of the Russian government"" or even Russian.Emails between Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion.Those emails show Trump senior’s business associate Rob Goldstone telling the younger Trump that a ""Russian government attorney"" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. to supply the campaign with incriminating evidence against Clinton.The younger Trump replied: ""If it’s what you say I love it"" — and several days later, the meeting took place.We rate this Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Will Hurd way off on foe getting more money from Massachusetts residents than from Texans,"Hurd aide cites second-quarter figuresMore than $500,000 via ActBlue?By Pfeiffer’s accounting, donations made to Jones’s campaign via ActBlue amounted to more than $581,000 of what Hurd considers Massachusetts donations. Not counting that money reduces Jones’s Massachusetts haul to such an extent that the result appears to be, by Hurd's accounting, more than $200,000 less than what Hurd says Jones raised in Texas.Longer viewAnd that result, we recognized, considers only the latest three months of donations reported by Jones to the FEC.A center analyst, Douglas Weber, replied that by its sort of itemized donations by individuals reported by Jones to the FEC, her campaign through June 2018 had raised $193,879 from Massachusetts residents and $353,293 from Texas residents. ""We generally do not count PAC contributions,"" Weber said by email, ""as many PACs are based in the D.C. area regardless of the organization.""Weber, asked about Hurd’s camp folding in donations conveyed through the ActBlue PAC, commented: ""They shouldn't include anything from ActBlue. ActBlue is a conduit--the address may be in Massachusetts but that's not where the contributions came from.""Pfeiffer, Hurd's spokesman, indicated by email that Hurd stands by what he said. Pfeiffer wrote: ""Based on the congressman's quote, the relevant question here is whether more money is flowing to Jones from Massachusetts than Texas. Jones is receiving a large amount of money from ActBlue, which is based in Massachusetts. What type of PAC ActBlue is does not change where they are based or the proximate source of the money flowing to Jones' campaign,"" Pfeiffer said.Our rulingHurd said Jones has raised ""more money from Massachusetts than"" from Texas.To the contrary, records show Jones raising more in campaign funds from Texans than Massachusetts residents. The congressman’s analysis erroneously rests on counting donations ferried to Jones from donors all over the country through the Massachusetts-based ActBlue PAC as contributions made solely by people living in Massachusetts.We find Hurd's statement incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Could this NC constitutional amendment make abortion illegal?,"This election, North Carolina voters will have the option of making six changes to the state Constitution.Among the most common criticisms of the proposal is that it might slow the legal system and add costs.""Victim’s rights will be extended to any class of people the legislature wants, including fetuses. This amendment will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina’s constitution,"" the Blue NC description of the victims’ rights amendment says.‘Who knows?’When contacted by PolitiFact, Protzman explained by email he’s critical of all six amendments because they’re vague. He pointed to this line in the legislation: ""The victim or, if the victim is a minor, is legally incapacitated, or deceased, a family member, guardian, or legal custodian may assert the rights provided in this section.""""So let’s say you’re the estranged husband of a woman who has an abortion. Under this amendment, you could assert all the rights of a family member on behalf of the fetus, and then impose the requirements of the amendment on your estranged wife. You could even assert, on behalf of the ‘victim,’ that felony murder took place,"" Protzman said.""Would this happen? Who knows? But it could. And given the willingness of Sen. Berger and Speaker Moore to bend legislative rules to suit their agendas, I wouldn’t bet against it,"" he added.‘Absurd’""The proposed amendment does not authorize a person to accuse someone of a crime or to make something a crime that is not already unlawful,"" Wallace said in an email.""Under the Constitution and current law, the aborted child is not treated as a victim of a crime,"" Wallace continued. ""The aborted child therefore would not have any rights under the proposed amendment, nor does the proposed amendment do anything to change current abortion law.""Marsy’s Law for NC, the group pushing the amendment, echoed that sentiment.""Marsy’s Law is not about abortion rights — it’s about strengthening rights for victims of crime,"" the group said through Chris Sinclair, general consultant for the Marsy’s Law for NC campaign.""Special interest groups are in high gear on social media spreading misinformation about Marsy’s Law, the amendment that will strengthen constitutional rights for victims of crime in North Carolina,"" the statement says. ""Their glib misinformation campaign is an attempt to mislead voters, and ultimately will hurt crime victims and their families who deserve equal rights in the state constitution - rights that the accused and convicted already have.""""I’m certainly open to hearing how this could/would be more common, but don’t think that this would be a common or even uncommon case."" The proposal is unlikely to pave the way for making abortion illegal, she said.Federal law trumps state law""Of the various critiques that have been advanced about these amendments during the campaigns — and there have been various critiques — concerns about the effects on abortion rights have not figured prominently in the debates and campaigns about the amendments,"" Dinan told PolitiFact in an email. ""Far more common have been concerns about whether these amendments will place an undue burden on prosecutors and court systems.""The proposed North Carolina constitutional amendment is no different, he said.""In looking at the original victims’ rights amendment (added to the North Carolina Constitution in 1996) and then examining the changes that would be made by the 2018 Marsy’s Law amendment, it is not clear to me which of the 2018 changes would have the claimed effect on abortion rights,"" Dinan said.""As long as there’s a federal constitutional rule on abortion, that trumps whatever North Carolina will do,"" Powell said.Our rulingBlueNC said the proposed victims’ rights constitutional amendment will ""pave the way for making abortion illegal."" Attorneys and legal experts say the path to such fallout not only is unclear, but unlikely. One expert described the claim as ""absurd."" And Protzman failed to offer evidence that an amendment which is completely unrelated to reproductive rights could outlaw abortion. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Roskam ad makes absurd claims about Democratic challenger’s health care stance,"It’s no surprise that Roskam, a six-term Republican incumbent fighting to keep his 6th District seat in the Western suburbs, doesn’t see eye-to-eye on health care with Sean Casten, a clean-energy entrepreneur from Downers Grove.Republicans have been complaining about the effects of Obamacare for years, but Roskam is taking some wild swings with this attack on Casten. There’s a lot here to unpack, so to keep it simple this fact-check focuses on the ad’s unsubstantiated health care claims.If it happened in the past it surely then will happen in the future, Vera reasoned, and so to the Roskam campaign that means Casten backs a doubling of premiums.One obvious problem with that line of thinking is that the Roskam campaign could provide no evidence that Casten had ever said such a thing.What’s more, experts say a major factor behind recent premium spikes on the individual market was uncertainty over the law’s future given frequent attempts by Roskam and other Republicans, including President Donald Trump, to kill or weaken Obamacare.Another 5.4 million Americans also purchased full-price individual insurance through the off-exchange plans that existed prior to Obamacare, according to Kaiser.""We’re really talking about maybe 2 percent of the population that’s paying full-price premiums for the individual market overall,"" said Cynthia Cox, a health reform and private insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation.""It's important to think about these people because the ACA was intended to make insurance more affordable,"" she said. ""But putting it into perspective, it's a relatively small share of the population.""Roskam’s other health care attack on Casten is also convoluted.The logic works this way: Obamacare shoppers had fewer options when picking plans for 2018, so that must mean that if Obamacare were expanded as Casten wants the options would narrow even further.""Expanding the ACA would mean limiting health care options for everyone affected,"" Vera wrote.And Obamacare also mandates minimum levels of coverage that did not exist prior to implementation of the health care law, which vastly expanded access to coverage for millions of Americans who previously had none, including those who didn’t qualify based on their health.""Before the ACA, if you had a pre-existing condition, there could be any number of plans to choose from, but you couldn’t get any of them,"" said Cox, the insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation.Roskam alleges that Casten supports ""doubling premiums"" and ""cutting current health care plans"" for Illinois families.Casten doesn’t support doubling premiums or reducing options—and Roskam’s campaign could point to nothing that said he did.The crux of Roskam’s argument centers on Casten’s support for expanding Obamacare options. Premiums on the federal exchange have spiked in past years, but Illinois’ largest insurer now says it expects them to go down slightly for 2019.What’s more, most Americans get insurance through employers, not Obamacare. But among those who do, most have been insulated from the full force of premium increases by federal subsidies.Health care policy has more wrinkles than a Shar Pei dog, and the complexity makes it easy for partisans to demagogue. Roskam’s claims are a clear example.They’re not just wrong, they’re absurd. We rate them Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Giuliani says there were 63 murders in Chicago over the weekend. That’s five times the actual count.,"63 murders this weekend in Rahm Emmanuel’s Chicago. His legacy more murders in his city than ever before. It’s only because of Democrat brain washing that he has even a chance of remaining. Support police professional Garry McCarthy.No and no.Giuliani’s attack was framed around an attempt to give a shout-out to one of Emanuel’s expected challengers in next year’s mayoral election, Garry McCarthy, the former Chicago Police superintendent fired by Emanuel in 2015. Except Giuliani misidentified McCarthy as ""Jerry"" instead of Garry.Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades. Policing genius Jerry McCarthy can do for Chicago what I did for NYC. He was one of the architects of Compstat. Slashed homicides over 70%. Tens of thousands of lives saved.The figure has since been updated. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department said Monday afternoon that a total of 66 people had been shot between 6 p.m. on Friday and midnight Sunday, 12 of them fatally.To put Giuliani’s claim in perspective, 63 gun-related deaths would be greater than the toll in last October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas where a gunman using high-powered weapons claimed 58 lives.The tweet storm from Giuliani fits into that pattern.There were too many shooting deaths in Chicago over the weekend, but nowhere near 63. And murders in Chicago began surging in 2016, but the numbers are still well below the city record of 970 set decades ago. The murder tally, while high under Emanuel, is nowhere near the worst in city history.But Giuliani is not only a former New York mayor, he was also once a crime-busting U.S. attorney in that city. If anyone should have a feel for what is real and unreal when it comes to urban violence, it’s Giuliani.Yet he disseminated a wildly exaggerated claim, and that is why we rate it Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the Nazi platform did not echo the Democratic platform, as Donald Trump Jr. said"," In it, the younger Trump echoed one of D’Souza’s themes that Democrats are a crypto-Nazi party.Really?If you read the Nazi platform without knowing its source, you could easily be forgiven for thinking you were reading the 2016 platform of the Democratic Party. Or a least a Democratic platform drafted jointly by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Sure, some of the language is out of date. The Democrats don’t talk about ""usury"" these days; they’d have to substitute ""Wall Street Greed."" But otherwise, it’s all there. All you have to do is cross out the word ""Nazi"" and write in the word ""Democrat.""We dug out the original Nazi platform from 1920 and consulted with historians of the period. There was wide agreement that D’Souza has made a dubious and overly simplified comparison of the Nazis and the Democrats while also overlooking large portions of the platform that couldn’t be further from present-day Democratic orthodoxy.The document is important, historians said, but it also requires a caveat.""It did not reflect all of Hitler’s views — it was a compromise,"" Breitman said. Some items — indeed, many of those that D’Souza says echo contemporary Democratic Party planks — are socialist. But even some of these are overlain with nationalist ideas more in tune with Hitler’s thinking, and overall, a majority of the planks articulate an extreme form of racial nationalism that is absent from modern-day Democratic platforms.The economic elements D'Souza emphasized need important context, said Laurie Marhoefer, a historian at the University of Washington who has studied the period.""The socialist elements in national socialism are in service to the racism,"" she said. ""That's very different from socialism itself, from social democracy, and from the Democrats in the United States, who aren't even social democrats.""• ""We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age.""• Support for ""the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement. ... We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the state.""• ""The state must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised.""In three other cases, it’s possible to cherry-pick language from the Nazi platform that echoes Democratic Party principles of equality, prosperity and freedom, but a closer look reveals important differences.• ""All citizens shall have equal rights and duties."" This sounds inoffensive, but elsewhere in the Nazi document, it offers an exclusionary definition of ""citizens"" — specifically, that ""only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.""• ""We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class."" This may sound like American political boilerplate, but the next clause defines the pathway to this goal as ""the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders."" There’s nothing in the Democratic platform about expropriating department stores for the benefit of small-business owners.• ""We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the state."" This sounds fine, but the sentence goes on to clarify, ""provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race.""The majority of points in the platform address issues that cannot be found in the Democratic Party platform.This element offers the starkest difference, experts said.And as harsh as some of its rhetoric is, the 1920 document actually underplays what Nazism eventually became.""Because Hitler wanted to create the image of consistency and infallibility, he never changed the program after he became Fuehrer of the party,"" Breitman said. ""He just continued to radicalize his views. When he gained power in 1933, he exploited opportunities to seize dictatorial control and then worked to expand party-state control of all aspects of life.""Trump Jr. said, ""You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar,' to a point where it's actually scary.""Only a small number of elements of the two platforms are clearly similar, and those are so uncontroversial that they appear in the Republican platform as well. The vast majority of planks in the Nazi platform not only don’t appear in the Democratic platform, but are wholly antithetical to it. We rate this Pants on Fire."

That too is false.Not only is there no mention of it in any remotely reliable news source (we checked on the Lexis-Nexis news database), but Eastwood just started a new film that he will both direct and act in called Mule.Shooting begins in the second half of July in Las Cruces, N.M.

PANTS-FIRE,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrong on several counts about unemployment," Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist and former organizer for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, attracted national attention after her upset primary victory over Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a Queens- and Bronx-based district. But critics pounced on some of her remarks during an interview on the PBS show Firing Line with Margaret Hoover.In our review, we found many reasons why unemployment is low, and not for the overwork that Ocasio-Cortez cited. The biggest factors include strong economic confidence and the long-running economic recovery. (Her campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps track of how many people work two jobs rather than just one.Over the past 12 months, the number of multiple job holders has ranged between 6 million and 7 million. That compares to more than 148 million Americans who are employed in a single job.So by the official statistics, multiple job holders account for a tiny fraction of American workers.And this percentage isn’t high by historical standards.The percentage has moved in a pretty narrow band — 4.7 percent to 5.2 percent — during the recovery from the Great Recession. That range is actually below where it was between 1994 and the Great Recession. In fact, the percentage was at its highest (as high as 6.5 percent) during the peak of the 1990s boom.This assertion is equally dubious.The Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down its count of people with multiple jobs into three categories: people working one full-time job and one part-time job; people with two part-time jobs; and people working two full-time jobs.A worker with two full-time jobs is the smallest category of the three.Since the entire pie chart is equivalent to the small red column in the previous graph, the people who might be working 70 or 80 hours a week amount to a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage — 310,000 people at most in a pool of employed Americans totaling more than 150 million.It’s also worth noting that on average, Americans aren’t working more today than they have been in the recent past. The average number of hours worked in the private sector has hugged tightly to about 34.5 hours a week since 2006, except for a dip during the Great Recession.When the BLS determines the unemployment rate, a person is counted as employed as long as they have at least one job. They don’t get counted twice if they have two jobs. So Ocasio-Cortez is wrong in saying multiple job holding and long hours affect the unemployment rate.It’s worth remembering that both of the factors Ocasio-Cortez cited — people working multiple jobs and long hours — are actually good things for the labor market, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.""Increases in the number of multiple job holders and longer average work hours almost always accompany a strengthening labor market — that is, a job market in which it is easier to find work, in which spells of unemployment are heading downwards, and in which the ranks of the unemployed are shrinking,"" Burtless said.Ocasio-Cortez said, ""Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family.""Even taking into account rhetorical excess, her statement is off in multiple ways. Fewer than one in 20 employed Americans holds a second job of any type, and the people who might be working as much as 70 or 80 hours a week represent a tiny fraction of that tiny fraction. The rates for either statistic are not high by historical standards.In any case, the BLS does not use either of those factors in determining the official unemployment rate.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

""They never paid any taxes.""Putin continued.""They sent a huge amount of money, over 400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""Well, that’s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal.""Did Browder's associates send $400 million to Hillary Clinton's campaign?No. We found $17,700 donated to Clinton and another $297,000 to the Democratic National Committee.We reached out to the Russian Embassy and the Russian consulate in Washington to get details on the $400 million donation and had not heard back in time for our deadline.Given that Veselnitskaya tied Browder and the Ziff brothers together, we researched their political donations.Browder became a British citizen and can’t legally contribute to U.S. candidates.

Here, the Ziffs mainly put their money into incumbents, and Republicans did better by a margin of about $145,000 to $46,000. Clinton’s campaign received $17,700.Unless Putin had other Browder associates in mind, his figure of $400 million going to the Clinton campaign is a massive exaggeration. Between the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, the Ziffs gave about $315,000.Putin said associates of Bill Browder gave $400 million to the Clinton campaign. The associates appear to be the Ziff brothers.

""I don't see any reason why it would be.""But the U.S. intelligence community, House and Senate panels led by Republicans, the special counsel’s team and members of Trump’s own administration have endorsed the view that Russia has interfered in American politics, in a practice that dates as far back as the Soviet era. Intelligence agencies have said the Kremlin directed the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.Fresh evidence of Moscow’s election interference emerged in indictments stemming from the special counsel’s investigation.In this latest indictment, the special counsel alleged that units operating under Moscow’s military intelligence agency conducted cyber operations that involved ""the staged releases of documents"" obtained through targeted computer hacking.""These units conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" the indictment states.Members of Trump’s own administration have endorsed a view at odds with the president.Coats, the director of National Intelligence, also issued a stern warning days before Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki. He compared the current threat of more Russian cyberattacks to warning signs before the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000.""It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet, the system is blinking red,"" Coats said. ""And here we are nearly two decades later, and I'm here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again.""Historians said the 2016 election was the first known example of a Russian attempt to sway a U.S. election in favor of a specific candidate, though there could have been additional attempts that remain classified or undiscovered.""If by ‘Russia’ one means post-1991 Russia, that statement (from Putin) appears to be correct based on publicly available information,"" said Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor specializing in democratization and authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union.But that does not mean the 2016 meddling was unprecedented. Way noted that Russia has frequently interfered in the elections of post-Soviet countries since the fall of the Soviet Union.Further, the Soviet Union worked in secret to help or hurt U.S. candidates at least four times during the Cold War era.""What we are seeing with Russia's active measures today are ‘unprecedented’ in that they use new tools and technologies … but the ends are very much older, and are straight from the KGB playbook,"" said Calder Walton, an expert in intelligence history and international relations at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. ""One can't understand Russian active measures to interfere in the 2016 election without understanding the long KGB history.""""There is a long history of the Kremlin interfering in internal U.S. affairs, including elections,"" Walton said. ""This included gathering compromising material on U.S. politicians, supporting Kremlin-favored candidates in U.S. elections, spreading forgeries and disinformation campaigns to inculcate distrust among the U.S. population in their government and Western allies.""Walton added that Putin’s claim is ""nonsense."" We've reached out to the Russian embassy and will update the fact-check if we hear back.Putin said, ""The Russian state has never interfered ... into internal American affairs including election process.""A mountain of evidence testifies to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate panel concluded independently of each other that Kremlin-directed operatives stole private data, used propaganda against particular candidates, and engaged in an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Republican-led House panel found in its own investigation that Russia conducted cyberattacks during the 2016 campaign.These findings are supported by indictments stemming from the special counsel’s investigation. There is no public evidence to suggest that the post-Cold War Russian government had previously interfered in a U.S. election at levels near the 2016 meddling, but the Soviet Union made several attempts to do so prior to its collapse in 1991.We rate this Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Good news: No man-eating rats in NYC,"Fortunately for everyone in New York City, a story about giant rats eating humans is a hoax.A story on sciencearticle.website said four homeless men were eaten alive, a gruesome narrative accompanied by photos of large rats held by sanitation workers and lying on a table.The warnings of 40-pound rats gnawing on unconscious humans isn’t true.When we asked the city about it, a health department spokeswoman Carolina Rodriguez said, ""The only giant mutant rat in New York City is Master Splinter, and we all know he is partial to pizza just like another famous New York City rat.""She explained that most rats in the city are Norway rats, which grow between 12 to 18 inches, with 5- to 6-inch tails. At most, they weigh about a pound.According to Rodriguez, the health department has not received any reports of rat attacks.This article also includes three pictures, all of which are gross.The image is reposted a second time within the article, although this time altered to make it appear that it was broadcast on the news. A breaking news runner gives the image an authentic look, but the fake ""5 NEWS"" logo and the ""smhwtfnews.com"" link make it clear that the screenshot was fabricated.Both the giant swamp rat and the forced perspective images have been shared widely across fake news sites to ""prove"" that giant rats were caught in London, Hong Kong, and other urban areas across the world.This article alleges that four men have died after being eaten by giant-sized rats.

PANTS-FIRE,George Soros not headed to jail over campaign contributions,"Billionaire George Soros has made his final donation, according to some conservative bloggers.A May article in Right Wing News says that nearly $2 billion of his money was ""intercepted"" and that the investor could go to jail for years.This article, which has been shared over 5,000 times on Facebook, is not true.Lately, Soros has focused on changing the justice system by donating to local district attorney candidates who pledge to act tougher on police brutality cases and be more aware of racial issues in policing.The Right Wing News post frames this as the grounds for Soros’s arrest. But who intercepted the money? What was the crime? We decided to investigate.The headline of this article, which states that the money was intercepted and that Soros could be headed to jail, is widely unsupported by evidence. It is also unsupported by the article itself, which never explains or even mentions legal action being brought against Soros.It is true that Soros and other liberal groups have donated huge sums of money to candidates who want to crack down on police brutality. However, a Los Angeles Times graphic shows that Soros donated about $19 million to 21 prosecutor campaigns across the country since 2014. In California, he has spent $2.7 million.This is a far cry from $1.8 billion spent on four campaigns in California, as Right Wing News claimed. The headline’s claim that this money was intercepted by someone was also unsupported by the body of the post and any other sources.Right Wing News repurposed existing news articles about district attorney elections in California to make it appear that George Soros had donated 100 times more money than he had. The website then headlined this article with two baseless claims: that Soros’s donations had been intercepted, and that he was likely to go to prison.Soros is not in legal trouble for his donations to district attorney campaigns, has only donated $2.7 million in California, and none of his money was intercepted by a third party.Due to a completely fabricated headline and incorrect numbers, we rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Leah Vukmir's Pants on Fire claim about Mark Pocan proposal to abolish ICE,"Would a Wisconsin congressman’s proposal to eliminate ICE really mean no more enforcement of the U.S. borders?No.Here’s why Vukmir’s blanket statement goes way wrong.Pocan’s proposalPocan instead alluded to ICE actions taken inside the United States, accusing a unit of the agency of ""hunting down and tearing apart families"" at churches and schools, and raiding places such as garden centers and meatpacking plants.But Pocan isn’t proposing to get rid of border enforcement  — and ICE isn’t the agency that patrols the borders, anyway.What is ICE?Customs and Border Protection is responsible for enforcement at the border and 100 miles in from any point on the border of the U.S., land and water. Eliminating ICE would not eliminate CBP or enforcement at the border.While certain responsibilities and close cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and others require significant ICE assets near the border, the majority of immigration enforcement work for ICE takes place in the country’s interior.Not abandoning enforcementIndeed, Pocan has been clear that he is not proposing to end border enforcement.Amusing, perhaps, but it didn’t help his boss.Our ratingVukmir says Pocan’s proposal to eliminate ICE would ""eliminate border enforcement.""But enforcing the border is not even ICE’s job. Rather, the federal agency pursues unauthorized immigrants who are already inside the country.A different federal agency is responsible for patrolling the border, so border enforcement would continue even if ICE were eliminated. And, in any case, Pocan is not proposing to end border enforcement."

The gang grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s.For this fact check, we examined the tweet about Harris. We also reviewed similar attacks.Harris repudiates claim""As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That’s being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.""Harris was California’s attorney general and San Francisco’s district attorney before she was elected to the Senate in 2016.

They’ve also called for reforming, or in some cases abolishing, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, and replacing it with a new agency.They have not, however, explicitly called for ending immigration enforcement.

PANTS-FIRE,Larry Kudlow wrong about deficits falling rapidly under Donald Trump,"The economy under President Donald Trump, Kudlow said on June 29, ""is throwing out enormous amounts of new tax revenues. As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers -- those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms (of Trump’s economic policy), is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems.""However, that assertion is questionable as well. The most trusted source for future budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office, shows rising deficits for years into the future.In fiscal year 2016, which was also under Obama, the deficit rose to $585 billion.In fiscal year 2017, which was about two-thirds on Trump’s watch, the deficit rose to $665 billion.So on a full-year basis, Kudlow is wrong.For fiscal year 2018, CBO projects a deficit of $804 billion, rising each successive year to $981 billion in 2019, $1 trillion in 2020, $1.1 trillion in 2021, and $1.3 trillion in 2022.The deficit is also poised to increase as a percentage of GDP --  from 3.5 percent in 2017 to 4.0 in 2018 and eventually to 5.4 percent in 2022.Here’s the full chart from CBO’s most recent projections, released in April.Not only that, but CBO specifically cited the tax cut Trump backed and signed into law as a reason for spiraling deficits.""The deficit that CBO now estimates for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected for that year in June 2017,"" CBO wrote in its April report. ""Accounting for most of that difference is a $194 billion reduction in projected revenues, mainly because the 2017 tax act is expected to reduce collections of individual and corporate income taxes.""And the projections would be even worse if Congress doesn’t allow the recent round of tax cuts to expire. ""In that scenario, far larger deficits and much greater debt would result than in CBO’s baseline projections for the 2019–2028 period,"" CBO wrote.Kudlow said, ""The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly."" After being criticized, he later clarified that he ""probably should have said future deficits.""Kudlow’s first formulation is wrong, and his revised version isn’t supported by the most widely trusted barometer -- projections by the CBO. Trump tax bill, which dramatically cut revenues, is a big reason why.The statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Putnam parrots previous absurd claim on food stamps for illegal immigrants,"The top two Republicans running for governor in Florida, Adam Putnam and Ron DeSantis, tried to paint a picture that the other was weak on immigration issues during a nationally televised debate on Fox News June 28, 2018.Moderator Bret Baier of Fox News asked Putnam, the state’s agriculture commissioner, to respond to a DeSantis’ attack ad calling him ""Amnesty Adam.""Putnam shot back, ""That’s rich for somebody who voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants.""Off-screen, DeSantis, a Florida congressman who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, responded, ""That’s not true, you know that, come on.""So, is that true?The bill mentioned illegal immigrants briefly, in Section 4015, to mandate that states would be ""required to use an immigration status verification system"" when distributing food assistance benefits.Putnam and his supporters frequently cite these votes as evidence that DeSantis was in favor of extending SNAP to people in the country illegally.The thinking goes that by voting against the farm bill in total, DeSantis voted against a provision that sought to verify that food assistance benefits only went to U.S. citizens.As a result, Putnam and his supporters claim, DeSantis supported distributing food assistance benefits without a citizenship test. And therefore, he supported distributing food assistance benefits to people in the country illegally.Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told PolitiFact in March 2018, ""Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens.""Specifically, he was concerned that the bill did not do enough to cut back the rising cost of food stamp program—a far cry from wanting to expand it to include illegal immigrants.Putnam claimed DeSantis ""voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants."" DeSantis actually voted against the bill, and explained later it had nothing to do with provisions related to immigration.Putnam has cast the vote against the farm bill as somehow allowing people living in the country illegally to receive food assistance benefits.But the practice was prohibited before the 2014 vote, and it remained prohibited after the 2014 vote.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Is claim that Austin soccer plan is a $1 billion giveaway on target or worth a red card?,"It’s an alarming contention: The Austin City Council is poised to ""give"" more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return as it seeks to lure a Major League Soccer team.""Imagine what else we could do with another billion dollars to make our city even better,"" intones the video’s youthful-looking narrator. He raises the prospect of using the money to instead fund annual pay raises for Austin school teachers, ""full-ride scholarships"" to the University of Texas for every local high school graduate, or newly built homes ""for every single homeless person in the city of Austin.""Setting aside that no formal proposals exist to spend $1 billion on any of those items, we were curious whether it’s accurate to say the City Council will be handing such an amount to a private company and getting nothing in return if it approves the agreement for the soccer stadium as it currently is formulated?A representative of the anti-stadium group contacted by PolitiFact Texas said the $1 billion figure is based on simple math and actually is conservative.But two professors who study publicly funded economic incentives said the group’s analysis is off base, with one calling the $1 billion amount that the group came up with ""crazy"" and the other saying it ""doesn’t pass the sniff test.""The city would own the land and the stadium, so Precourt wouldn’t pay any property taxes on the facility. The initial lease would last for 20 years, with three options for Precourt to renew it under the same terms.The anti-stadium group, which initially answered questions from PolitiFact Texas through e-mail but didn’t respond to a follow-up request for a phone interview, said it arrived at the ""$1 billion giveaway"" figure by first calculating the estimated property taxes that would be owed by Precourt if it owned the land, instead of leasing it from the city, and also made $250 million worth of improvements on it, which the anti-stadium group pegged as the value of the soccer stadium.The group then took that figure, based on 2017 property tax rates, and multiplied it by 80 years — the maximum term of the proposed lease, assuming all options were exercised. It also assumed 2.5 percent annual growth in local property values, arriving at its $1 billion-plus total.But Clint Peinhardt, a University of Texas at Dallas political science professor, said such an analysis has many holes, not the least of which is that 80 years is simply too long a time period to forecast accurately.Who knows, for instance, if soccer will even be played in 80 years, or if it will become so huge in the United States that it tops football in terms of a loyal fan base. What’s more, the anti-stadium group’s analysis doesn’t factor in depreciation, which would have a major impact on the value of the facility and the tax calculation. Or the possibility that the lease would not be renewed by the soccer team’s ownership. Or the potential for something even more outlandish — such as a meteor destroying the site and rendering the entire exercise moot.""Anything that far out in the future — 80 years — is a pretty crazy thing to try to guess,"" Peinhardt said. ""In general, that is just a huge time frame.""As a result, Peinhardt and Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin professor of government, said it’s too much of a leap of logic to simply add up the value of property taxes that wouldn’t be due for decades and then contend city leaders are ""giving them away"" in the present if they approve the stadium plan. They said the ""time value of money"" — whereby a dollar today is worth much more than a theoretical dollar in the future — just doesn’t work that way.The pair also noted that the anti-stadium group’s analysis assumes no benefits to the city — in terms of jobs, tourism or nearby development — to offset the purported $1 billion cost to taxpayers. While taxpayer incentives for a soccer stadium might not be the most ""revenue-maximizing"" path for the city to choose for the McKalla site — particularly since other plans recently have been proposed for the tract — they said the potential positives should be considered along with the negatives. There is also the detail that, as currently proposed, the city would still own the stadium outright if the team’s ownership didn’t renew the deal.Jensen described himself as a critic of the current stadium plan, but he nonetheless dismissed the anti-stadium group’s number, saying it isn’t ""a credible calculation"" or a serious fiscal analysis.Our rulingA video by an anti-stadium group claims the Austin City Council is poised to give more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return.While the City Council could potentially provide incentives worth millions of dollars as part of the soccer stadium deal, the scary ""$1 billion giveaway"" language of the video simply doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny. The lengthy time frame invoked and the countless unknown events that could impact the deal make the math used in the video meaningless. Factor in that the video also doesn’t account for any return on the city’s investment, and it is clear that the contentions are off base  — and ridiculous.We rate the claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Fake news says Pope called for world wide gun confiscation except for the UN,"We reached out to Hodges through his website to learn the source behind his statement. We didn’t hear back.We searched the Nexis database of news reports and did not find anything that backed up this claim, but it’s possible that he’s conflated a couple of speeches from the pope.Speaking of the Middle East and Africa, he decried the situations where innocent people ""have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement.""In that speech, Francis spoke of ""the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community.""If that’s the source of Hodges’ statement, it doesn’t match what he described. There’s no call for universal collection of guns, nor did he specify that the United Nations would be the only group that can coordinate military interventions.In fact, when the pope visited Central African Republic, his call for peace between warring Christian and Muslim factions acknowledged there is an appropriate role for arms.Pope Francis opposed the unjust use of weapons, meaning in his eyes, there can be a just use of weapons.The pope was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry.In the minds of some, that translated into the pope saying that gun owners can’t be Christians.An online program said Pope Francis had called for worldwide gun confiscation, except for the United Nations.The pope has not said those words or called for such a change. The most generous reading is that this is based on interpretations of remarks the Pope has made about regional and ethnic conflicts.In keeping with Christian doctrine, one would expect the pope to speak against violence. What is striking is even with that, the pope said that there can be just uses of weapons.We shoot down another bit of fake news and rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump says people went out on their boats to watch Hurricane Harvey,"President Donald Trump paused from extolling the Coast Guard for rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S. in 2017 to suggest that people had foolishly gotten in boats to watch Hurricane Harvey.Did people do that?We didn’t recall that happening and the next day, we failed to draw elaboration on Trump’s claim from the White House nor did other agencies respond with information showing that people took boats out to watch the powerful hurricane that swept ashore at Rockport, Texas before touching off days of heavy rain and flooding in Houston and southeast Texas.""I also want to recognize the Coast Guard, our other military services.

PANTS-FIRE,Blago op-ed falsely claims he is in prison for ‘practicing politics',"There’s little need to rehash the saga of Rod Blagojevich, Illinois’ 40th governor and the only one ever impeached. For the last six years he has been locked up in a federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, serving a 14-year sentence for convictions on an array of corruption charges, including a spectacularly brazen attempt to sell his power as governor to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the ascension of Barack Obama to the presidency.Blagojevich has exhausted all appeals through the courts to get his conviction overturned or the sentence reduced. Lately, his family and some diehard supporters have made noises about seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, who once featured Blagojevich on his Celebrity Apprentice TV show and who, judging by his tweets, has his own beef with aggressive prosecutors.Against that backdrop, federal prisoner number 40892-424 this week penned a column in the conservative opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal, owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch who is tight with Trump. Murdoch also owns the conservative Fox News Channel, which the president is known to binge watch.Blagojevich framed his column as a cautionary tale to other politicians, warning that he had been hounded unfairly by an out-of-control Justice Department ""abusing their power to criminalize the routine practices of politics and government.""""I’m in Prison for Practicing Politics,"" the headline on his opinion article declared.All of which raises some provocative questions. Is Blagojevich really the victim here, as he clearly suggests? And was he sent to prison for merely doing the same things other politicians and government officials routinely do?First, a note of explanation. The authors of this fact-check have more than a passing knowledge of Blagojevich. One covered every moment of both his federal corruption trials as a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, the other also as a Tribune reporter covered the federal investigation that led to Blagojevich’s indictment and later co-authored a book chronicling his political rise and fall.The portrait that emerged from that up-close observation was of a leader sublimely self-righteous, comically vain, untrustworthy, uninterested in the process of governing, unsophisticated in the arts of policy and deal making and not particularly discriminating in whose counsel he sought.As governor, he waged a bitter public battle with his father-in-law, who had been his political mentor. Another top adviser and fundraiser went to prison in corruption schemes that served as a precursor to Blagojevich’s own indictment. Another top fundraiser committed suicide after pleading guilty to federal charges in a kickback scheme.On the day he was sentenced in December 2011, Blagojevich fell on his sword before U.S. District Judge James Zagel, appearing to own his misdeeds in a plea for mercy that did not work.""My life is ruined,"" he told Zagel. ""I have nobody to blame but myself for my stupidity and actions and words and what I thought I could do. I’m not blaming anybody.""But in his Wall Street Journal article, Blagojevich made clear that he was no longer blaming himself as he accused prosecutors and the FBI of abusing their powers to bring him down.""Here I am in my sixth year of a 14-year prison sentence for the routine practice of attempting to raise campaign funds while governor,"" he wrote.Blagojevich’s legal team raised that defense at trial, but jurors rejected it.Acting on a tip from a longtime Blagojevich confidant, government agents received court approval to wiretap phones in the governor’s home and political office. It was evidence gathered from those wiretaps, much of it from Blagojevich’s own mouth, that served as the centerpiece of the case against him.Over two separate trials, Blagojevich was convicted on 18 criminal counts including wire fraud, bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Five of those counts were later tossed on appeal, but the crimes for which he still stands convicted include:Among wiretaps played at trial were some that captured Blagojevich discussing a scheme to appoint a longtime political adversary to the post, then U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., in exchange for $1.5 million in political donations.Prosecutors said they arrested Blagojevich in December 2008 to prevent him from pulling the trigger on that deal.""I’m in prison for practicing politics,"" read the headline on the article by the former Illinois governor.Blagojevich and his legal team also made the ""politics as usual, nothing to see here"" argument during his trials, but such claims were soundly rejected by federal jurors. Over two trials, they convicted him of multiple criminal counts stemming from his conduct in office.Much of the evidence presented at those trials stemmed from court-ordered wiretaps on which Blagojevich was heard scheming to carry out the very crimes for which he was convicted.Blagojevich was contrite about his actions at his sentencing, appearing to own up to misdeeds. Now, in playing the victim card, he is attempting to take that all back. But Blagojevich’s own words and deeds proved his undoing.Illinois has certainly suffered its share of public corruption, and skepticism about politicians abounds. But Blagojevich’s ""everybody does it"" argument seems an over-the-top exercise in desperation and self-pity.We give his claims our lowest credibility rating, Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump said a New York Times source in the White House doesn't exist. He does," Most Americans aren’t glued to Twitter over the Memorial Day weekend, but that didn’t stop a controversy this year, pitting President Donald Trump against journalists who cover the White House.""On Thursday, for example, a senior White House official told reporters that even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed,"" the article said.They said the official did indeed exist; in fact, he had conducted ""an off-camera, not for broadcast, background briefing on North Korea,"" in the wording of the White House email that had announced it on May 24.The briefing had been held in the White House press room and was opened up to reporters elsewhere via a conference call line. Under the ground rules of a ""background briefing,"" reporters cannot use the name of the specific official and instead must use a more vague descriptor.I share my colleagues’ conclusion- the sr official whose existence the president disputes certainly appears to be same sr official who briefed 100+ of us in person and via conf call from WH. Brfng conducted on condition it be on bck with no audio/video distrib.So what’s going on here? We did our own review. We found Trump was wrong in saying that the source ""doesn’t exist"" and was ""phony."" Evidence shows Trump's own White House arranged the briefing with the official.PolitiFact will reprint the briefer’s name for a few reasons: It is needed to full address the accuracy of Trump’s charge; the information is now readily available on the Internet; and we were not a participant in the original briefing and did not agree to keep it on background.The briefer was Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council’s senior director for Asian affairs.Here’s a transcript of the audio segment Ali tweeted:The White House declined to either confirm or deny to PolitiFact that Pottinger was the briefer. But the audio speaks for itself.If that was Trump's gripe, it isn't what he said. The White House source did exist. We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, a German submarine wasn't just discovered in Great Lakes","A headline would have readers believe that a ship discovered at the bottom of Lake Ontario by the Coast Guard is a German submarine, but this is fake news that has circulated for years.The story said that amateur scuba divers first spotted the boat in January and contacted authorities. Then, the story went, archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard determined that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II and recovered it.But we found no legitimate news articles stating that such a sunken ship was recently discovered.The story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at the Niagara University. Thomas Burns, a spokesman for the university, said they do not have a professor by that name.The Coast Guard told PolitiFact that the story about a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. However, something similar has happened in the past.""Years ago the Navy brought a WWII submarine onto the Great Lakes and at some point sank the submarine. So there is a WWII submarine sunken in the Great Lakes, but the Coast Guard didn’t work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement.The German mine-laying sub U-C 97 was brought to the midwest on tour in the summer of 1919.""The U-Boat was on tour. It was kind of a post-war, 'we won' tour, and so people got to go on to it and see it, and then as a condition of the armistice, it had to be sunk,"" Pritzker Military Library CEO Ken Clarke told ABC news.In June of 1921, the sub was sunk by the military.But in this case, the story declaring that a mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII was discovered in Great Lakes is made up.

But his team denied any Paris meeting with Iranians took place.What does this have to do with Kerry ""facing prison""?But the Conservative Stories website, which has no contact information, provided no actual evidence that Kerry was found in violation of the act and faces prison.So, to recap:Whether Kerry and the Iranians met is contended. As such;There is no evidence Kerry violated the Logan Act. And even if he did;Nobody has been convicted of violating the Logan Act, ever.A headline said ""Just in: John Kerry facing prison."" The story relies on a tweet that showed Kerry was in Paris -- that part is true. But the allegations that Kerry was meeting with Iranian officials in an attempt to salvage the international nuclear agreement are unproven. So saying he violated any law is nothing more than guesswork. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Pants on Fire for attack that, without evidence, links U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin with 9/11 mastermind","It’s an attack that appears to question the Wisconsin Democrat’s patriotism.And if it’s correct, where is the evidence?As stated, Vukmir’s claim draws a conclusion based on what is publicly known about Baldwin’s stance toward Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Let’s examine if the evidence matches the rhetoric.‘Team Terrorists’Tammy and her party are more interested, and they’re more worried about, the mastermind of 9/11 -- the individual that plotted and ultimately killed over 3,000 Americans on our soil. And she‘s more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the CIA.No evidenceIn any case, Baldwin’s support or opposition to Haspel is not what we’re fact checking here.When we asked Vukmir’s campaign staff for evidence to support Vukmir’s claim that Baldwin is ""more worried"" about Mohammed than supporting Haspel, it was lacking.Latest fact checks on the Senate candidates:The article reported on Mohammed’s request to share six paragraphs of unspecified information about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, before the committee voted to recommend Haspel’s confirmation. Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article.The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed.About BaldwinTwo other points are worth noting:Baldwin did not call for Mohammed’s testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. (She is not a member of the panel.)In short, Vukmir provided nothing of substance to support linking Baldwin with a terrorist.Our ratingVukmir says Baldwin is ""more worried about the mastermind of 9/11"" than supporting Trump’s nominee for CIA director.She provided no information to back up an extreme claim that Baldwin has serious concern for a terrorist that it is motivating her not to support the nominee.We rate Vukmir’s statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Did Donald Trump sign the first military pay raise in 10 years?," President Donald Trump opened up the White House for a celebration of military mothers and spouses.At the May 9 gathering, Trump signed an executive order to increase federal-agency hiring of military spouses.Trump brought up his role earlier this year in signing the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018, the typical legislative vehicle for providing pay increases for the military.""We just approved $700 billion for our military,"" Trump said. ""So we’re going to be having the best equipment ever known.  And next year, $716 billion. So I wanted to let you know. And, by the way — I know you don’t care about this — but that also includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years.""That’s flat wrong. In fact, the last time that service members didn’t receive an annual pay increase was in 1983.And that was only because of a one-time technical quirk.Trump was ""totally incorrect,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The military has gotten a pay raise each and every year.""The increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. But there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.1 percent. For 2019, the White House is proposing a 2.6 percent increase; the bill to enact that pay raise is working its way through Congress.So how about that missing increase in 1983? That was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the government’s fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year, Harrison said.Beyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase.Trump said that recent legislation ""includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years.""That’s wrong. Depending how you count it, the most recent year without a military pay raise was either 35 or 57 years ago — not 10. And the most recent pay raise wasn’t even the biggest in the past 10 years; it was exceeded by raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, during the Bush and Obama administrations.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

Mack was indeed indicted, but the tie to the Rothschilds or Clintons is made up.On Smallville, Mack played the role of Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark Kent’s best friends, starting in 2001.Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere.""The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,"" stated Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.Raniere established a series of purported self-help programs within his umbrella organization Nxivm, based in Albany. Prosecutors said that Nxivm maintained features of a pyramid scheme, as its courses cost thousands of dollars each and participants (""Nxians"") were encouraged to recruit others.In 2015, Raniere created a secret society within Nxivm called DOS, an acronym that stands for a Latin phrase that loosely translates to ""Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions,"" or ""The Vow,"" according to prosecutors. DOS operated with levels of women ""slaves"" headed by ""masters.""  Raniere stood at the top of the pyramid while Mack was one of the women in the first level immediately below Raniere.While The Newly Press article said that Mack confessed, court records show Mack pleaded not guilty on April 20. She was released on $5 million bail bond and is staying at her parents’ home in California under electronic monitoring.  The Newly Press story provided no evidence that Mack confessed to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons.

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump falsely says James Comey memos disprove collusion, obstruction","President Donald Trump claimed that memos written by former FBI Director James Comey ""show clearly"" that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election, and that Trump has not obstructed justice amid ensuing investigations.""James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,"" Trump tweeted.James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?Comey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trump’s tweet badly mischaracterizes their contents.Nowhere in Comey’s memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice.Let’s recap how the memos came to be.In July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump.On May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia.Here’s the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasn’t in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not.To date, Mueller’s investigation has swept up four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Mueller’s team as part of a plea deal. Mueller’s probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question.The idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker.For starters, Comey’s memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump.The memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a ""patronage relationship"" with him.Comey’s memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.""The memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.""Finally, two days after Comey’s ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that he’d been thinking about the FBI’s Russia investigation when he fired Comey.""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt.As in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice.Even when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still don’t support his claim that the writings exonerate him.Comey’s memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to ""lift the cloud"" being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him.But Comey’s final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey.""One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Mueller’s team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. It’s certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble.""Trump said the Comey memos ""show clearly"" that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice.Nowhere in Comey’s memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals.In his book, Comey writes that the memos and the circumstances of his firing may be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing.We rate this Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Did Congress vote to give itself a pay raise this year? No," A Republican candidate for Montana’s U.S. Senate seat painted his opponent, Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, as a greedy Washington insider by claiming Tester voted to give himself a pay raise this year.Matt Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said Tester’s compensation bump was part of the $1.3 trillion ""omnibus"" spending bill signed into law March 23.""If you send me to Washington, D.C.,"" Rosendale said, ""no more will we have a senator who takes and votes against tax cuts for you, while he just took an income raise in the omnibus bill.""Tester did indeed vote for this year’s Consolidated Appropriations Act, a spending package that funds everything from the military, to assistance for the nation’s opioid problem to border security. But Rosendale’s claim that Congress received a pay raise is flat wrong.Montana state Auditor Matt Rosendale announces his bid for the U.S. Senate on July 31, 2017. (AP/Bobby Caina Calvan)The Constitution requires Congress to determine its own salary. The Framers deemed in Article I, Section 6 that, ""the Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law.""In 1789, senators and representatives earned $6 a day for attending congressional sessions. But a law signed that year bumped senators’ pay up to $7 a day — the first congressional pay raise in American history.Fast forward about 200 years and you’ll find the last instance that Congress enacted specific legislation to change its pay. Since around 1989, pay has been determined by laws that use formulas to automatically adjust members’ wages.Here’s a snapshot of how members’ salaries changed over several years under a law that codified a pay adjustment formula:As the chart above shows, most senators and representatives earned an annual salary of $174,000 in 2009. That year is significant for another reason: it’s when Congress stopped giving itself raises.Yes, you read that correctly. Members’ salary levels were frozen in 2009. Lawmakers achieved this through a series of laws blocking their scheduled yearly adjustments.For Rosendale to be correct that Tester voted himself a raise, the 2018 omnibus would have to have resume Congress’ yearly pay bump.So, did it? Nope.As this Congressional Research Service chart notes, members’ salaries in 2018 is $174,000 — the same as it’s been since 2009. (There are exceptions for Speaker of the House, who makes $223,500, and the President pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, who make $193,400.)An aide to Rosendale said the candidate had been referring to the roughly $49 million increase in the Senate’s operating budget, as well as $12 million in salary increases for officers and other employees, which resulted from the omnibus spending bill.But Rosendale said Tester took an ""income raise."" It’s hard to imagine he was referring to anyone other than Tester.Rosendale said Tester ""took an income raise in the omnibus bill.""Congress’ pay has been frozen at $174,000 per member since 2009. Under the omnibus spending bill, it remains frozen through 2018. Rosendale has no basis for his claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!"

""It is possible to tell this because when we have had things in orbit around the Moon, how they orbit in the Moon's gravity tells us about the mass of the Moon.

A story about Aldrin witnessing space aliens went viral.The post went on to say that Aldrin and other astronauts -- Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper -- ""gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions."" Specifically, the post said, the four ""took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio.""One problem with the story: Cooper died in 2004, while Mitchell died in 2016. Worden is 86.Another problem with the post: It said that Aldrin had said ""he was a spaceship on his way to the Moon,"" the post said, when he saw ""something out there that was close enough to be observed … sort of L-shaped."" According to the post, Aldrin passed a test akin to a lie detector, only ""more reliable.""""On Apollo 11 (en) route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world -- it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be ‘unidentified.’""We well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that I had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.Bottom line: In the Reddit session, Aldrin clearly rejected any suggestion that the light he saw was some sort of of space alien.A representative for Aldrin told PolitiFact that the lie-detector angle is bogus as well.""We don’t know where this new UFO story came from,"" said Christina Korp, vice president of marketing, media and business development for Aldrin. ""Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO.""Referring to the light he mentioned in the Reddit session, Korp said, ""Buzz has been very clear on this over the years and has never wavered in his description of it. He does not believe in UFOs. ... This is not the first time someone has tried to capitalize on using Buzz’s name to make headlines.""Various websites ran articles with headlines claiming that Buzz Aldrin passed a lie detector test claiming he ""encountered alien life.""  However, a spokeswoman for Aldrin said the retired astronaut never took any type of ""lie-detector"" test. Meanwhile, Aldrin was clear in the Reddit session three years ago that he felt an unusual  light he saw during space flight had prosaic origins and was not an alien.We rate this Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,No proof of Trump's conspiracy theory that millions voted many times,"In a speech in West Virginia that was billed as being about tax reform, President Donald Trump continued his refrain about widespread voter fraud by stating that millions of people vote multiple times.Is there evidence that millions and millions of people have voted many times? No, there's not. But we will summarize the research on this topic. National experts have said that voter fraud is isolated and rare -- and the same holds true for voting multiple times, a phenomenon called double voting.We contacted Trump’s spokesman to ask for evidence and didn’t get a reply.The researchers estimated that 33,000 votes, or .02 percent of the votes cast, could have been double votes, but they called that an upper-bound estimate.""We would expect to estimate there were around 33,000 double voters even if there were no actual double votes cast,"" they wrote.The paper concluded that there was almost no chance that double votes could affect the outcome of a national election.As of 2014, 28 participating states provided the program with their registration records. The states received a list of registrations in their own state that matched the first name, last name, and date of birth recorded on a registration in another member state.In the 2012 election, Crosscheck flagged more than 1.4 million registrations as potential duplicates that member states should further scrutinize.There have been some investigations into double voting, some of which led to prosecutions, but they are rare -- far, far less than millions of votes.Using the database, we counted 80 criminal conviction cases for duplicate voting between 2001 and 2017. (In a few cases, two individuals were convicted.)Voting experts such as Loyola law professor Justin Levitt said that no research backs up Trump’s statement.""There is zero evidence for President Trump’s claim that there are millions and millions of double voters,"" he said. ""Zero.""Trump said, ""In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people.

We will take action where it counts.""Those comments were preceded by a specific list of legislative demands that included an assault weapons ban, the ""prohibition of high capacity magazines, reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes.""Alex Wind, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, used the words ""life"" and ""death"" to describe where politicians stand on gun restrictions.D’Angelo McDade, a student from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago and members of the student non-violence group the Peace Warriors, specifically called for non-violent action.""When will we as a nation understand that we are not here to fight against one another and we are here to fight for life and peace?"" McDade said. ""Dr. King once said, ‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.’ Which now leads me to say that violence cannot drive out violence, only peace can do that.""Our rulingBoswell said ""many speakers"" at the March for Our Lives rallies were calling for ""the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government.""

PANTS-FIRE,Gun owners would not have to give up their guns under 'assault weapons' ban,"The president of the state group affiliated with the National Rifle Association says a bill in Congress would ban all semi-automatic firearms and lead to the government seizing guns from gun owners.Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, appeared on The Capitol Pressroom to voice his group’s opposition to stronger gun control laws.The group also wants to repeal the 2013 New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, the state’s gun law passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.Democrats have proposed some parts of the SAFE Act for the congressional bill, like universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on certain accessories.But is King right that the bill would ban semi-automatic weapons altogether and lead to gun seizures?The billOpponents of gun control have long chafed at the term ""assault weapon"" because it does not have a universal definition. The SAFE Act, for example, defines an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons in 1994.The federal ban expired in 2004, and many Democrats have tried to revive it ever since.King did not respond to our inquiry about his claim. In the Capitol Pressroom interview, he mentioned House Resolution 5057 as the bill he was referring to. But that bill has nothing to do with guns.It seems he mixed up his bill numbers. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, leads the latest gun-control effort as sponsor of House Resolution 5087, titled the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. A Cicilline spokesperson said his office is not aware of any other current bills relating to an assault weapons ban. PolitiFact New York could not find any others in our search of House and Senate websites. Cicilline's bill would ban the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with certain military-style features:Semi-automatic weapons sold without any of those features would still be legal to own and sell. The gun would become illegal if the owner decided to add any of those features.Those who legally bought a gun with those features before the ban would not have to give them up. Those weapons would be grandfathered in, but a background check would be required if the owner sells it to someone else. They would also have to be locked up when not being used.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, introduced an almost identical bill in 2017. Neither has support from Republicans, who hold the majority in both chambers of Congress.Our rulingKing said a bill in Congress ""will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns.""That’s not true. The latest bill to ban ""assault weapons"" would block the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with one or more military-style features. Guns that already have those features would be grandfathered in.Gun owners would not be required to give up any of their guns as long as they were legally purchased before the ban.We rate his statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Is the United States third in murders and are outlier cities to blame? No.,"A viral meme shared on social media following the Parkland, Fla., shooting claimed the United States has the third-highest count of murders worldwide, a ranking that would drop dramatically if five major cities were excluded.We decided to take a closer look. Is the United States third in murders, and are a few outlier cities responsible? That’s false by any standard.Our count of the UN’s data placed the United States ninth in intentional homicides. We used the most up-to-date count for each country and territory, which included data anywhere from 2007 to 2015.As the country with the third-highest population size, however, experts told us the number of people killed is not a very useful metric.Controlling for population size, most criminologists use the per 100,000 metric. By that standard, we found the United States ranked 94th.When we counted only the countries for which the UN had 2015 data, the United States ranked 73rd. That’s still far from the top ten.The meme argues that a few outlier cities with stringent gun control legislation are responsible for the United States’ high homicide count. But that’s not true, either.Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans have homicide rates well above the national average, but that’s typical for large urban cities.While Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans are consistently among the top five American cities by homicide rate, the cities with most per-capita murders vary from year to year. Neither Washington, D.C., nor Chicago make the top five.Chicago has a high number of homicides because of its population, but its homicide rate is middle of the road for large U.S. cities, according to Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida.Specific reasons for the cities’ high murder rates largely remain a mystery for criminologists, but all are cities with ""high poverty levels, inequality, significant segregation, and an entrenched drug trade,"" Corzine said.Dropping them from the U.S. total has little substantive impact on the U.S. homicide rate or count.The cities cited in the meme accounted for 1,568 of 17,250, or 9.1 percent, of all homicides reported to the FBI in 2016, Tom Kovandzic, a criminologist at the University of Texas, Dallas, calculated for us. And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93.When we applied those reductions to the UN data, the United States barely budged in its international standing. It moved down four spots in per capita murders and stayed the same in total murders. That’s inconsequential compared with the 186-spot jump the meme concocted.Gun control laws are mostly controlled by state legislatures. Washington, D.C., is the only listed city able to enact strict ordinances, while Chicago can do some things, according to Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.""The other lie in this claim is that all five of the named cities have stringent gun regulation. Louisiana, Michigan and Missouri would be very surprised to hear that!"" said Philip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University.The image said, ""The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world.""By no measure is the United States third in total homicides or homicide rates. Excluding the named cities from the count had little to no impact on the United States’ international standing.Three of the cities named in the meme are consistently the top cities for intentional homicides in the United States, but the other two are not. They are by no means outliers, either.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,David Hogg not at school during shooting? Bloggers spread misinformation,"Some bloggers took the 14-second soundbite to insinuate that Hogg wasn’t actually at school when the shooting took place.None of those claims are true.The blogs juxtaposed that statement with the following statement from Hogg in the CBS documentary: ""On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.""People questioned how Hogg could be at school when the shooting started and also be riding his bike three miles to get his camera. And if Hogg really did leave school; how did he get back on to campus if the area was on lockdown?The timeline presented in this way is a bit confusing, but the blogs didn’t try to fairly settle the seeming discrepancy.Here’s what happened.Hogg was at the school during the shooting. Hogg shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet.Sometime after that, he went home.""The evening after the shooting, Hogg says, he biked up to the school, where the media was still camped out,"" the article says. ""This time, he put himself in front of the camera, making his first — but not final — plea for an end to mass shootings.""Sometime after the original stories, both websites issued ""updates"" on their stories to say that the CBS video included Hogg’s quote without context.But not every site did.""It appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context,"" wrote conservative Florida writer  Sarah Rumpf, author of the errant RedState story.

PANTS-FIRE,NRA says violent radicals are behind the March For Our Lives ,"As the National Rifle Association sees it, the March For Our Lives taking place in Washington and in cities and communities nationwide, is a ploy to destroy the Second Amendment. On NRATV, host Grant Stinchfield said he is ""committed to exposing the violent, even deadly history of these people behind this weekend’s March For Our Lives, anti-gun fraud of a protest.""The key evidence behind that claim?Stinchfield argued that the Women’s March, the massive protest the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, is ""a major force behind"" the March For Our Lives.He further argued that the Women’s March organization is run by radicals with violent tendencies. Stinchfield’s first example: Singer Madonna telling a crowd that she felt so frustrated after the election that she ""thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House."" (""But I know that this won't change anything,"" she quickly added.)We explored the facts behind each link in that chain of association. The organization behind the March For Our Lives defies easy description, but one thing is clear: As an organization, the Women’s March is not a big player.The NRA broadcast mentioned Tamika Mallory, a Women’s March national co-chair.""She has nothing to do with this,"" said Allan Mayer, co-CEO of 42West, the public relations firm for March For Our Lives.The NRA listed another Women’s March co-chair, Linda Sarsour.""Absolutely no connection to what we’re doing,"" Mayer said.Katz applied as an individual for the permits to march in Washington. She is the president of the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit established to fund the march and future lobbying on gun control.Everytown for Gun Safety receives significant support from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Giffords Courage to Fight emerged after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and is the project of gun victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband Mark Kelly.March For Our Lives has had no trouble securing hefty donations from Hollywood stars, companies and philanthropists.The NRA said that the March For Our Lives is ""backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions."" That allegation rested on the idea that the Women’s March played a major role in the march, and the NRA host mentioned two co-chairs by name.We found no evidence that either the organization or those people are directly involved in the march. The Women’s March website doesn’t even list the gun control march as an upcoming event.The only significant tie between the marches is a producer who leads the Los Angeles chapter of the Women’s March. But the chapter said it is not involved, and the producer has acted on her own to apply for permits and establish the March For Our Lives’ nonprofit support fund.Major organizational muscle behind the march, both in Washington and in cities nationwide, comes from two well-known gun control advocacy groups, neither of which has a history of violent behavior. A number of related organizations have lent their support, including the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and celebrity donors have given millions of dollars.The NRA claim is without merit. We rate it Pants on Fire.We also updated the story to reflect Madonna's full quote from the 2017 Women's March."

The Squawker article characterizes Flores’ quote as follows:""Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty.

MCM’s vice president, manager of general construction and its Texas operations director are all men. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman.Furthermore, Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM, who has figured into the conspiracy theory as something of a scapegoat, had no involvement in FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge, according to her alma mater FIU.We rate this Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Rauner’s head-spinning claim that arch conservative opponent Jeanne Ives is a Mike Madigan lackey,"As governor, Republican Bruce Rauner has waged a ceaseless battle with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. But in seeking re-election, Rauner also is fighting off a primary challenge from state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton, one of the most conservative Republicans in the House.The deep-pocketed Rauner is now seeking to combine his two political enemies into one by portraying Ives as a Madigan stooge in TV ads. One ad intersperses clips of Ives speaking about Madigan with an announcer leveling damning accusations.""Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor?"" the announcer asks ominously. ""Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey. Jeanne Ives, she can’t serve you because she already serves him.""Hyperbole and exaggeration are commonplace in political ads, but this one struck us as not just over the top but ridiculous. Ives is the ideological opposite of Madigan and his Democrats.How then could she be doing his bidding, as Rauner’s campaign asserts? We decided to take a closer look.In an email, Giorgio described Local 150 as a ""Madigan-aligned labor group.""But Marc Poulos, executive director of the PAC, said it has donated to Democrats and Republicans alike who support road building and other construction projects. Ives, he noted, backed a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2016 that barred state officials from diverting transportation related tax revenue for other purposes. The group contributed most of its money to Ives before she announced her run for governor.Since 2010, the union PAC has given $13.9 million to Democrats and Republicans, state records show. Four political committees controlled by Madigan, including the Democratic Party of Illinois, have received more than $1 million from the labor group. But Republican legislative leaders, as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers like Ives, also received money.State records show that since 2010, the Local 150 PAC has showered $45,000 in campaign cash on current state Senate Republican leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who is backing Rauner in the primary. Brady recorded receiving $5,000 of that as recently as March 1 at a time the Rauner attack ad on Ives was already airing.Another $32,000 in Local 150-connected donations have also been directed to Senate Republican caucus whip Karen McConnaughay of St. Charles.Meanwhile, House Republican leader Jim Durkin has been the recipient of $170,500 in Local 150 PAC donations since 2010, though the money flow has stopped in the current election cycle when the union broke with Durkin and began actively trying to defeat him.Rauner, however, has received no donations from the Local 150 PAC, records show.It’s interesting to note that Rauner’s campaign hangs its argument about Ives and Madigan on a tiny sliver of her political financing while making no mention of her main source of funding, Lake Forest businessman Richard Uihlein.Uihlein is the wealthy owner of a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company and a major donor to an array of causes and candidates attractive to the far right of the Republican Party, including the failed Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.Records show Uihlein has donated $2.5 million to the Ives campaign for governor, about 70 percent of all money she’s raised since announcing her candidacy in December.Four years ago, Uihlein donated $2.6 million to Rauner for his initial run for governor.Also included in the Rauner campaign ad are video snippets of comments Ives made during a debate with Rauner earlier this year before the Chicago Tribune editorial board.At one point, she can be heard chastising Rauner for ""picking on Mike Madigan again."" At another point, Ives reacts to a Rauner comment about Madigan by saying, ""I don’t think that’s any way to deal with the powerful speaker of the house, Mike Madigan.""The context of her comments was far different from what the cherry-picked segments used in the Rauner campaign ad make them appear. The full video of the debate makes it clear Ives was not defending Madigan but rather criticizing Rauner for what she claimed was his ineffectiveness in working with and negotiating with the Democratic majority in the Legislature.Rauner’s campaign ad said: ""Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor? Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey.""A political committee that has supported Michael Madigan and a number of other politicians of both parties gave money to Jeanne Ives. And records show the contributions to Ives total $6,900, a far cry from the $2.5 million she has received from a conservative businessman who once was a major donor to Rauner.Ives was once a loyal supporter of Rauner in the Illinois House, but broke with the governor last year because she claimed he had become too liberal on social issues. Central to her complaint was Rauner’s signing of abortion rights and immigrant rights legislation that Ives opposed and Madigan backed.That is hardly a portrait of a Madigan lackey. Indeed, it is the opposite.Rauner campaign claims about Ives and Madigan turn credibility and rational argument inside out. That is why we give them our lowest possible credibility rating, Pants On Fire!"

""We’re going to reform a broken immigration system. And make no mistake about it, we’re going to build that wall,"" Pence said to applause.We sought to verify Pence’s declaration that seven suspected or known terrorists are daily getting nabbed at the border.A suspected terrorist, the FBI says, is an individual reasonably suspected to have engaged in or currently or about to be engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities.Total apprehensions in border regionNo data for terrorists apprehended at borderBy email, Nowrestah told us he was unaware of statistics supporting Pence’s seven-a-day statement about the U.S.-Mexico border.An alternate claimAnother expert helped us identify a seven-a-day claim that has factual footing.The 2018 report says: ""Where consistent with the law, such individuals are denied entry into the United States, while in some cases law enforcement authorities are notified and can take appropriate action."" The report further says: ""This data only includes individuals of which the United States encountered and not all of those who may have entered or attempted to enter the country undetected.""Most stopped at airports?In Dallas, Pence said the seven daily apprehensions were taking place along the southern border.

It’s a vast architecture that includes many names for varying levels of concern. Denying entry is a low bar to clear. Which is part of the reason citing this number to defend the immigration-centric counterterrorism strategy is misleading.

The argument was unrelated to guns.After Hogg’s friend put a boogie board on a trash can on the beach, a lifeguard asked him to remove it. The friend complied with the lifeguard's request, but the interaction turned sour after the friend made a snide remark.Hogg’s video of the dispute went viral.

The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past.In general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as ""off,"" ""weird"" and ""crazy"" to describe him to journalists.We emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff’s Office to ask some questions about Cruz’s Instagram account but not did get a reply.When asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: ""Because he is an evil killer.""The Geller Report described Cruz as being ""immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate."" Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.The Patriot Report said that after Trump learned that Obama ordered the U.S. Education Department to divert more than $8 million to build the library, Trump rescinded the money and diverted it to privately held charter schools. Michelle Obama was going to get a private residence on the top floor, but Trump supposedly cancelled that, too.""Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, he’ll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bush’s guest home,"" the story said.The library is then transferred to the federal government and operated and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency, through its congressionally appropriated operating budget. Some staff and programs at the libraries are paid for with funds from associated private foundations organized to fund the construction of the library.In May 2017, the Obama Foundation and the records agency announced that the arrangement for Obama’s library would be different from existing presidential libraries.University of Louisville Professor Benjamin Hufbauer, an expert on presidential libraries, said the Obama library gains a couple of benefits by opting out of the typical presidential library system. First, the library won’t have to raise the congressionally-mandated 60 percent of the cost of construction endowment for future maintenance. Also, the library won’t have to build an archival facility for documents, films, video, electronic records.We found no evidence that Trump had rescinded any such funding for the library. In reality, the Obama Foundation will raise money for the center in Chicago.We rate this headline Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, majority of states did not ban Sharia law","A story appearing on Facebook repeated talk of Donald Trump’s 2015 proposed ban on Muslim immigrants but went too far in including a claim that the majority of U.S. states have banned Sharia law.Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, and financial dealings.Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.

Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,"" he said.The story on viralusa.org didn’t explain the setting when Trump made that quote: he said it at a rally in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on Dec. 7, 2015 pointing to a statement he made earlier that day.(Graham and Carson were among Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary at the time.)These state laws generally ban the application of foreign laws if it violates a person’s fundamental rights such as freedom of religion or speech.Though most of the laws don’t expressly ban Sharia law, critics say that they could be viewed as anti-Muslim.A headline said that ""45 states just banned Sharia law,"" but the story itself contained no information about any such state bans. While there have been some states that have enacted legislation to ban the use of foreign law, at least in some circumstances, it’s a gross exaggeration to say that the majority of states have banned Sharia law.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about 'treason',"""You’re up there, you’ve got half the room going totally crazy, wild — they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country,"" Trump said on Feb. 5. ""And you have the other side, even on positive news — really positive news, like that — they were like death and un-American.  Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.""There’s actually a very good reason why not: The Constitution.""It was a profoundly stupid and ignorant statement,"" said Carlton F.W. Larson, a law professor at the the University of California-Davis who is writing a book about treason and the American Revolution. ""There are occasional hard cases where it is debatable whether something constitutes treason. But this is not one of them.""Second, the Constitution is very clear when it comes to the definition of treason.""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.""The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.""This is a narrow definition. On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government.With the possible exception of an American ""levying war"" against U.S. troops in a place like Afghanistan, ""the biggest-picture takeaway is that there is no treason occurring on any side now,"" said Jed Shugerman, a legal historian at Fordham Law School.""We are not at war with Russia under any fair understanding of the word,"" he said. Shugerman added that even a notion like ""cyberwar"" with Russia is a metaphor for war rather than an actual deadly conflict, unless that cyberwar were to escalate to, say, hacking into nuclear power plants with the intent of exploding them.Calling U.S.-Russia relations ""war"" is no more accurate than calling the Super Bowl ""war"" just because the players talk about battle plans and how to attack their enemy, he said.A rendering of the Whiskey Rebellion. (Wikimedia commons)Charges of treason have been prosecuted in relation to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; against Aaron Burr (who was acquitted); Thomas W. Dorr, who set up a parallel government of Rhode Island in the 1840s (he was convicted but later pardoned); and a number of cases related to slavery and the Civil War.There was a flurry of treason cases during and after World War II, including the poet Ezra Pound for pro-Axis propaganda (he was hospitalized for insanity) and the broadcast propagandists known as Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally (both of whom served prison time).The rarity of treason charges can also be seen in the examples of actions that never drew a treason charge.When Eugene V. Debs was prosecuted for encouraging draft avoidance during World War I, he was charged with sedition, not treason. During the Cold War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of espionage charges, not treason. (Espionage does not have to occur during wartime, or even against an enemy.) And Jane Fonda was never charged with treason for allegations of anti-Americanism when she consorted with the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.Legal scholars we contacted unanimously said Trump’s words were ill-conceived.""It’s not only legally frivolous and offensive to suggest that an act of political protest as simple as not clapping isn’t treason, but it’s wholly ignorant of why the Constitution has a treason clause in the first place — to prevent what was a common practice in England at the time, in which the government labeled its political opponents as ‘traitors’ and used that as an excuse to throw them in jail,"" said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.""Being rude and partisan does not come close to the constitutional definition of treason,"" agreed Robert F. Turner, a fellow at the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia.Michael C.H. McDaniel, the director of Homeland Security Law Programs at Western Michigan University, said there could hardly be a clearer example of protected political speech than the one Trump decided to label treasonous.""Expressing partisan disagreement with the president is not treason -- in fact, it is political speech, the core speech to which the First Amendment is protecting from the Federal government,"" he said.Trump said that at the State of the Union address, Democrats, ""even on positive news … were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?""There’s a good reason why not: Declining to applaud the president doesn’t come anywhere near meeting the constitutionally defined threshold of treason, which in any case can’t occur except in wartime. Rather, legal experts agree that it is a clear case of constitutionally protected free speech. We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Would a border wall have prevented the opioid epidemic?,"In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, President Donald Trump proposed a stricter immigration system that he says would keep Americans safer and help address the country’s opioid epidemic.Trump’s plan is built on four ""pillars,"" as he called them, one of which is a wall along America’s southern border.""Our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country,"" Trump said, adding shortly thereafter: ""These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.""While Trump’s speech didn’t linger on the relationship between opioids and Mexico, Coulter attempted to provide some context.""Good he's talking about opioid crisis -- 100% of heroin/fentanyl epidemic is because we don't have a WALL,"" she tweeted.There are three claims to address here. One: the insinuation that the opioid crisis is limited to or caused by a rise in heroin and fentanyl use. Two: that all heroin and fentanyl used by Americans enters the country through Mexico. And three: the suggestion that building a wall along America’s southern border would drastically reduce opioid abuse.What are opioids?What caused the epidemic?The commission included former Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the chairman, Republican Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Democratic North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, former Democratic Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Bertha Madras, an opioid expert and professor of psychobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.In 2015 alone, the Institute says, an estimated 2 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 591,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder (the stats aren’t mutually exclusive).Where do heroin and fentanyl come from?""Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico, believed to be the primary source of heroin for the U.S. market, have continued to surge, providing traffickers a steady stream of high-purity, low-cost heroin to market throughout the United States,"" the report says.Trump’s opioid commission says many users are ordering the pill-form of fentanyl online and having it shipped discreetly. The commission’s report references a Carnegie Mellon University study which found that revenues from online illicit drug sales increased from between $15-17 million in 2012 to $150-$180 million in 2015.Furthermore, the fentanyl found at the southern border tends to be less potent than the fentanyl shipped through the mail.Would a wall work?Probably not.The report notes that the most common method employed by Mexican traffickers ""involves transporting illicit drugs through U.S. ports of entry (POEs) in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers.""As for fentanyl, Trump’s opioid commission seemed more concerned with shipments from China than couriers from Mexico.""We are losing this fight predominately through China,"" the commission wrote in its interim report.""This must become a top tier diplomatic issue with the Chinese; American lives are at stake and it threatens our national security,"" it says. ""Our inability to reliably detect fentanyl at our land borders and at our international mail handling facilities creates untenable vulnerabilities.""Josh Stein, North Carolina’s Democratic attorney general, summarized the issue in an email.""Traffickers predominately bring heroin from Mexico but usually through legal points of entry. Drug dealers import illicit fentanyl from China usually by air. To effectively combat the opioid epidemic … there are better investments than a wall.""Our rulingCoulter, alluding to the opioid crisis, said the heroin and fentanyl epidemic was ""100 percent"" caused by America’s lack of a border wall. Heroin is mostly trafficked from Mexico, mostly hidden in cargo – not by crossing the border through the desert. Fentanyl comes from both Mexico and Canada, and can also be transported through the mail. Coulter’s ""100 percent"" claim is far off-base no matter how we parse it.

He called the story ""ridiculous,"" ""bogus"" and ""fake.""The story said that Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis to promote the 2018 Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when he went off script and claimed that the NFL rigged the game to earn maximum revenue for league.""According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system,"" the article said.The video focused on a referee who congratulated the team’s quarterback Tom Brady after the Patriots beat the Jaguars.NFL spokesman McCarthy told PolitiFact, ""It's not uncommon for an official to congratulate a player after a game.""The ad featured photos of the Patriots and Vikings quarterbacks and said, ""When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the Patriots vs. the Vikings battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title!""The NFL apologized for the ads.McCarthy also told PolitiFact the ad was a mistake.But in this case, the claim that an ""NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged’, found dead"" is fake news.We rate this story Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Rauner’s dubious balanced budget claims … again,"The Illinois Constitution requires Gov. Bruce Rauner to draw up a budget plan each year that is balanced. But a wide range of fiscal experts agree he didn’t do it in 2015 after taking office. He didn’t do it in 2016. He didn’t do it last year either, even though he claimed otherwise.Indeed, the budget Rauner proposed last year was so clearly billions of dollars out of whack that, when he presented it to the General Assembly last March, PolitiFact Illinois handed the governor the lowest possible Pants on Fire! credibility rating for contending it was in balance.So we were puzzled when Rauner on Monday declared to the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: ""I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor.""Rauner followed that on Wednesday during his annual State of the State speech to lawmakers in Springfield with a declaration that unintentionally drew a boisterous round of sarcastic cackling from Democrats in the chamber.""I will submit a balanced budget proposal next month,"" Rauner said, pausing a couple of beats before adding, ""Again.""Rauner’s budget proposal for the next fiscal year is still under wraps, so it’s too early to judge whether available revenue will align with expenditures as required by law. But his persistence in arguing that his past budgets were all balanced, despite broad and convincing evidence to the contrary, inspired us to take another look.""Year after year, Governor Rauner has introduced balanced budgets, along with the reforms needed to save taxpayer dollars and put Illinois back on a firm fiscal footing and, year after year, he has been met with resistance from those more comfortable with the status quo. The Governor will continue to push for balanced budgets, pension reform, cutting regulatory red tape, reforms to make our jobs climate competitive, and spending reductions so that Illinois can grow again.""In short, Rauner’s office avoided a direct answer to the question we posed. The statement does, however, further a factually challenged narrative that the governor often repeats.There’s history here. Critics say Rauner’s balanced budget boast which earned him a Pants on Fire! in 2017 was no anomaly.""He has never introduced a balanced budget,"" said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. ""What he has put out there doesn’t even rise to smoke and mirrors.""Martire said the same air of unreality applies to Rauner’s latest statements on the budget. ""Maybe in a place where they have unicorns?"" Martire said.Last year, in panning Rauner’s claim about his 2017 budget, PolitiFact pointed to some stark numbers that didn’t add up. ""Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance,"" PolitiFact wrote then.Much of that might have been dismissed as the product of partisan sniping, except for one suspect entry in Rauner’s budget in which he penciled in $4.57 billion in savings for what was described in vague terms as ""working together on a grand bargain.""The ""bargain"" in question depended on lawmakers hammering out a broad compromise on a range of spending and ancillary issues including contentious topics like workers’ compensation and tax reform. Rauner ultimately sank the package by withholding support even though he factored its approval into his budget calculations.While the ""grand bargain"" itself never materialized, attempts at reaching it evolved into a bipartisan effort in the Legislature to break an historic budget stalemate that lasted a total of two years. Last summer, a handful of Republicans crossed the aisle to help override Rauner’s veto of a spending plan authored by Democrats.After PolitiFact bestowed a Pants on Fire! on Rauner’s earlier budget claim, new information came to light that only served to underscore the rating.In the budget blueprint he proposed last year, Rauner called for creation of a 401(k) style savings plan for newly hired public school teachers and public workers. He estimated that would slice $500 million in savings off the state’s pension costs for fiscal 2018, which began last July 1.Despite the budgetary feuding, the Democratic budget included the 401(k) plan Rauner had asked for.Ironically, Rauner in vetoing the Democrats’ budget faulted them for counting on the same $500 million in savings that he had included in his own spending plan months earlier.Head spinners like that have provided ample fodder for those in Springfield who question Rauner’s credibility when it comes to budget matters.""We just heard Governor Rauner's re-election speech. Now he has 14 days to deliver a balanced budget that doesn’t involve pixie dust and magic beans.""Rauner last year earned PolitiFact’s Pants on Fire! rating for his claim that a state budget he proposed was balanced. Indeed, fiscal experts say Rauner has never proposed a balanced budget as required under the state Constitution since taking office in 2015.All facts to the contrary, Rauner repeated a similar claim this week during an appearance at the Chicago Tribune. ""I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor,"" Rauner said.Aides to the governor filibustered when we asked them to back up his latest statement.A year ago, PolitiFact called Rauner out on his balanced budget claim. His most recent comment is equally outrageous. Once again, we rate it Pants on Fire!"

They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.""But then when Trump spoke to the girls’ parents, the chamber sounded silent.Speaking to the girls’ parents, Trump said: ""Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand,"" he said, as the parents then stood. ""Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump gets polar ice trend backwards,"President Donald Trump, who once called climate change a hoax spread by China, downplayed concerns about global temperature trends in an interview with Piers Morgan.Morgan asked Trump if he believed that climate change exists.We looked at what’s been going on with the polar ice.Trump is wrong that the ice caps are at record levels.Researcher Julienne Stroeve with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said Trump’s claim was ""odd.""Stroeve said polar ice is at ""a record low in the Arctic (around the North Pole) right now and near record low in the Antarctic (around the South Pole).""In no way are the ice caps at record highs.Physicist Kent Moore at the University of Toronto said the satellite record going back to 1979 is well validated and reliable. For the Arctic ice certainly, but also broadly for the Antarctic too, Moore said ""there is variability from year to year but the long-term trend is downwards.""Moore did note though that some climate models are predicting a slower rate of loss than scientists have seen in the past.But a full reading of the report showed that the gains were slowing down and researchers said that in 20 to 30 years, losses would outstrip gains.We note that the study is not directly comparable to other data because it measures the ice in tons, while historically, researchers have tracked how far the ice is spread out, that is, its area, not its weight. Moore and Stroeve said the area measurements are more reliable because the observational data has been gathered over many decades. More accurate volume measurements have only recently come on line.Moore said recent work at the University of Washington suggests that even in terms of volume, the amount of polar ice has been falling.Trump said that the ice caps are at record levels. They are not. The numbers show that the extent of the ice at both poles is smaller than it was decades ago. The shrinkage is more striking in the Arctic, but the overall trend is downward at both ends of the earth.By no means are the ice caps at record high levels.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

There is no excuse for endangering our communities by allowing criminal aliens who have committed a crime to go free.""Patrick points to state-posted figuresA spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, replied by email: ""We have answered this question many times.""      Adding up the chart’s tallied arrests, covering 11 crime categories, gets you to 638,411 arrests ""associated with criminal aliens.""And did all those arrests occur in the six-plus years noted by Patrick on Facebook?Not so.More from the DPS page about those ""career"" arrests: ""Those arrests include 1,300 homicide charges; 76,044 assault charges; 18,126 burglary charges; 76,660 drug charges; 774 kidnapping charges; 43,591 theft charges; 49,154 obstructing police charges; 4,180 robbery charges; 6,878 sexual assault charges; and 9,561 weapon charges.""Unmentioned in that text: 352,143 of all the tallied arrests, 55 percent, were for ""all other offenses,"" according to the DPS.According to DPS criminal history records, the agency says, those 638,000-plus criminal charges ""have thus far resulted in over 286,000 convictions."" The conviction count presented on the chart offered as Patrick’s backup indicates 286,101 convictions.The DPS page says the convictions break out to 547 homicide convictions; 28,592 assault convictions; 8,915 burglary convictions; 37,581 drug convictions; 268 kidnapping convictions; 19,803 theft convictions; 24,084 obstructing police convictions; 2,153 robbery convictions; 3,164 sexual assault convictions; and 3,973 weapon convictions."" Its text on the web page doesn’t mention the 157,021 included convictions for other offenses accounting for 55 percent of the total convictions.We spotted a couple other wrinkles.We noticed too that the DPS doesn’t specify how many of the noted arrests or convictions through criminal careers tie to the 160,000-plus people believed to be living here illegally at the time of their latest arrest.Our requests to the DPS to corroborate Patrick’s 566,000 figure didn’t yield additional information.Our rulingPatrick said that ""566,000 crimes"" were ""made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years.""We didn't find a factual path to this figure and, in fact, spotted no state-posted information specifying a relevant count of criminal arrests or convictions for the six-plus years singled out by Patrick.The DPS has said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions were accumulated through their ""criminal careers"" by more than 240,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into Texas jails in the six-plus years. Unsaid: Some of those people were living in the U.S. with legal authorization.We find Patrick’s statement inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, California didn’t pass a law allowing undocumented immigrants to register to vote","It’s intended to bolster registration in a state where voter turnout has lagged.A slew of conservative websites, however, have seized on the law, dubbed the California New Motor Voter Program, to make the claim this week that it will register undocumented immigrants to vote.They cite a separate law, AB 60, that allows undocumented Californians to apply for and obtain a state driver’s license, as alleged proof.This isn’t the first wave of commentary on the topic. Similar statements were made when California passed the Motor Voter program in 2015.But because the claims popped up again this week, it’s time to take another look at the California laws in question and the safeguards state officials say are in place.We’ll also place a rating on the claim by World Net Daily.Background on the lawsIn 2015, Brown signed the New Motor Voter law. By April, it will automatically register DMV customers to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license or fill out change of address forms, unless the customer opts-out.Under the law, the DMV would electronically send information for those eligible to register to vote -- which does not include undocumented residents -- to the California Secretary of State’s Office. That office would, in turn, verify name and citizenship information. A spokesman for that office did not respond to requests for comment this week.In the past, however, Secretary of State Alex Padilla has pledged the new system will be an improvement over the existing one.""Completely inaccurate"" claimsJessica Gonzalez, spokeswoman with the California DMV, said she’s contacted several of the websites making what she called ""completely inaccurate"" claims and asked for corrections. One, the Daily Mail, had pulled down its story, another updated its article, while she said Fox News did not immediately correct its article.""Undocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote at the DMV,"" Gonzalez told PolitiFact California. ""And we have programming measures in place to prevent that from occurring.""At DMV field offices, Gonzalez said, technicians will not be able to key in any voting information for undocumented customers seeking AB 60 license renewals.As soon as a technician types in AB 60, the voter information section automatically gets ""greyed out"" and can’t be typed into and can’t be bypassed, the spokeswoman said. She added that the same safeguards are in place for online and mail renewals.""The (mail) form won’t even have the voter information questions on it, so they won’t be able to register to vote,"" Gonzalez said.""It’s really interesting how quickly false information spreads,"" she continued, ""and how difficult it is to get the correct information out there to Californians that really need to know this information.""A representative for World Net Daily could not be reached for comment.Our rulingConservative news websites and commentators claimed California plans to register undocumented immigrants to vote.In reality, the California law that goes into effect in April 2018 will automatically register only those eligible to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license. Undocumented immigrants are excluded. The law does nothing to change the federal requirement that one must be a U.S. citizen to register to vote.State officials said safeguards are already in place to prevent state DMV workers from typing in any voter information for AB 60 license holders. The state allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain a driver’s license, but explicitly excludes that group from the automatic voter registration.The allegations on this topic are recycled. And they’re still blatantly untrue.We rate World Net Daily’s claim Pants On Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Ted Cruz says he's opposed shutdowns, but he hasn't always","With an end to the federal government shutdown in sight, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to argue that, contrary to popular belief, he was not the driving force behind the previous government shutdown in 2013.Back in 2013, Cruz -- then a junior member of the Senate’s minority party -- had tried to end funding for the Affordable Care Act. He pushed for language to defund Obamacare in spending bills, which would have forced then-President Barack Obama to choose between keeping the government open and crippling his signature legislative achievement.As the high-stakes legislative game played out, Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut the law, and the Republicans, as a minority party, didn’t have the numbers to force their will. Following a 16-day shutdown, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act.Leading up to the 2018 shutdown, Cruz’s role in the 2013 budget impasse received fresh media coverage, since he was now in the Senate majority. Would he be able to reconcile his past tactics with his current urgings not to shut down the government?This echoes the framing Cruz offered Hunt -- namely, that his motivation was not to keep the government from being funded, but rather to defund Obamacare, and that the only reason people believe this is because of the biased media.However, even if, for the sake of argument, you accept Cruz’s line of thinking, his hallway comments offered a very specific definition of determining whether a lawmaker had ""consistently opposed shutdowns.""Specifically, Cruz said that ""only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill."" Cloture refers to a Senate vote to cut off debate and proceed to a bill; it’s a prerequisite for considering a bill, and these days, it typically takes 60 votes.So did Cruz ever ""vote to deny cloture on a funding bill""?He did.By doing the ""one thing"" that he himself said defines causing a shutdown, Cruz didn't ""consistently oppose shutdowns.""Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that his ""goal was to defund Obamacare, not shut down the government, and that is the point he was making today. He voted several times and fought in the face of (Democratic) opposition to fund vital government services -- including the military, veterans benefits, the National Guard, and National Health Institute -- while working to defund Obamacare before it went into effect, at which point he knew it would be markedly more difficult to undo. Sen. Cruz voted against cloture on the final bill because it still funded Obamacare, and he was committed to continuing the debate to defund it, while supporting bills to fund the other functions of government not impacted by Obamacare.""Cruz said, ""I have consistently opposed shutdowns."" Debunking this assertion doesn’t even require leveraging the many Republican statements criticizing Cruz’s legislative tactics for prompting the 2013 government shutdown. It only requires using the standard Cruz laid out in the same interview -- that ""only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill.""Cruz did that very thing in 2013, when he was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture for the spending bill that would go on to end the shutdown. He was also one of 18 senators to vote against the bill itself.We rate his statement Pants on Fire."

You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No. What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people, they put them in a bin, but in his hand, when he’s picking them is, really, the worst of the worst. Congratulations, you’re going to the United States. Okay. What a system — lottery system.""Trump made similar comments on Dec. 20 at a Cabinet meeting: ""When we take people in a lottery, they're not putting their best people in the lottery. It's common sense. They're not saying, 'Oh, let's take our best people and let's put them into the lottery so that we can send them over to the United States.' No. They put their worst people into the lottery. And that's what we get in many cases.""In this case, Trump oversimplified and misconstrued the program. Countries don't send their people. Lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries. Lottery winners are selected by a random, computerized process. Individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa.The White House declined to comment on the record for this fact-check.Trump favors a merit-based immigration system where people come in based on job skills, not just because of family connections or for diversity purposes.It's not foreign governments who run the lottery, it's administered by the U.S. State Department. Here’s its current description of the program:• Applicants register online for the lottery in the fall;• Names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer;• Lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for the diversity visa;• The visa application process and interviews begin Oct. 1. This step includes extensive vetting such as biographic and biometric screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases;""No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies,"" the State Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.""National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,"" the agency added.""In countries where only a fraction of people complete secondary school, this basic criterion limits the pool of people eligible for the diversity lottery significantly,"" said Beth Elise Whitaker, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.Trump said countries are not ""giving us"" their best people. But that's a flawed statement.Countries do not ""give"" immigrants, noted Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University.""Individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including but not limited to the diversity lottery visa. The decision is a difficult one, as is the process of receiving the visa,"" Cohen said. ""The application and vetting process are also complicated, suggesting that only highly capable and well-prepared individuals will succeed.""Cohen said Trump and his administration have promoted two conflicting goals: They have attacked family reunification immigration policies, but also the diversity lottery, ""which does not rely on family reunification and is far more skills-based than the name suggests.""Trump said of the diversity visa lottery program, ""they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin,"" and ""the worst of the worst"" are selected. Trump based his criticism of the lottery program on the fact that the suspect in a New York City terror attack came through the program in 2010.But Trump’s simplistic characterization gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries don't ""give us"" immigrants. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments.Lottery entrants must meet educational and work experience requirements, and winners are chosen at random by a computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean the person will come to the United States. They must be thoroughly vetted before being awarded a visa.We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire."

Much of the damage was centered in Napa and Sonoma counties.Our researchWe started our fact-check by contacting the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, the agency in charge of investigating the cause of the blazes.Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said there have been no arrests, contradicting the claim in the article.""All the major fires that occurred in October are still being investigated. No arrests have been made in reference to the October siege,"" McLean wrote.We reached out to USA In Front for comment but did not hear back.The website lists its owner as USA In Front Inc., though we were unable to find out where it is based. The site appears to allow users to create an account and submit content. It includes articles on news and politics with a right-wing bent with headlines such as ""Poll: Should Barack Obama Lose His Presidential Pension?"" to ""Meet The Most Liberal, Fiscally Irresponsible, and Pro-Death Republican in Texas.""Article’s originBut what started on the satirical site didn’t stay there.The story circulated around the web, and was posted word-for-word on sites such as World Today 365 and USA In Front. Those websites presented the story as news without any mention of its satirical origin.When we first examined the article, we noticed a few red flags: It does not have a byline, so there’s no direct way to contact the person that wrote the story. Unlike traditional, credible news articles, the story does not have a date or dateline.  Additionally, the article fails to cite any specific people as sources.""This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one.""Breitbart’s false claimIn reality, an undocumented man had been arrested for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials called out Breitbart for fueling the false rumors. State fire authorities said they had not identified an arson suspect nor determined whether arson was the cause of the fires.After fact-checkers pointed out the false claim, Breitbart added an ""update"" saying the man was not suspected of starting the deadly fires.Our rulingA story recently posted on the website USA In Front claimed a Muslim man had been arrested for starting the deadly Northern California wildfires.The website and others presented the claim as if it were news, though it originated as a false tale on a satirical website.A spokesman for the state’s fire agency, Cal Fire, told us there had been no arrests and that the cause of the fires remains under investigation.The article on USA In Front is another example of the many fabricated claims tied to the deadly blazes. It lacks a byline, any specific sources and any disclaimer about its origin as satire. We didn’t hear back from the website.Posting the story without this key warning is reckless and perpetuates false and damaging information.We rate the claim in the USA In Front article Pants On Fire. If the fact-checkers find the story to be ""false,"" a warning label is attached to the original post in Facebook’s news feed, and Facebook’s algorithm makes it more difficult for the disputed post to spread virally."

Schroeder, a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur, told PolitiFact that the company’s last shipment of Tripedia occurred in 2012.""Tripedia is not in use today,"" she said.Tripedia was originally licensed by the FDA in the early 1990s, FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney told PolitiFact. The drug maker had to follow what was at the time broad label requirements for adverse events. More recent federal regulations about drug labeling approved in 2006 are now more narrow and state that the only adverse events that have to be reported are those ""for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.""The scientific evidence does not support a link between any vaccine, including Tripedia (DTaP), and autism or other developmental disorders, McSeveney said.Truthcommand.com stated ""Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism.""But the FDA did no such thing.

Jones made much of a court ruling that allowed digital copies of paper ballots to be erased.""Notice the Democrat judge said, ‘Oh, we’re going to erase all the computer files after tonight, on Wednesday morning,’ "" Jones said. ""So there’s going to be no recount.""Jones is wrong on his facts.The digital files he’s talking about might help spot problems in vote tallies, but they aren’t necessary for a recount.The reason is simple. Across the entire state of Alabama, voters vote on paper ballots. Those ballots are scanned and tallied, which creates the digital images Jones was talking about. But he overlooked that the original paper ballots are preserved.Alabama law is very specific on this point.So without a shadow of a doubt, a recount in Alabama could be done.We emailed Jones through the Infowars website and did not hear back.Jones said that a recount in the Alabama Senate election was not possible because a Democrat judge allowed the state to erase computer files.The one tidbit Jones got right is that a court ruling cleared the way for erasing digital images of ballots. In every other respect, he was wrong.It wasn’t one Democratic judge, but nine Republican ones that issued the ruling.A recount not only is possible without the image files, state law requires that a recount use the original paper ballots, which are kept in sealed containers for nearly two years.Jones took a bare scrap of data and turned it into the stuff of conspiracy.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

Sanders’ post also said ""99.8 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel under Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax.""So, Sanders was clearly referring to only one tax reform provision: repeal of the estate tax.But Roys’ tweet was making a general reference to Trump’s tax plan -- with no indication that the numbers referred only to the estate tax.And its bottom-line claim was that ""under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans"" get ""not one nickel"" in tax cuts.Roys told us she now realizes that what she posted did not make it clear she was referring only to the estate tax. Indeed, a reader could only assume her claim was about the tax plan generally, with the ""#TaxBill"" reference she used and the ""Trump’s new tax plan"" in the headline.But the tax cuts would be widespread: Both plans would lower individual income tax rates for the middle class, and most people in lower-income households would see cuts, as well.Our ratingRoys said that ""under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans"" get ""not one nickel"" in tax cuts.Roys said she was referring to the Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, which would only benefit the wealthiest and does not apply to 99.8 percent of Americans.But her tweet made no reference to the estate tax.

PANTS-FIRE,Convicted mining CEO and GOP candidate says  official papers reveal 'Obama's deadliest cover-up',"Don Blankenship, the convicted executive in one of the country’s deadliest mining explosions, is running for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia, and his first television ad aims to clear his name.""Obama’s deadliest cover-up has been uncovered by MSHA’s own documents,"" the ad said. ""Documents which say the MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) Upper Big Branch internal report was fixed.""Blankenship, running as a Republican, spent a year in jail for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found that under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010.He has always insisted that the fault lies with federal mining regulators who forced the company, he said, to use a defective ventilation system.No investigation, and there have been several, has reached that conclusion.Multiple inquiries found that Massey Energy knew there was risk that methane gas could build up in an active mining location in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W. Va. The company had also been warned that it needed to do more to reduce the levels of combustible coal dust there. The company maintained two sets of records of conditions in the mine. The one it shared with government inspectors listed fewer problems than the one it kept for internal purposes. In one tragic moment, dull blades used to cut free coal created enough heat to ignite gas and coal dust. The explosion that followed killed 29 people.But Blankenship’s ad presents a series of statements to suggest foul play by the government. After saying an internal report was fixed, the ad shows an image of an internal MHSA document that says ""MSHA was responsible for a defective ventilation plan at UBB.""The ad goes on to say ""documents were shredded,"" and that ""government corruption is pandemic.""If, as the ad says, the government’s own documents prove that the internal review was ""fixed,"" then those documents ought to be available.""At this juncture, we’re not going to release the emails,"" Thomas said.When we asked why the campaign wouldn’t release the emails, Thomas at first said he didn’t know, but later explained that ""we want everybody (in the government) to come out and stick to their story.""Thomas said the emails might be shared at some point, and when they were, they would show how the government covered up its role in the mine disaster.We plugged the key quotes into the Nexis database of news reports. Again, nothing.Davitt McAteer, former head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, led the special investigation team created by West Virginia’s governor. McAteer told us that Blankenship is ""incorrect.""""I would have known whether the agency report was fixed,"" McAteer said. ""It was not.""The agency report criticized agency staff, saying they ""did not follow established Agency policies and procedures."" Inspectors failed to spot deficiencies in some of the mine operations and didn’t look closely enough at company records of problems that had gone uncorrected.McAteer’s group took a harder line on the Mine Safety and Health Administration.""Despite MSHA’s considerable authority and resources, its collective knowledge and experience, the disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine is proof positive that the agency failed its duty as the watchdog for coal miners,"" the report said.Another review by the U.S. Labor Department, which oversees the mine safety agency, echoed that, saying ""if MSHA had engaged in timely enforcement of the Mine Act and applicable standards and regulations, it would have lessened the chances of -- and possibly could have prevented -- the UBB explosion.""None of this points to a whitewash of the government regulator’s contributing role in the accident. However, every investigation put Massey Energy at the center of the conditions that produced the disaster.Blankenship produced an ad that said the Obama administration’s internal review of the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s role in a deadly mine explosion was ""fixed."" The ad said the government’s own documents revealed ""Obama’s deadliest cover-up.""Blankenship’s spokesman claimed to have emails that proved the point, but said the campaign would not share them.An extensive review of multiple government reports, plus a search through a database of thousands of news articles produced no supporting facts.The head of an independent investigation said he had come across nothing that pointed to a fix. In fact, his group’s report along with one other sharply criticized government regulators for failing to crack down on the abuses of Blankenship’s company.There is no substance to this claim and the campaign did not provide anything that would back it up.

The email said Putin received a five minute standing ovation at the end of his speech.Here’s what the email claimed was the text of Putin’s speech:""In Russia, (we) live like Russians.  Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, it should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws.  If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims, then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law.Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'.  We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture.  We better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland, and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture, or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims.When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim Minorities are not Russians.’ ...Putin’s actual words were far more moderate, though he did support requiring immigrants to learn Russian.""On the whole, the adaptation of guest workers is a separate and comprehensive issue. We must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society, learn Russian and, of course, respect our culture and traditions and abide by Russian law. In this regard, I believe that the decision to make learning the Russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded,"" said Putin in the speech to the Board of Federal Migration Service.We failed to find any other of Putin’s public remarks that matched up with the chain email. Email chains can be misleading, but this fake speech did not happen, nor did the five-minute standing ovation.

Jarrett and Hannity said it wasn’t hyperbole.We checked with a range of experts in the history of both agencies, and even those who are no fans of past and present FBI practices say the comparison is wrongheaded.Fox News legal analyst Gregg JarrettTo be sure, some of the tactics Jarrett cited are used by the FBI, or more broadly by law enforcement agencies in the United States.A category of subpoena called a ""national security letter"" provides ""a law-enforcement officer with broad discretion or authority to search and seize unspecified places or persons,"" said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org.However, the use of such tools does not make the FBI, or any other U.S. law enforcement agency, the same as a secret police agency such as the old KGB. For one thing, those tactics sometimes may be needed.Here are some of the reasons why any comparison between the two agencies is problematic.Indeed, the very fact that a legal analyst can criticize the FBI on a national television broadcast is a significant departure from anything that would be possible in a country with a true secret police.Put simply, ""the FBI is subject to the laws limiting police powers,"" said Joseph Wippl, a former clandestine Central Intelligence Agency officer who now teaches at Boston University. ""These laws were passed by a Congress elected by the U.S. population. These laws can be changed, either restricting or expanding police powers.""A secret police like the KGB operates ""through the institutionalised use of torture,"" Glees said. By contrast, ""any use of unnecessary violence, let alone torture, would be met with the full force of the criminal law.""Even as bad as the Hoover-era FBI was about civil liberties and abuse of power, Charles said, ""it was still no KGB-like organization coming for people in the dead of night who were then ‘disappeared.’ "" Indeed, he said, the excesses of Hoover’s tenure were, to a large extent, curbed after his death by the ordinary workings of the democratic process.Pike of globalsecurity.org said that, while there’s a need for vigilance, ""there does seem to have been a remarkable absence of abuses of these far-reaching powers.""He added, ""Whatever happens to you down at the J.Edgar Hoover building, you are pretty confident it will not entail a bullet to the back of the head.""A Fox News representative did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Our rulingJarrett said that ""the FBI has become America's secret police … ""The FBI has become America's secret police …  like the old KGB."" He also agreed with Hannity that the statement was not an exaggeration.Numerous historians of the FBI and the KGB say the comparison is ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Fake Russian Twitter account at center of fake tweet about Nancy Pelosi,"A fake Russian troll account suspended months ago is the subject of a fake news headline about House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and a sexual abuse scandal.Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.The article showed an alleged tweet by @TEN_GOP:""I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout. #draintheswamp #Shushfund."" (We assume that ""take"" is a typo and was supposed to say ""talk."")We searched news accounts and found nothing about Pelosi authorizing such a payout. The tweet appears to be the only source of the information.  According to RBC, a Russian media company with a history of independence, @TEN_GOP was a Russian troll account. It had posted 10,000 tweets by the time it was shut down in August 2017, two years after it launched. The fake account had nearly 150,000 followers -- far more than the real state party’s twitter account of about 13,000.The real Tennessee Republican Party contacted Twitter multiple times to report that @TEN_GOP was impersonating the party’s actual account.""It was very misleading, pretending to be our office,"" Tennessee Republican Party communications director Candice Dawkins told PolitiFactTwitter’s press office didn’t respond to an email from PolitiFact.The headline on Puppet String News states, ""Tennessee GOP twitter taken down after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia.""Actually, Twitter took down the fake Russian news account in August, and we found no evidence that Pelosi was involved in a payout related to pedophilia.We rate this headline Pants on Fire."

But Harry never made a statement about it, nor did he say that Trump was a serious threat to human rights. Such a statement would have garnered worldwide headlines. We rate the claim that Harry said Trump was not welcome to the royal wedding as Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrong that no tax cuts passed since Reagan,"""You know, for years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan,"" Trump said on Nov. 29.That’s flat wrong.

Among other things, these bills cut rates for the top bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.The list also includes the extension of many of those tax cuts in advance of their scheduled expiration in 2013 under Obama -- a high-stakes legislative situation known as the ""fiscal cliff."" (The top-bracket rate was one that did not continue; it rose again to 39.6 percent.)Trump's statement is ridiculously wrong -- since 1997, nine major tax bills have passed with tens of billions of dollars in cuts. We rate his statement Pants on Fire."

Tipped off by an assistant of an Imam, police arrived to find the girls dancing with their friends including males. Police arrested the girls.The article then states that the girls were detained for more than a year and that a male-only Sharia panel concluded that they need to be ""executed in accordance with the Sharia law.""A researcher at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle, told PolitiFact that the story is a fabrication.""Gender mixing in Saudi Arabia can lead to criminal penalties but never the death penalty,"" he said.So far in 2017 there have been 133 executions in Saudi Arabia, nearly all for murder or drug smuggling.""In terms of executions of children, unfortunately Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries in the world that continues to sentence child offenders to death, and some have eventually been executed, but I’ve never seen an execution of anyone who is under 18 at the time of the execution,"" he said.In the case of this headline, there is no evidence that these girls were beheaded for being with their male friends.We rate this Pants on Fire."

We searched Nexis and Google and found no evidence that Turner made such a statement.The website dailynewsforamericans.com is largely about famous entertainers reacting to Trump. We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website, which calls itself a ""tested and trustworthy team"" but posts fake news.Turner didn’t mention Trump at all during the interview.Instead, the interview covered topics such as the musical in development about her life, her marriage to Ike Turner and decision to leave him, her career and retirement.The headline stated that Turner was thankful for our president for ""the first time in 8 years,"" a jab against Obama.As for the story that Tina Turner said she is thankful for Trump, we rate this headline Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire 'unsolved mystery' attack on Joe Scarborough,"President Donald Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the firing of NBC’s Matt Lauer over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while encouraging the network to look deeper into its employees.""Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.' But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!,"" Trump tweeted Nov. 29, 2017.In this fact-check, we are focusing on Trump’s attack of Scarborough’s ""unsolved mystery.""Trump is referring to an incident in 2001, when a 28-year-old congressional aide to Scarborough was found dead in one of Scarborough’s district offices.Scarborough represented Florida Panhandle counties as a Republican from 1995 to 2001.A congressional aide in Fort Walton Beach told people she was feeling ill the day before she was found dead, according to a police report.The Fort Walton Beach Police Department report says Lori Klausutis, an aide to Rep. Joe Scarborough, told a co-worker on July 19 that she was not feeling well, but did not elaborate.She made a similar comment to a mail carrier.She was found dead in Scarborough's district office the next morning by two people who came to seek help with an immigration case.Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk. The head injury caused the death, Berkland said.The report, which was released Monday, quotes friends and relatives as saying Klausutis was happily married and was known as ""Little Miss Mary Sunshine.""They said she was under moderate stress in the days before she died. She had two assignments due for college courses. She and her husband had recently moved into a new house, and she was looking for a new job because Scarborough recently resigned from Congress, effective in September.Relatives told police she was upbeat about a job possibility at a local radio station and had recently received a $6,000 raise.Relatives said she had been taking medication for acne and that she suffered a head injury in a traffic accident when she was a teenager that left her in a coma. When she recovered, she had signs of short-term memory loss.A mail carrier who came in the office on July 19 said she appeared nervous. He said Klausutis told him she did not feel well.Scarborough was divorced but had joint custody of his two sons.There’s little more to the conspiracy, but the clarity of the medical examiner’s report did not satisfy people who believe the conspiracy. That list apparently includes Trump.Trump said Scarborough is party to an ""unsolved mystery"" from his time as a congressman in Florida.This case is not unsolved. It is not a mystery.Trump's claim rates Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,No proof that Melania Trump said if ISIS harms her son she will scratch out Obama's eyes,"No, the first lady did not really issue a threat to former President Barack Obama over the safety of her son.In this case, the article is not entirely fictional because it was based on a threat by an ISIS supporter. However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama.Here’s what the group reported:On November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag ""handle the son of the mule of America,"" the supporter, who uses the name ""Dak Al-Munafiqeen,"" Arabic for ""striking the hypocrites,"" wrote: ""Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington."" The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post.""It's the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda,"" he said.The threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact.""The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn’t make it a significant threat,"" he said. ""Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way.""Where the YourNewsWire.com story really goes into fake territory is the idea that Melania Trump responded to the threat by saying ""if ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out."" We could not find any evidence that she responded at all.We contacted YourNewsWire.com and received a reply from the editor in chief, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who said PolitiFact is ""policing the internet as part of a a faux moral crusade on behalf of the Clinton regime.""YourNewsWire.com stated that Melania Trump said, ""If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out.""We found no evidence that Melania Trump responded to an online threat against Barron at all — much less that she said she would enact revenge on Obama.We rate this headline Pants on Fire."

""The letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable,"" stated the article.The article then directed readers to call the White House switchboard if they don’t receive the letter.

We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!""Upon completion of the survey participants get a message: ""Congratulations! You won 2 Free tickets at Southwest Airlines!""But don’t expect those tickets to ever arrive.""A good rule of thumb is that if something sounds too good to be true, it generally is,"" Landson told PolitiFact.Landson pointed to a few signs that this is fake news: the airline’s official website is Southwest.com while this website is sout-west.com.The date written as ""27. November 2017"" is also not a format that Southwest uses.""And, we never just give out free tickets,"" Landson said. Landson said Southwest is in its 47th year, not its 50th. (Landson originally said the airline had celebrated its 48th birthday, which is incorrect.)""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. ....

The story is completely bogus.Just to be sure the assertions in the story were fake, we asked a couple of legal experts whether there was any sort of case like the one described, or if the court had issued any bench warrants.Tom Goldstein, who runs SCOTUSblog.com with his wife Amy Howe, told us that ""every possible aspect of that is fiction.""Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was unaware of any bench warrant ever being issued by the Supreme Court.""Bench warrants are issued to cause the arrest of someone who violated a court rule or showed contempt for the court, so in theory the Supreme Court could indeed issue one.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrongly repeats that Chicago has strongest gun laws,"President Donald Trump might be in Asia, but violence on the homefront followed him to South Korea.In a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a reporter asked Trump if he would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas church.Trump said a longer waiting period would have made no difference and then drew on a familiar talking point.""You look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,"" Trump said.Here’s why.There are two ways to measure the toughness of gun laws. You can look at the rules controlling gun ownership and the penalties for misuse of a weapon.It’s harder and requires more time to do the same in New York. It takes about three to six months to get a permit and costs over $400. And unlike Chicago, New York runs its own concealed carry permit process, as does Los Angeles.Chicago also isn't particularly tough when it comes to enforcement.The group said Illinois could bring up its score if it allowed local governments to pass gun laws, required guns be stored safely at home and gave local law enforcement more leeway to deny conceal carry permits.The one area where Chicago is trying to reduce access to weapons is by not allowing gun stores or firing ranges to open within the city limits. So far, courts have ruled against Chicago.We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.Trump said Chicago has the strongest gun laws in the nation. The statement is years out of date.

A claim shot full of holes,"""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there,"" Sanders said. ""So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact.""Sanders’ statement was nearly identical to that of her boss nearly a year ago.""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city,"" Trump said.Trump, following the rhetoric lead of many other strong gun rights advocates, has over the years frequently pointed to Chicago as ""proof"" that gun ownership restrictions not only fail to reduce crime, but exacerbate it.The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there!Sanders took Trump’s illogical and invalid argument a step further. Now Chicago’s handgun ownership history proves that mass shootings committed with automatic weapons can’t be prevented with legal restrictions.Two years later, however, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Illinois concealed carry ban as unconstitutional and the state soon after became the last in the nation to approve concealed carry.As we noted last year in fact-checking Trump’s Chicago-bashing:But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are.Seven states receive higher grades than Illinois in the latest Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ratings.Sanders, fielding questions about the impact of the Las Vegas massacre, pointed to chronic  gun violence in Chicago as proof that tough gun laws were ineffective. ""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,"" she said. ""That certainly hasn’t helped there,""There was a brief time between 2008 and 2010 -- the window during which Washington, D.C.’s handgun ban had been invalidated but Chicago’s still stood -- where that might have been true. But federal court rulings effectively undid city and state laws severely restricting gun use and ownership in the Chicago. When it comes to the concealed carry of weapons, Chicago has less authority to impose limitations than do many other large U.S. cities.In the thick of 2016 presidential campaign, we rated a nearly identical statement from then candidate Trump as Mostly False. Since then, similar claims have been uttered frequently by others and repeatedly debunked.Sanders therefore has had ample opportunity to learn her boss had been flat wrong when making the same claim on the campaign trail. Her revival of the claim, made in the midst of the debate raging over the Las Vegas massacre, is at best intellectually lazy and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead.There’s no mitigating factor or missing context here. Sanders’ statement earns our lowest credibility rating, Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Fake news posts blame Puerto Rico's truck drivers for refusing to ship relief supplies,"Conservative news outlets have been spreading a false story online that wrongly says aid to Hurricane Maria victims isn’t being distributed in Puerto Rico because union truck drivers have gone on strike.The post claimed that while the ""liberal media"" is attacking President Donald Trump’s response to the humanitarian crisis, the real issue is that ""the Teamsters Union drivers did not show up to work. Only 20 percent of drivers arrived at the ports to distribute the relief supplies,"" The Gateway Pundit said.But they aren’t right to blame union truckers for the lack of movement. It turns out the blog posts are delivering misinformation about this problem.The Conservative Treehouse post included a passage from the interview that said supplies are being sent to Puerto Rico, but not being moved across the island.""It’s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers,"" the website quoted Valle as saying. ""Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20 percent of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.""Valle did say in the Huffington Post interview that there was a lack of drivers, but he also went on to add the drivers deserved ""zero blame:""""They can’t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can’t get fuel themselves, and they can’t call us for help because there’s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family’s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can’t call home.""""You’re looking at truck drivers who can’t be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don’t have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don’t have fuel,"" Brewer said. ""The problem is the supply chain.""She added that Crowley Puerto Rico, a shipping and logistics company, said that getting drivers to the port and back out again was proving to be a challenge.""At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers,"" the release read. ""However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs.""There’s no mention of strike in the press release, and nothing in Valle’s interview about labor unions, so where did the The Conservative Treehouse get that? From an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the Teamsters union.Dozens of subsequent posts online identify Frente Amplio (note the different spelling) as the local Teamsters union, which Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe told us is incorrect. Rodriguez represents the independent Frente Amplio de Camioneros de Puerto Rico (Broad Front of Truck Drivers of Puerto Rico), which is not affiliated with the Teamsters.  TheConservativeTreehouse.com egregiously misrepresented Rodriguez’s interview, translating it to claim that Rodriguez said truck drivers are refusing to work as part of a plan to show up Puerto Rico’s governor.""Since the country doesn’t care about truckers, the truckers won’t help,"" TheConservativeTreehouse.com quoted Rodriguez. It credits the reporter with getting Rodriguez to admit his defiance.In truth, Rodriguez is saying the opposite, that despite a disagreement over a law signed by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló concerning truck permitting, drivers should help in any way they can. Truckers called off a planned strike because of Hurricane Irma three weeks prior, he said.Rodriguez did take a swipe at Rosselló, saying long lines are partly his fault, and noted that truckers can’t come down when they are in regions with impassable roads. But by and large, Rodriguez said that truckers are working and doing what they need to do to deliver goods.

There are multiple logistical problems slowing down transport, not the least of which is that some drivers simply can’t get to the port, or drive on impassable roads.Bloggers are misrepresenting a real humanitarian crisis by blaming trade unions.

PANTS-FIRE,Blog peddles fake story saying security guards ID'd as shooters at Mandalay Bay,"An online website that describes itself as ""free independent news"" is pushing a false story that a Las Vegas shooting victim saw multiple gunmen dressed as security guards at Mandalay Bay.One of the more pervasive conspiracy-minded claims spinning around the Internet is that the Las Vegas shooting was some type of staged attack or that there were multiple gunmen. As of this writing, there is no evidence any of that is true.However, the website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the shooting reported ""multiple gunmen dressed as security guards.""The post goes on to tell the story of Brian Hodge, an Australian who was reportedly staying on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, the same floor as the shooter.""There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us,"" Hodge is quoted as saying.Later, Hodge said: ""My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor.""While there are some reports a security guard was shot, we are unable to confirm if that’s accurate. And while Hodge is quoted as saying shooters plural, there is no evidence he’d have any way of knowing.Hodge told that newspaper that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and after hearing the bullets he first went to a casino kitchen before hiding in a bush outside.""I was just laying on the ground. It was like a scene from a movie. The shooter was up above, we didn't know where they were... I didn't want anyone to know where I was, so I just curled up and hid. It was the most terrifying moment of my life.""Hodge also posted on Facebook, ""There is a live shooter with a gun in my hotel in Vegas right now, but I got outside safely and hiding in bushes.""And he also disputed saying shooters.An online blog claims, ""Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards.""The story tracks back to real interviews given by a person who says he was at Mandalay Bay. But beyond that, this story doesn’t hold up. The witness didn’t say what the blog claims.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

Another ironically wrote that he ""couldn't even in good conscious photo shop such a picture.""But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day.Looking at the photo more closely, it’s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn’t appear to be giving off smoke.""The changes start with the heart,"" he said. ""This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing.

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about the estate tax, small businesses and farms","""To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax,"" Trump said in his Sept. 27 speech.He continued, ""That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax. ...  The farmers in particular are affected. They have wonderful farms, but they can't pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm.  … So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers.""And the data doesn’t support it.The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax.So how many estates are affected by the tax? Not many, and the people who pay it are usually among the country’s richest families.For 2017, the Tax Policy Center estimated, based on past tax data and modeling, that 11,310 individuals will have estates big enough to file an estate tax return. ""After allowing for deductions and credits, 5,460 estates will owe tax,"" the center concluded. ""Over two-thirds of these taxable estates will come from the top 10 percent of income earners and close to one-fourth will come from the top 1 percent alone.""The top 10 percent of income earners would pay 88 percent of estate tax revenues, the center found, while the richest 0.1 percent could pay 27 percent.How about small businesses and farms? The center projected that only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses would pay any estate tax in 2017. That would amount to about 1 percent of all payers of the estate tax that year. And the estate tax revenue from small businesses and farms, the center said, would amount to fifteen-hundredths of 1 percent of the total paid under the estate tax in 2017.So, getting rid of the estate tax would hardly ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer,"" as Trump put it.Trump's claim doesn't hold up even if you account for small businesses and farms that would potentially benefit from elimination down the road. The number from the Tax Policy Center (80) only refers to the number of small businesses and farms that would have to pay the tax this year.Multiplying the amount of small business and farm-based estate taxpayers who are living today by deaths over the next 70 years would still just result in 5,600 small businesses or farms potentially relieved of the tax — vastly smaller than Trump’s ""millions.""Trump said that ending the estate tax would ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.""That’s a ridiculously high estimate. Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, according to a credible estimate, and of those, about 80 represented small businesses or farms. We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

Andrew Koenig’s office, said the bill does not reference birth control or contraceptives, except under circumstances where employers can refuse health care if they don’t want to pay for birth control.Even with the passing of the bill, Sepper said St. Louis’ city ordinance still prevents employers from firing employees who use birth control, and SB 5 doesn’t affect that protection.A columnist for Feministing claimed that SB 5 will allow employers to fire their workers for using birth control.While the bill will impose higher level of restrictions on abortion providers and allow real estate agents to refuse to sell or rent them land, the bill does not say employers can fire workers for using contraceptives.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Ken Paxton makes unfounded claim that Barack Obama used DACA to 'unilaterally confer' citizenship,"A reader asked us to check on that.Iowa senator touts figuresSo, what citizenship provision was Paxton talking about? By email, Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, replied that DACA wasn’t intended to be a path to citizenship. But, Lovvorn wrote, figures released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicate that 39,514 DACA recipients have been approved for Lawful Permanent Resident status,"" green cards, her email implying that such individuals could later seek citizenship.As of Aug. 21, 2017, Grassley’s release said, 45,447 DACA recipients had been approved for ""advance parole"" with 3,993 applicants getting applications denied. ""This approval,"" the release says, ""allows a DACA recipient to travel out of the country and legally return, making them eligible to adjust their immigration status and receive a green card.""We’ll delve into ""advance parole."" But first, more numbers from Grassley’s release: 59,778 DACA recipients have applied for green cards with 39,514 approved. Also, the release said, 2,181 of the green-card recipients have applied for U.S. citizenship--with 1,056 becoming citizens, which would break out to 0.1 percent of DACA recipients becoming citizens, by our calculation.We spotted no elaboration in the release--and didn’t draw any from Grassley aides or Homeland Security--demonstrating that any of the tallied individuals obtained citizenship by virtue of being a DACA recipient.On the other hand, legal experts supportive of DACA told us the advance parole aspect of the program may have helped individuals attain legal residency and citizenship. In each instance, the experts stressed, a person getting citizenship would first need to have been sponsored by an immediate family member--most commonly a spouse--who was already a legal permanent resident or citizen, which would have been required regardless of an applicant’s DACA participation.Drelichman and others stressed that attaining citizenship, for any immigrant, is a multistep process. ""Only some DACA recipients will be eligible for green cards,"" Drelichman said. ""And the path from green card to citizenship is long and requires meeting certain obligations, including payment of federal income taxes, at least three years of continual legal permanent residency, and passing the"" required ""civics and history exam,"" Drelichman said. ""There is no direct route to citizenship uniquely available to DACA holders.""Employing advance paroleWe dug into advanced parole after hearing back from Arwen FitzGerald, a USCIS spokeswoman, who reaffirmed by email that an estimated 40,000 DACA recipients have received Legal Permanent Resident status and another 1,000 have become citizens.FitzGerald also said: ""The majority of these cases received their status through a grant of advance parole.""That clean-slate distinction can provide a lift because under U.S. law, it’s more difficult for someone living in the country after entering without legal permission to seek legal status.‘An important strategy’DACA recipients (unlike other immigrants seeking advance parole) must present a specific humanitarian, educational or employment reason for traveling to another country, the memo noted. Still, the center advised, someone who obtained advance parole wasn’t guaranteed re-entry. ""When an advance parole recipient presents herself at a U.S. port-of-entry upon her return,"" the center said, ""she will be subject to inspection by an immigration official who will make a discretionary decision as to whether she will be paroled into the United States.""Lawyers commentDrelichman, among expert attorneys we reached, called Paxton's statement ""very misleading."" If ""you have DACA"" status, she said, ""it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a U.S. citizen.""Our rulingPaxton said President Obama used the order creating DACA ""to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship.""It’s flat-out incorrect to say that Obama via DACA conferred citizenship on anyone. That’s not how the system works, and the attorney general should know better. This unsupported characterization traces to a few DACA recipients--about a tenth of 1 percent—who gained citizenship in part by returning from abroad with a clean slate in accord with existing laws not amended by DACA.We find the claim incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, 30,000 scientists have not said climate change is a hoax","Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought.For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate.""The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives.On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn’t speak to either of those conditions.In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation.There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition.First of all, the meaning of ""scientist"" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s of science degree. That’s no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition’s website says that 12,715 signers hold ""BS or equivalent academic degrees.""When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, ""there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth.""That would be about 12 percent of the total.There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site’s figures, most of them don’t specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods.That’s way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians.We also don’t know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, ""The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007.""We reached out to the publishers of News Punch and did not hear back.An article on the News Punch website said that ""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money."" The source is a well-known petition project.The key flaw is that the petition challenges the science, but it doesn’t cast human-driven climate change as a hoax aimed at making some people rich. That is pure interpretation by the website.The use of the word ""scientists"" is misleading, since a signatory need not be a scientist today and need not have done more than earned a bachelor of science degree in any field. The actual number of climate-related specialists is about 12 percent of the total. And these are not currently confirmed signatories as the list has been circulating since 1998.For all these reasons, we rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, ISIS didn't lay down its arms after Katy Perry encouraged world peace","Just about everyone wants to see world peace. But the idea that the bad guys are just going to lay down their weapons has long been a powerful source of ridicule.In a post dated May 24, 2017, but which seemed to gain steam on social media in early September, the website Babylon Bee said that the terrorist group variously known as ISIS or the Islamic State had given up its fight just because American singer Katy Perry had called for co-existence in an interview.The article raised red flags at Facebook, and we’re fact-checking it here as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news.So the Babylon Bee is more openly satirical than some other examples we’ve been forwarded by Facebook, but we’ll still confirm for the record that ISIS did not, after all, stop fighting for an Islamic caliphate just because Katy Perry suggested it.In the interview, Perry said: ""I think the greatest thing that we can do now is just unite as people, as fan bases, all of it, you know? Whatever we say behind people’s backs – because the Internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fan bases go – but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. And no barriers, no borders – we all need to just co-exist.""(Footnote: Perry later performed with Grande at a benefit concert for the Manchester victims.)Some conservative commentators on social media mocked Perry’s remarks as geopolitically naive, though they often did so without noting that Perry had been seeking to promote unity and respect between the fans of different singers, not trying to ideologically reconcile extreme Islamism with advanced democracy.Either way, the story in the Babylon Bee reflects pretty obvious satire, not reality.

PANTS-FIRE,Hurricane Irma can't be a Category 6 storm,"A hurricane with winds in excess of 180 miles per hour is scary enough. But some corners of the Internet are stirring additional panic -- and attracting additional clicks -- by referring to an extreme hurricane category that doesn’t even exist.The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma. At one point, she says, ""The wind speeds are way up there into the category 6 territory.""There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5.The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage.As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm’s path.""Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as ‘strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,’ "" Williams wrote. ""After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today.""The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows:CategorySustained winds (mph)Types of damage174-95Very dangerous winds will produce some damage296-110Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage3111-129Devastating damage will occur4130-156Catastrophic damage will occur5157+Catastrophic damage will occurFrom time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology.A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models.The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however.The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures.""Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph,"" said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. ""At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met.""Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact.In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements.""I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge,"" Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, ""did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm.""Similarly, ""much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3,"" Bell said. ""These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential.""Trepanier said there’s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. ""Irma is a beast,"" she said. ""It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it.""So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm. The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Immigrant tale twists branches of Bruce Rauner's family tree,"Bruce Rauner clearly idolized his maternal grandparents, Clarence and Viola Erickson. From his earliest days in politics, he has repeatedly invoked their memory as role models for the kind of selfless, rugged and generous person that he hoped voters would find him to be.""My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s,"" Rauner said. ""My grandparents did not speak English when they were young.""Variations of the Erickson story have been staples of Rauner appearances for years. But the key word here is ""variations,"" because the governor has not always been consistent in the telling.So what is the real immigrant story of those grandparents Rauner is always talking about? We decided to check.First, a little context. Bruce Rauner grew up in the upscale North Shore suburbs of Deerfield and Lake Forest as well as Scottsdale, Ariz., and his father was a high-ranking executive at electronics giant Motorola. Rauner went to Ivy League colleges, became enormously wealthy as a private equity investor and was the owner of nine luxury homes and ranches when he launched his campaign.  His campaign was clearly sensitive to how that might play with voters as it sought from the first to portray him as a regular guy.Cue the Ericksons as a key component of Rauner’s down-to-earth cred.""Bruce’s grandfather was a Swedish-speaking, small-town dairyman who taught Bruce about fishing and hunting, the value of hard work and the importance of giving back.""""My best friend growing up was my grandfather on my mom’s side. Swedish immigrant. Didn’t speak much English. Lived in a double wide trailer in a cornfield outside Whitewater, Wisconsin. Dairy farmer. Taught me to milk cows. Taught me about huntin’ and fishin.’ Taught me about hard work and giving back.""A few weeks later, as he addressed the crowd at the high-profile signing event for the Illinois Trust Act on Aug. 28, he expanded on his grandparents’ narrative, adding that they came to this country ""in the late 1800s"" and ""did not speak English when they were young.""Notice the difference? When Rauner talks off the cuff about his grandparents, they are immigrants challenged by English. But when Rauner’s official website describes Grandpa Erickson, there’s no mention of him being an immigrant. He spoke Swedish, the website stressed, but that hardly means he didn’t also speak English.What’s more, the census shows that Viola’s mother — Rauner’s great-grandmother — was also born in Wisconsin. Viola’s father, while born in Sweden, emigrated to the U.S. at age 6 in 1868. As for Clarence, the census describes him as speaking English and having a seventh grade education. In the 1940 count, his profession was listed as ""buttermaker.""In Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain called them stretchers -- engaging stories that don’t meet the smell test. Politicians who spin engaging personal narratives can be artful practitioners of the stretcher.Rauner’s grandparents’ story has elements of that genre.No one expects children to have more than a hazy grasp of details about what came before them in the family, and Rauner was just a boy when those close bonds with his grandparents were formed. So it’s tempting to cut his memories some slack.""My great grandparents came to this country, it was my great-grandparents, and my grandparents grew up with them in Wisconsin speaking Swedish,"" Rauner said. ""They were born to immigrants.""Bruce Rauner said his grandparents were immigrants from Sweden who came to the U.S. ""in the late 1800s.""We have no reason to doubt that Rauner’s grandparents meant the world to him. But the Census plainly refutes his claim that they were immigrants. What’s more, both couldn’t have come to the U.S. in the late 1800s because they weren’t even born until the early 1900s — in Wisconsin, not Sweden. Rauner’s assertion in August that his grandparents immigrated to Illinois is yet another inaccuracy.Since we don’t have a time machine, we can’t say for certain what language was spoken in the Erickson and Wedin childhood homes. But to the extent that Rauner implies the Ericksons' facility with English was limited, Census reports refute that notion as well.Topping all that is the acknowledgement by Rauner himself in his 2014 Tribune interview that his grandparents were not immigrants. Still, he continued to repeat the claim on many occasions.Census records and Rauner’s own admission show that this statement has no credibility. That is why it earns our lowest possible rating, Pants On Fire.  "

Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and well we should, by speeding more than $50 billion to FEMA and other agencies.""But as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do, in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do: let us figure out how we’re going to pay for it.""Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren.""While the tweet that’s been shared said Pence urged Congress not to approve Katrina aid, the video that accompanied the piece — and Pence’s full remarks — actually support the opposite conclusion. Pence did not oppose any aid for Katrina victims. He said in his remarks that Congress should pay for relief efforts.What Pence was saying is that Congress should not go into debt to pay for the aid package, and find other solutions to offset costs.It’s no secret Pence is a fan of reducing government spending. Bloggers said a video showed Pence quoting the Bible as justification for ""Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort.""They cited a short 2005 floor speech in which Pence said Katrina relief should pass, but then Congress should look to cut costs elsewhere.

""A third of the counties in Wisconsin are down to one insurer right here. We've got dozens of counties around America that have zero insurers left. So doing nothing really isn't an option.""Ryan has a point about limited competition, but his statement about dozens of counties without a single carrier recycles an old talking point that was never fully right and has become completely wrong today.So not dozens of counties -- just one.Ryan's office said he should have said it was projected to be the case.There’s been a lot of shifting in the exchange landscape.Insurance companies were assessing whether to participate in counties and entire states for 2018. Some places that looked safe suddenly found themselves at risk. Others that were at risk found new companies moving in.We asked a couple of health insurance industry observers what was going on. Equity analyst Lance Wilkes at Sanford C. Bernstein said what we’re seeing is a learning curve in action.""All the managed-care companies were figuring out this market, learning about the customer as well the rules of this program,"" Wilkes said.Wilkes said that in 2014, some large companies such as UnitedHealthcare jumped into the Affordable Care Act exchanges when there was a worry that large employers might shed coverage, sending millions of people into the exchanges.""They needed to be in as sort of a hedge against that,"" he said. ""When that didn’t happen, they got out.""But other insurers started to carve out a niche and came in to fill the gap in stranded counties. The Centene Corporation has been particularly aggressive in Nevada and Missouri. Between the two states, it is poised to offer plans in 39 counties that at some point had no takers.Centene has a different approach than many larger carriers. It has a long history of managing state Medicaid programs where it trims expenses by contracting with a smaller group of health care providers. That can work for lower-income clients who don’t come with the expectation that they will be able to see any doctor they want.""It’s a trade off,"" said Cynthia Cox, who tracks the insurance industry at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""They offer a lower-cost plan but it doesn’t have as many doctors in the network. That doesn't seem to have been a problem for them and their customers.""Wilkes said it also helps that state insurance commissioners are motivated to attract carriers and are ""more willing to offer good price increases,"" which about 85 percent of the policy holders won’t feel because the government subsidizes their premiums. For companies such as Centene, this makes the market relatively predictable.""They might be sicker than average, but so long as the healthy people aren’t priced out, you have a pool that’s stable, and you can price for that,"" said Wilkes.Other companies in other states have also figured that out.Ryan said dozens of counties have no insurers left on the Obamacare exchanges. The day he said that, there was only one such county. Less than a week before he said that, there were two counties. His office acknowledged that he misspoke.Ryan has established himself as an architect of health care reform in the House and the viewers of CNN’s town hall would expect him to have his facts straight.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Republican Senate hopeful's absurd claim Montana Sen. Jon Tester supports a national gun registry,"While declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.We decided to investigate whether Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the opposite is true.This point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry.An important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era’s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers.While some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that’s inconsistent with common parlance.Further, Rosendale’s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to ""the people of Montana,"" and Rosendale’s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry.Did that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners?Not even close.For the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories.The Rosendale campaign’s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry.""The terror watch list is not a gun registry,"" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. ""In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!""David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign’s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn’t add up.""This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,"" Hemenway said. ""He doesn't seem to understand what a registry is.""So Rosendale’s central claim is flat wrong — but he didn’t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to ""ask permission from the federal government"" before they purchase a gun.Because the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim’s absurdity.Rosendale said Tester ""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.""Tester’s record shows opposition to a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and gun owners. To claim he supports this is absurd.We rate this Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrong that Charlottesville counter-protesters didn't have a permit,"Here’s a portion of Trump’s extensive comments about Charlottesville during the session with reporters:""There were people in that rally. I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest.""Because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit. So I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country.""Here, we’ll take a look at whether white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville ""had a permit"" and that the counter-protesters ""didn’t have a permit.""The permit was issued to Walt Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education. The ""special events certificate of approval"" for a public demonstration at two parks in Charlottesville, McGuffey Park and Justice Park. Those are located within one and two blocks, respectively, of Emancipation Park, the location of a Robert E. Lee statue and the destination for the Unite the Right march. The certificate covers Saturday, Aug. 12, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.Click on the markers in this map to see key sites in the clashes on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017. You can zoom in and out.Here’s an image of the certificate, which has been authenticated to PolitiFact by both Heinecke and Miriam Dickler, a spokeswoman for the city of Charlottesville.In an interview, Heinecke told PolitiFact that he had secured the permit as a citizen, not in his capacity as a University of Virginia professor.Heinecke said he sought the permit after seeing what had happened during a July 8, 2017, rally in Charlottesville by Ku Klux Klan members.After KKK members were removed from the rally, Heinecke said, counter-protesters who were also in the area found themselves vulnerable to arrest and potential targets for tear gas.Given this experience, he said, the initial purpose for the Aug. 12 permits in McGuffey and Justice parks ""was to assure that there would be two spaces for lawful assembly"" by counter-protesters. ""What we did was provide food and water, and medics were stationed there. We allowed for that space to be used for peaceful and nonviolent demonstrations, and for protesters at Emancipation Park to have respite from a lawless melee,"" he said.In addition, Dickler of the city of Charlottesville said that counter-protesters would have been permitted even outside of the two park locations specified in the permit. ""A permit does not bar other individuals from entry to a public park (such as Emancipation Park), nor does it restrict who can be on streets or sidewalks outside of and/or adjacent to the park.""For the record, the city of Charlottesville had sought to have the Unite the Right march hold their demonstration in McIntire Park, which is away from downtown. But a court ruled that the march be held at Emancipation Park instead. So the Unite the Right march effectively had judicial permission to hold it there, rather than a city permit.The existence of the city permit issued to Heinecke flatly debunks Trump’s assertion that the counter-protesters lacked a permit -- assuming you understand Trump to mean that counter-protesters had no permit for Saturday’s march.And that’s where the White House told us they differ.The White House told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about a related, but separate, Friday night protest on the campus of the University of Virginia.However, there are a few problems with this explanation.First, no permit was required for any protest on the University of Virginia campus, either from the university (which has jurisdiction on the campus) or the city (which does not).""The University does not require permits to use public spaces,"" said University of Virginia spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn. ""Existing university policy speaks only to the ability to access university-owned facilities such as academic buildings and performance venues.""He added that ""the University of Virginia is a public institution, and as such must abide by state and federal law regarding the general public’s right to access outdoor spaces. This includes open spaces such as … our historic Lawn.""So if Trump meant to refer to the Friday night protest, then he’s wrong here, too. Neither side had permits because there were none to give. Trump said that white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville ""had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit.""In reality, both the Unite the Right marchers and the counter-protesters had official permission to assemble on Saturday, either from a court or from the city. If Trump meant to refer to the Friday night march, then neither side would have needed a permit to assemble. And if he did mean Friday night’s march, then he is seriously distorting the torch-light march by saying participants were ""protesting very quietly.""We rate the statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Tucker Carlson wrongly says United States 'ended slavery around the world',"Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson said on his primetime talk show that while many are arguing for the removal of Confederate monuments because they legitimize slavery, America should get some recognition for stopping the practice globally.Cannick said that offensive or racially insensitive monuments or dedications may be reviewed in time, but Americans should still remember to mark its history properly. Carlson affirmed her answer with a remark about the result of the Civil War.""The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too,"" he said. We don’t know exactly how Carlson was defining slavery, whether as a government-sanctioned practice or criminal enterprise. We reached out to the show and to Fox News Channel but did not get a response.But he’s not right in any case, historians told us.Slavery has been instituted by myriad cultures, empires and nations around the globe for centuries, they said. There have been patterns of abolishing slave trades and then the practice of slavery, before later reinstating them.""If anyone could lay claim to leading anti-slavery forces in the world it was Britain, which after it abolished the slave trade and slavery made anti-slavery a leading aspect of its foreign policy and policed the Atlantic to end the slave trade,"" University of Connecticut history professor Manisha Sinha said.The British stopped its own trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807, and America did the same a year later.The British didn’t officially abolish slavery until 1833. Then other European powers began to follow suit.Several Latin American countries and a handful of other places like the principality of Moldovia banned slavery through the 1850s.Fast forward to the 1860s, when the Confederate States of America’s surrender to Union forces dovetailed with the official end of slavery here. But that wasn’t the last word on slavery.""The 13th Amendment abolished chattel slavery in the United States, but slavery continued in Cuba and Brazil until the 1880s, and in other places in the world well into the 20th century,"" Georgetown University history professor Adam Rothman said.""Slavery still exists in most every corner of the world,"" Siddharth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard, told us. ""When people speak about the abolition of slavery, what they mean is the abolition of the legally sanctioned institution of buying and selling other people like property.""""The global campaign against modern slavery has been going on for a long time under the auspices of international anti-slavery NGOs and organizations like the U.N., which the U.S. participates in,"" Rothman said. ""But at the same time, it's likely that forms of unfree labor akin to slavery lurk in the dark shadows at the end of the global supply chains of American businesses.""Carlson said, ""The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too.""The practice of treating other human beings as property that can be forced into labor continued as official policy for more than decades in Cuba and Brazil after the Civil War. Historians said slavery continued to exist across the world into the 20th century, and conditions comparable to slavery still exist.Any credit for originating the ideals leading to the end of slavery as most people would define it should go to the British, historians said, who formally organized abolitionist thought long before the United States adopted any official policy.We rate Carlson’s statement Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump retells Pants on Fire claim about Gen. Pershing ending terrorism for 35 years,"After a terrorist deliberately crashed a van into a crowd of people in Barcelona on Aug. 17, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the attack. He then suggested that the world should get tougher on terrorism.""The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!,"" Trump tweeted.He later followed up, writing: ""Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!""The person who needs a lesson, however, is Trump.Trump has made this claim about U.S. Army Gen. John Joseph ""Black Jack"" Pershing before. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War.After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies.In Trump’s most-recent telling, 25 years became 35 years.But either way, neither version of the story adds up. The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades.In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics.""While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, there is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts.Experts have been skeptical the practice was widespread or directly authorized or ordered by Pershing.Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to ""pacifying"" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors.""He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.""Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions.""The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,"" Janda said. ""This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.""To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s actions stopped ""radical Islamic terror"" was actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable.Silbey of Cornell agreed. ""Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,"" he said. ""The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism.""If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative.""The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,"" Janda said. ""It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.""Trump said that Pershing stopped ""radical Islamic terror"" for 35 years. Of the eight historians we checked with the first time we heard Trump speak about Pershing, all were at least skeptical that the specific tales of Pershing actually took place, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that.But more critically, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. Trump’s claim rates Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,A ridiculous statement in Republicans' radio ad says Sen. Bill Nelson 'supports murderers',"A national Republican group is misleading Miami voters with a radio ad that says U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson ""supports murderers,"" pointing to the Democrat’s positions on Cuba and Venezuela.Here’s part of the script in English:""In the past, (Nelson) has aligned himself with communists and dictators. Look at him with Cuba. He supported Obama when he negotiated with the other terrorists, the Castro brothers. When Nelson supports the Castros, that only reinforces and encourages others, like it did with Chávez’s and now with Maduro. In 2005, Bill Nelson even visited Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Here it says Nelson went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution. If Bill Nelson supports murderers, I can’t support Bill Nelson.""The fact that Nelson met with Chávez and supported Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba is by no means evidence that Nelson ""supports murderers"" or admired Chávez’s revolution. In fact, Nelson has repeatedly criticized the leadership of both Venezuela and Cuba.In January 2005, Nelson and two other U.S. senators on the Foreign Relations Committee -- Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. and Lincoln Chafee R-R.I. -- met with Chávez in Caracas. In addition to Venezuela, the senators traveled to Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru to discuss counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and economic issues.The senators discussed with Chávez concerns about his relationship with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), though Nelson also described the session as ""very friendly (in) tone.""An NRSC spokeswoman also pointed to a September 2006 editorial in Investor’s Business Daily that describes trips taken by Nelson as ""junkets to Venezuela to admire Chávez's ‘revolution’ in his dog and pony shows."" But the article included no evidence that Nelson admired Chávez’s revolution.""While we cannot accept Chávez's duplicity, his anti-democratic consolidation of power or his ties to Cuba, dialogue between the United States and Venezuela is needed to help avoid the real possibility of a disruption in the relationship with our fourth-largest oil supplier,"" he wrote.Nelson called on the federal government to investigate terrorist operations in Venezuela and called Chávez a ""serious threat"" governing in ""an increasingly autocratic manner"" and ""unfriendly to the civilized world.""""It's time to stand up and speak out,"" he said.""Maduro has made himself dictator, and he and his cronies are bent on turning Venezuela's once-vibrant democracy and once-vibrant economy into a Cuban-style regime,"" he said.Nelson supported Obama’s move in December 2014 to normalize relations with Cuba, but he called for Castro to expand freedoms.Nelson described himself as ""anti-Castro"" but saw Obama’s decision as a step in the right direction.In July 2015 when the U.S. and Cuba opened embassies, Nelson supported the move but continued to criticize Castro.The ad says that Nelson ""supports murderers,"" which appears to be a reference to Chávez, Maduro and the Castro brothers. The leaders have been associated with political violence of different types.Sebastian A. Arcos, associate director at the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said the Castro brothers have a well-documented history of politically motivated killings beginning in the early months of the Cuban Revolution and extending to recent years.Andy Gomez, interim director of the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies, called the attack on Nelson ""absolutely silly.""""Bill Nelson has always been anti-Castro and anti-Chávez and Maduro, the record speaks for itself,"" he said. ""Does the U.S. ever take positions, or any senator including Bill (Nelson), approving atrocities being made to the people? Absolutely not. Has Sen. Nelson ever supported any of these guys? Absolutely not.""The NRSC radio ad says Nelson ""has aligned himself with communists and dictators,"" ""went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution"" and ""supports murderers.""Though Nelson did visit Venezuela with other senators in 2005, he also repeatedly criticized Chávez in 2004 and 2005, calling him a ""serious threat"" and raised concerns about his property seizures, judicial appointments and ""anti-democratic consolidation of power,"" as well as his ties to Cuba. Nelson has also been critical of Maduro, including the recent election, which he called a ""sham.""While Nelson agreed with Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, Nelson called for democratic reforms.This ad grossly distorts Nelson’s record about his visit with Chávez and about his record on the leadership of Venezuela and Cuba.

PANTS-FIRE,Alabama's Roy Moore says whole communities in Midwest are under Sharia law,"On the eve of his first-place finish in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Roy Moore -- a former Alabama judge who advocated for the display of the Ten Commandments -- attracted some attention for a comment he made about Muslim Sharia law.Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation.Moore responded, ""There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don’t know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts.""Stein pressed Moore to name the communities under Sharia law. He responded, ""Well, there’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know.""Later in the interview, Stein tried again, asking Moore to be specific and name which communities he was referring to. Moore said, ""I was informed that there were. But if they’re not, it doesn’t matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That’s not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith -- so there’s a difference.""So are there really entire communities that ignore U.S. law and operate instead under Sharia law?We found zero evidence of it. (We did not hear back from the Moore campaign.)The office of the Illinois attorney general told PolitiFact that there are ""no communities under Sharia law"" in the state. Experts were equally dubious.""Seriously, I've never heard of any such thing,"" said Nathan J. Brown, director of George Washington University’s Institute for Middle East Studies and a specialist on the rule of law in the Arab world. ""I suspect the only accurate part of his statement is when he confesses, ‘I don't know.’ ""Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na‘im, an Emory University law professor, was equally skeptical.""I have not seen evidence of entire communities being run by Sharia law anywhere in the United States,"" An-Na‘im said. In fact, ""it is legally impossible for any community anywhere in the United States to be ‘under Sharia law’ simply because for that to happen, Sharia law must be enacted as the law of the state, and that is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.""Specifically, the First Amendment ""allows for accommodation but not establishment,"" said Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University. ""So, private groups may choose to abide by religious law, such as Jews who abide by judgments made by rabbinical courts and Muslims who might abide by a decision made by their Sharia council or imam. But to assert that Sharia is being enforced by the state is entirely incorrect.""That exception -- the use of religious law to settle intra-community disputes between consenting parties, outside of the United States legal system -- is sometimes a source of confusion for critics of Sharia law, experts said.""If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land,"" Choudhury said. ""So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation. Or, if you marry in the United States, your religious ceremony may not be recognized unless you have a state license and conform to the state's requirements.""Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, agreed that his group knows of no such Sharia-ruled communities.Making such a suggestion, he added, ""feeds into the fear that Muslims are attempting to impose their laws on others in our country. Individual Muslims and their families may voluntarily observe Sharia-related rituals, but this is no different from Jews or Christians living their lives in accordance with the dictates of their own religious traditions.""In the column, Obeidallah jokingly floated ways that Muslims could take advantage of a law that was mostly supported by conservative Christians.""Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose Sharia law in some fashion in Indiana -- turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?"" he wrote. ""Well, the Indiana law doesn’t just provide ‘religious liberty’ for Christians. It provides ‘liberty’ for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. … There are now so many things we can do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America,"" from taking more than one wife to requiring that restaurants institute halal-compliant rules.When we brought Moore’s comments to Obeidallah’s attention, he responded, ""LOL."" Moore said, ""There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there. I don't know.""After checking with multiple experts, we found no evidence of such a community. What we did find was a satirical Daily Beast article headlined, ""Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana."" We rate Moore’s statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Infowars' Alex Jones falsely says George Soros, Hillary Clinton instigated Charlottesville violence","Alex Jones, a conspiracy-minded conservative commentator, said the Charlottesville, Va., protests and counter-protests on Aug. 11-12, were staged acts of civil unrest funded by liberal interests to hurt conservatives and President Donald Trump.Jones then claimed the foundation for the Charlottesville protests is seen in emails between the Democratic Party and George Soros, a billionaire who often supports liberal causes.""It was clear once Trump got inaugurated, they were going to go for civil unrest,"" Jones said.""If you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’""Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’""These are quotes. Hundreds and hundreds of emails,"" Jones said."" We’ve covered them … linking to them.""While Jones offered no evidence the Charlottesville protests were staged, he did say there are quotes from Soros, Clinton or Democratic Party officials in emails talking about controlling minorities and stoking fear in the public to ""keep them desperate"" and ""keep control of them.""So we decided to see if there is any evidence of that.We couldn’t find any. (We reached out to Jones through the media contact form on his Infowars.com website and did not hear back.)Jones claimed the ""Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’""There are 15 emails in the DNC email database that mention the word ""Soros,"" and five of those come from Politico email newsletters. Of the remaining 10, five reference news coverage and one is text of a speech from Trump referencing Soros (""Forget Soros, leave him alone, he’s got enough problems."")The other four are from May 22, 2016, and discuss a mobile application someone was building to support the Democratic nominee. The developer of the application was looking for funding for the project, including from Soros.We also searched under Soros’ Open Society Foundation or OSF. We found four additional emails, the most interesting of which appears to be a communications officer for OSF trying to schedule a tour of the White House.The 2011 email is about unrest in Albania, which included a series of anti-government protests amid corruption charges.In the email, Soros asks Clinton to bring ""the full weight of the international community"" to try and ease tensions in the country. Soros writes that he is particularly concerned of the actions of Albania’s prime minister and that Soros has heard of videotape showing national guard members firing on demonstrators.The most recent emails leaked from Podesta’s account are from March 2016, and seem to be related to a meeting between Soros and Podesta.Here’s the bottom line: Whatever the emails say about Soros’ access to top Democrats, including Clinton, they don’t say anything akin to what Jones claimed.It’s a bit easier to triangulate what Jones was talking about when he said, ""Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them. Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ ""Here is what Clinton said (bold emphasis is ours):Jones said Democrats wanted to keep ""people in their mother’s basement as baristas,"" to ""control them,"" ""keep them desperate."" Jones said, ""if you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public.

Clinton did describe supporters of Bernie Sanders as working as baristas or living in their parents’ basements. But that’s well short of what Jones alleged.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the Obama administration didn't invent the term 'lone wolf' for terrorists","Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, is none too fond of the terrorism-fighting approach of former President Barack Obama. He made this clear during an Aug. 8 interview on MSNBC.However, Gorka’s assertions are flawed, several terrorism experts told PolitiFact. (The White House did not provide any additional explanation in response to an inquiry.)The lone wolf as a metaphor for independent terrorism clearly pre-dated the Obama administration. We’ll also note that Gorka’s claim that there has ""never"" been a serious plot unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida is dubious.This is easily debunked. Just look at a few of the books that used the term in the context of terrorism before Obama took office in January 2009:So, how far back does the term go? Experts said that its specific application to terrorism originated with the ideas of white nationalist Louis Beam, who in the early 1980s advocated ""leaderless resistance."" Tom Metzger, the founder of the group White Aryan Resistance, advocated a similar approach.Over the next few years, the term became increasingly associated with terrorism of all stripes and was used by government officials, academics, and the media.So while the term ""lone wolf"" was used increasingly during Obama’s presidency, its application to terrorism was already decades old, and it was not ""invented"" by the administration.Analyzing this statement requires a bit more nuance, so we won’t factor it into our rating. But the claim is still problematic, experts said.On the most basic level, there have been countless of terrorist attacks that have nothing to do with Islamic radicalism -- starting with the white nationalist movements that helped promulgate the term ""lone wolf"" in the first place. Other examples of terrorism, stemming from a variety of motives, include the 16 lethal bombings by Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski between 1978 and 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, and the series of bombings by Olympic Games bomber Eric Rudolph between 1996 and 1998.Even limiting the universe to post 9/11 attacks with Muslim perpetrators produces some exceptions to Gorka’s firm ""never,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. He cited two attacks without apparent links to al-Qaida or ISIS:• On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but that he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine.• On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself ""a Muslim American, angry at Israel"" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but ""acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization."" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor.Gorka said, ""There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid.""Contrary to what Gorka said, the concept of the lone wolf terrorist predates the Obama administration by decades. We found the term widely used by government officials, academics, and the media, all before Obama took office.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

""The accident claimed the lives of 134 sailors and left permanently disabled another 161 who were dismissed from active duty.""The essay said McCain ""decided to practice a reckless maneuver that day called a wet start,"" in which a pilot sends extra fuel to a jet’s thrusters to create a showy flame on takeoff. The post said that wet start ignited an adjacent plane’s missiles, which fired and hit ""multiple planes filled with explosives all through the carrier’s deck.""McCain didn’t ""wet start"" his jet, but rather an F-4 Phantom about 100 feet away at the opposite end of the deck accidentally fired a rocket because of an electrical surge.The details vary depending on the account, but the rocket hit either McCain’s plane or the plane of fellow Skyhawk pilot Lt. Cdr. Fred White.A fragment also punctured the fuel tank of another Skyhawk next to White, spilling more fuel and igniting it. The rocket itself fell into the ocean without detonating, but a bomb from one of the aircraft exploded as crew members rushed to put out the flames. (Subsequent reports have noted modern bombs would not have ""cooked off"" the way the Korean War-era munitions did, contributing to the disaster.)Narrated video of the event showing the explosion is available on YouTube:McCain managed to escape his cockpit through the flames, suffering burns and shrapnel wounds in his legs and chest. He described the conflagration in his book:""All around me was mayhem. Planes were burning. More bombs cooked off. Body parts, pieces of the ship, and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck. Pilots strapped in their seats ejected into the firestorm. Men trapped by flames jumped overboard. More Zuni missiles streaked across the deck. Explosions tore craters in the flight deck, and burning fuel fell through the opening into the hangar bay, spreading the fire below.""McCain wrote that he helped dump some bombs over the side of the ship before heading to the ready room and then sick bay to treat his wounds. He acknowledged the crew managed to control the flight deck fire by that afternoon, but below-deck fires lasted for another 24 hours.""The fires were consuming the Forrestal.

PANTS-FIRE,"Is Amazon a ‘no-tax monopoly,’ as Donald Trump said?","President Donald Trump took to Twitter to launch his latest salvo at Amazon, accusing the company of being a monopolistic tax cheat.The president’s description of Amazon struck us as questionable. So we decided to look into it.With more than $136 billion in sales last year, there’s no doubt about Amazon’s status as an online shopping empire.But Amazon is not a monopoly, said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on antitrust law.A monopoly exists when a company so dominates a market that it can reduce output and cause a rise in prices over a substantial period of time. This level of market control is outlawed by antitrust statutes designed to promote competition for the benefit of consumers.""We measure an antitrust violation by looking at consumer harm -- not harm to competitors,"" Hovenkamp said. ""Most complaints about Amazon come from competitors. By and large, Amazon is pretty good with customers, so you don’t usually hear consumers squawking about this.""Monopoly law typically kicks in when a company controls about 75 percent of a given market, Hovenkamp said. He noted that in 2000, Microsoft was deemed to be a monopoly because of its control of over 90 percent of the market for Windows-based computers.But no U.S. tribunal ― whether federal or state court, or the Federal Trade Commission ― has ever found Amazon to be a monopoly, Hovenkamp said.Trump is wrong to say Amazon is not subject to tax.Like other businesses, Amazon pays taxes on corporate income, property, payroll and unemployment insurance, said Joseph Henchman, the executive vice president of the business-backed Tax Foundation. Amazon has also recently changed its policy on state sales tax, he added.According to regulatory filings, Amazon paid a combined total of $412 million in federal, state, local and foreign taxes last year. In 2015 it paid $273 million in combined taxes, and $177 million the previous year.But Amazon has faced criticism for taking advantage of tax breaks and loopholes.Nonetheless, Trump is wrong to say they’ve avoided tax collectors altogether.At the state level, Amazon, which launched online in 1995, long resisted charging a sales tax. But by 2012, it was collecting and paying sales tax in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.Today, the company collects taxes in all states where state sales taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. (all states except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon collect sales tax). Henchman noted that taxes apply to all of Amazon’s own sales, but not the large percentage of sales by other sellers using the Amazon platform.The digital retail giant’s decision to collect state sales tax is mostly voluntary.That’s because a 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively restricts states from forcing online retailers to pay state and local sales taxes if the company has no brick-and-mortar property or employees in the state.""We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system,"" Amazon wrote in its 2016 regulatory filing.Currently, Amazon does not have physical buildings or employ workers in all the states where it charges taxes, though its footprint has grown in recent years and may grow larger still if its plan to acquire Whole Foods comes to fruition.Trump said Amazon has a ""no-tax monopoly.""Amazon is an industry giant, but it does not exert enough market control to be considered a monopoly, and no U.S. tribunal has ever deemed it as such.While Amazon takes advantage of tax breaks and loopholes, it pays federal corporate tax, and charges sales taxes in 46 U.S. jurisdictions. It also supports federal legislation that would require other online retailers to pay state tax on internet sales.Trump’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!"

Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.Captions on photos of the two houses say the girls won’t be getting the mansions because President Donald Trump will return the mansions to the Russian government, but the fate of the properties hasn’t been confirmed yet, hence Peskov’s demand.""There are a whole host of issues we're discussing with the Russian Federation, but my commitment is that we will consult with you on this issue before any final implementation of an agreement that we don't have yet with the Russian Federation,"" Sullivan said.The source of the fake news, Newsfeedhunter.com, even admits its stories are fabrications.We rate this statement Pants on Fire!"

The most famous actual 1916 attack occurred on the Jersey Shore, in salt water.We also found no credible reports of disappearances on the lake.A disclaimer at the bottom of the story calls NotAllowedTo.com a satire entertainment website.""We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on this Web Site,"" a disclaimer reads.This claim is bogus.

Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.""Obama was not even traveling abroad during that time, said Kevin Lewis, Obama’s spokesman. ""The last time that he was in Germany was about a month ago,"" Lewis said July 11.We reached out to world-politicus.com but did not get a response.World-politicus.com published a post headlined, ""Obama Goes To G20 Summit,"" adding ""Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up, too.""Obama has attended previous summits, but his spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that he was not present at this year’s event, ""nor was he in Germany.""

PANTS-FIRE,Fake news story twists Paul Ryan’s words on poor people’s health care coverage,"A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news.""What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it,"" Ryan said.Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox’s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That’s where the story turned to fiction.""Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it,"" Ryan is quoted. ""So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy.""Ryan didn’t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan’s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes.Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites.What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here.The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference.Ryan did discuss how the Senate’s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor.We rate this claim Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,It's fake news that James Comey and Debbie Wasserman Schultz are an item,"Take an FBI director controversially fired by President Donald Trump (James Comey), add in an ousted Democratic National Committee chairwoman (Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.), and whip up an air of illicit love and it’s not hard to assemble clickbait gold.If you can suspend all common sense, that is.The article posits that the website has uncovered an affair lasting at least eight months between Comey and Wasserman Schultz. (For the record, both are married.)Let’s get quickly to the bottom line: This allegation is complete and utter hooey.We are fact-checking it because Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news.Comey’s paramour, according to the article, is ""none other than the DISGRACED former Chair of the DNC, Debbie ""Whiny Democrat"" Wasserman Schultz — talk about a match made in Heave… errrrr… Hell! These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can’t accept defeat, but that doesn’t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?""The website cites ""our exclusive sources"" to support the idea that the two ""couldn’t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they’re two liberal sickos — and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them.""The article suggests that Comey’s criticism of Trump, the man who fired him, stems from a desire to ""impress his GIRLFRIEND. Pathetic.""Neither Comey’s nor Wasserman Schultz’s camp commented for this article, but debunking this item is straightforward: Freedomcrossroads.us is a self-styled parody site that operates for clicks that earn advertising money.Its modus operandi is to troll social media users susceptible to believing overheated conservative rhetoric.The site, it says, ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today’s aging conservative. All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.""Such disclaimers, however, are nowhere to be found on the actual article page, which makes it easy for some readers to miss the joke.Freedomcrossroads.us published an article that said ""James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With"" Debbie Wasserman Schultz. As the website itself acknowledges on another page, this is all a ""crock of doody."" Only one rating fits: Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,It's fake news that the president can disband the Supreme Court,"A June 21 fake news story on USPOLN.com reported that White house press secretary Sean Spicer declared that the president holds the power to disband the U.S. Supreme Court.""President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision,"" Spicer is quoted as saying in the story.The story claims Spicer shared this information in a press briefing media outlets were banned from airing, in which he also announced Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims of a U.S. Navy ship wreckage and of a terrorist attack in London.The press conference the post references indeed took place, on June 19. While it was not televised, a transcript was shared on the White House website. Spicer did offer the White House’s condolences to the victims and said Mueller’s fate was in Trump’s hands, but he never suggested the president holds the power to disband the Supreme Court.In fact, the Supreme Court was not mentioned during the briefing.The story manipulated Spicer’s quote that ""everyone who serves the president serves at the pleasure of the President,"" referring to the fact that Mueller’s superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, ultimately answers to the president. The Supreme Court, however, does not.The checks and balances put in place by the U.S. Constitution are designed to ensure equilibrium of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches — that means one branch can’t just shut down another.The Constitution prohibits the president from firing a justice, much less all nine of them, or disbanding the institution they represent. It also hands power over to the courts to decide on the legality of an executive action.The president may nominate Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges and district court judges, although these must be vetted by the Senate. Neil Gorsuch is the only Supreme Court justice Trump has appointed so far.The website that published the story did not respond to a request for comment, but it does contain a disclaimer published in the ""about us"" tab.""USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist,"" the disclaimer reads. ""These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""While some of the details about the press conference are correct, Spicer’s comments about the presidential ability to disband the courts is complete and total baloney.We rate this statement Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the Australian government is not installing microchips in citizens","A fake item circulating online gives the false impression the Australian government is implanting microchips in its citizens.We decided to take a closer look after Facebook users flagged it as suspicious.Microchips implanted in human bodies can transform how people tackle everyday tasks. They emit frequencies that do everything from unlocking doors to logging onto computers, removing the need to turn a key or flip a switch.While it’s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there’s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims.But there’s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so.This bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.We rate this statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Story about Checkers shooting came from fake news generating website,"An online post that said the manager of a fast food restaurant killed 10 employees was created by a fake news generator apparently devised as a prank.Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. As of this writing, the post was shared almost 2,700 times.The post is fake, because every post from Channel24News.com is fake.

Now Create A Story & Trick Your Friends!"" Clicking on the button allows a user to write a headline and body text, and upload a photograph to illustrate it.

This is a Prank website that is intended for Fun. Bullying, Violent Threats or posts that Violate Public Order are NOT permitted on this Website.""Of course, a ""prank"" about a shooting at a fast food restaurant is a bit on the violent side, but as of this writing the Checkers story had not been removed.As a word of warning to readers, it’s probably best to be wary of any article coming from Channel24News.com.We rate this particular statement Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Pete Olson said Bill Clinton basically told Loretta Lynch 'we killed Vince Foster',"A Texas congressman said President Bill Clinton intimidated the government’s lead lawyer into not seeking an indictment of Hillary Clinton by telling her, ""We killed Vince Foster.""Did Clinton, desperate to help his wife, declare as much about killing Foster, the White House deputy counsel at the start of Clinton’s two terms?Olson, R-Sugar Land, initially said in his radio interview that it was ""awfully strange"" for Bill Clinton to bump into then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an Arizona airport tarmac at a time in 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s handling of email was under Justice Department review.""I guarantee you,"" Olson said, ""they had the conversation where he basically said, ‘Mrs. Lynch, call your attack dog off. We’ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you.’ And then what happens to things?,"" Olson said. ""All of a sudden--well, she did it, yeah, it was all terrible, don’t know who got the information, very classified. But no indictment.""Olson was correct about about a few points.But we identified no evidence for Olson’s claim that Bill Clinton told Lynch the Clintons killed Foster.Lynch insisted at the time that the airplane conversation centered on topics such as Clinton’s grandchildren. Our search of the Nexis news database turned up no Bill Clinton accounts of what was discussed.A delayed backpedalInvestigations""The Fiske investigation involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses; also DNA tests, microscopes and lasers,"" the newspaper reported.""The report concludes that Foster was severely depressed about his work at the White House, took a revolver from a closet in his home, placed it in an oven mitt, and on the afternoon of July 20, 1993, drove to a Virginia park and shot himself,"" the story said. ""And it contains new forensic details that refute the conspiracy theories that have long surrounded his death – that Foster was a victim of foul play, or that his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park after his death at another location, perhaps the White House,"" the story said.Previously, the story said, Fiske and two bipartisan congressional panels similarly concluded that Foster took his own life.By email, we connected with Berman, who said of Olson’s claim: ""There is not a scintilla of fact in this statement – it is a blatant falsehood, unsupported and unsupportable. There were four investigations into Foster’s death, all arriving at the same conclusion.""Our rulingOlson said Bill Clinton said ""we killed"" Foster.There’s no evidence of Clinton saying as much nor a factual basis for anyone to say the Clintons killed Foster. This claim, which Olson backed off after it became widely known, adds up to a baseless accusation.Pants on Fire!"

""Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.""Now, it’s obvious that Ryan hasn’t announced Trump is resigning. But other clues also show that the story is bogus.The story also quoted one Paul Horner, which is the name of a big-time writer of fabricated news stories. One of his trademarks is always putting his own name into his stories.Among his often-used calling cards in online stories are the use of the byline Jimmy Rustling, numerous references to ""Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin"" and a plea to donate socks to the homeless.There’s otherwise no contact information for the website.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that CNN ratings are ‘way down’,"Since the stakes of television viewership appear to loom large in the mind of the president, we decided to look more closely at CNN’s trendline.Trump’s claim that CNN’s ratings are down raises the question: compared to what?Because his tweet made no mention of other cable news networks, we assume Trump is comparing CNN’s current ratings to past ratings.Television experts we spoke to about how to gauge CNN’s trajectory suggested we compare CNN’s numbers from one year to the next, based on data from the second quarter (in 2017, second quarter ratings went from March 27 through June 25).To get a comprehensive view, we were told to look at ratings across several benchmark metrics, broken down by audience demographics and viewing times.Bottom line: CNN is at a five-year high in each of the categories we looked at, according to data provided by the Nielsen Company.CNNRatingsPrimetime,Total ViewersPrimetime, 25-54Total Day,Total ViewersTotal Day,25-542017 Q21,055,000371,000788,000263,0002016 Q2959,000312,000627,000188,0002015 Q2560,000195,000430,000138,0002014 Q2459,000156,000341,000105,0002013 Q2666,000228,000475,000161,000So when it comes to comparing CNN’s current ratings to past ratings, the verdict is clear: They’ve moved up in several major categories compared to recent years.CNN just posted it's most-watched second quarter in history.

It also points to thousands of photos taken by the Chinese Yutu moon rover, which launched in December 2013 and ceased to operate in July 2016, stating these ""showed no trace"" of the Apollo moon landing.While the rover did take many photos, Andrew Jones, a journalist following China’s space program, points out that Yutu landed far from the Apollo landing site, so there wouldn’t be evidence one way or another.""It had traveled tens of meters in total, when it would have needed to travel thousands of kilometers over varying and hazardous terrain to visit all the Apollo landing sites,"" Jones said.

PANTS-FIRE,The Pants on Fire claim that Ossoff supporters celebrated violence against GOP,"An attack ad released on the eve of Georgia’s special House election claims Democrat Jon Ossoff has the support of ""unhinged leftists"" who celebrated the shooting of Republican lawmakers.The video, from a group calling itself Principled PAC, opens with the sound of gunfire over footage of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., being wheeled on a stretcher. Scalise was critically wounded in the June 14 attack on a GOP congressional baseball practice that left five others with gunshot wounds and the shooter dead.Republican Karen Handel, Ossoff’s opponent in the June 20 race, condemned the ad. Handel campaign aide Kate Constantini said the group behind the video ""should be ashamed,"" and denounced efforts to use the recent shooting for political gain.The premise of the ad is alarming and incorrect. We searched for evidence of applause for the shooting and came up empty. There is a further lack of evidence that those cheerleaders are then supporting Ossoff.Principled PAC did not respond to requests for explanation.Recent events, partly connected to the Alexandria, Va., ballpark shooting, have set the historically Republican district in northern Atlanta on edge.Handel called for calm and unity in response to those reports.The following day, Handel and her neighbors received suspicious packages at their homes containing threatening letters and an unidentified white powder substance.A letter Handel’s neighbor shared with the media told the recipient to ""resist the fascist takeover,"" and appeared to borrow Marxist language, condemning the ""bourgeoisie.""There is no evidence it was mailed by someone who supports Ossoff, or has any connection to the Democratic nominee. If the ad writers had this news in mind, they jumped to a connection that was not based in proof.Meantime, some residents of the district said they’re too scared to put out a yard sign for fear of retribution.Principled PAC said, ""The same unhinged leftists cheering last week's shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff.""For any statement we fact-check, the speaker carries the burden of proof. Principled PAC did not respond to multiple requests seeking information to support its incendiary claim linking Ossoff to a celebration of violence against Republicans.We were unable to find a single example of someone cheering the recent shooting of Republican lawmakers and voicing support for Ossoff.We rate Principled PAC’s statement Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Claim that Trump welcomes Jamaica as a U.S. territory is fake news,"An undated post on CNewsGo.com claimed that President Donald Trump had finally confirmed the rumor of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory, but the story continues to be nothing more than a hoax.The unnamed author claimed Jamaica has become a permanently inhabited territory of the United States with its own organized government as determined by an Organic Act passed by Congress. There is no date provided for the decision, and we could not find any legislation relating to such news.This is because Jamaica is its own country, declaring its independence from the United Kingdom and creating its own constitution in 1962. The United States then established diplomatic relations with the country and has maintained them to this day.Trump met with Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Audrey Marks in early April, when they discussed bilateral trade, but they made no mention of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory.This story seems to prey on common geographical ignorance; we couldn’t help noticing during our research that a frequently googled question is whether Jamaica is located in the United States.

PANTS-FIRE,Anti-Ossoff ad in Georgia House race distorts lines from Obama's book,"In the most expensive congressional race ever, outside groups are making a final push to move the needle in what’s expected to be a very close contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff in a suburban district north of Atlanta.Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump organization, lofted a radio ad aimed at cutting African-American turnout for Ossoff. In the ad, black conservative Autry Pruitt warned African-Americans against being taken for granted by Democrats, using the words of the first black president to make his point.Here’s the text:""Hi, my name is Autry Pruitt, a fellow black American working hard every day, just like you. It may seem out of season, but all of a sudden, Democratic politicians have started coming around again. We normally only see them every other November, swarming around and making promises to get our vote. But nothing ever changes for us, does it? Here's what President Barack Obama had to say about it:""""Let's not sell out for another Christmas turkey. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Democrats keep taking our votes for granted.""Did Obama really complain that Democratic politicians only pay attention to African-Americans when they need their votes?No.A sentence before the book excerpt that appeared in the radio ad gives those words a different meaning. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington.Here’s how the scene plays in the book:""Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,"" Smitty said. ""Before Harold, seemed like we’d always be second-class citizens.""""Plantation politics,"" the man with the newspaper said.""That’s just what it was, too,"" Smitty said. ""A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we’d reward ‘em with the vote.""In the book, Obama went on to describe the power of African-Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified.""They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded,"" Obama wrote.In Smitty’s words, ""When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life.""In contrast to the suggested meaning in the ad, the passage is about the good things that come from voting.Through a Great America Alliance spokesman, Pruitt rejected the idea that he had cited Obama out of context.""The clip of President Obama was absolutely in context on this issue and helps make our point in the ad, which is why we used it,"" Pruitt said.Great America Alliance said that Obama complained that Democrats continue to ignore blacks except at election time. Obama did say the words used in the ad, but they weren’t his.He was quoting a Chicago barber talking about the days before African-Americans in Chicago helped elect the city’s first black mayor.The full text from Obama’s book shows that he was arguing that voting can make a difference. Nothing in the section suggests that he thinks Democrats today only pay attention to blacks at election time.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"

I know it’s a time of concern for people who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on, and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers.

They’ve marched, they’ve bled — yes, some of them have died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before; we can do this again.""On the face of it, Lynch didn’t say what Infowars asserted. She didn’t call for anyone to commit violence. The violence she described was inflicted on those who marched to defend the rights of individuals. She said they bled and they died. She didn’t say they caused others to bleed or others to die.Infowars said Lynch advocated ""violence and murder."" She did not.

PANTS-FIRE,Warmest year on record a hoax because of margin of error? That’s wrong,"Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld says people who cite statistics about the hottest year ever or high temperatures are spreading ""B.S.""He says people who make such claims are not telling the full story about temperature statistics.""So, those are called real truths,"" he continued. ""The poetic truth is the chaos and the hysteria, because that plays to the media. And it makes you feel so important. And you get to punish America for being so successful by doing these stupid deals. But if you read the facts about the high temperatures, about the reality of our past, it is all B.S.""We interviewed several scientists who said Gutfeld’s statement -- that temperature increases are within the margin of error and therefore not increasing --  is wrong. Rather than point to ""single year"" increases, experts said that long-term trends clearly show the temperature has been rising for decades.Robert Jackson, chair of the department of Earth System Science at Stanford, said Gutfeld’s statement, scientifically speaking, ""is rubbish.""There are two main sources of data cited to look at temperature trends: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA Goddard institute for Space Studies. Both show a trend of rising temperatures.Rising temperatures should be measured over many yearsGutfeld focused on ""single year"" increases.Such comparisons don’t tell the full story about rising temperature, because there is natural variability year over year. It is more useful to look at long-term trends such as comparing decades, said University of Miami’s Ben Kirtman.The statement by Gutfeld ""indicates a profound misunderstanding of climate science and statistics,"" Kirtman said.""Year over year you can’t be sure that one year is a statistically separate warming from the previous year, so you have to take a little bit longer view to remove some of the natural fluctuation,"" he said.NASA’s latest annual data released in January 2017 shows that temperatures have been rising upward since the 1960s: Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean -- making 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures, NASA concluded.NASA stated that even taking into account the uncertainties in the interpretation of year-to-year temperature differences, NASA estimated 2016 was the warmest year with greater than 95 percent certainty.NASA attributed the rising temperatures driven largely by ""increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.""Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001.Uncertainties can arise in the data due to different methods in dealing with missing data and weighting the two hemispheres; however, the uncertainty is quite small, said Kevin Trenberth, a  Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.Trenberth said that 2014 was the warmest on record at that point, but perhaps not outside uncertainty. But 2015 broke that record well outside the uncertainty, and then 2016 further broke that record, again well outside any uncertainty.  So 2014-16 are the warmest three years on record, he said.Reto A. Ruedy, an expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Gutfeld’s statement ""lacks any logic.""""It argues that anything that changes less than the margin of error within some arbitrarily selected time interval (here a year) necessarily does not change,"" he said. ""By the same logic you can argue that babies don’t grow in size, since within a day or even a week they grow less than the margin of error in determining their size.""The long-term trend which shows an overall rise in temperature since 1880, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado.""Gutfeld uses flawed logic to claim that there is no trend. But there is a trend,"" he said.  ""The lesson here?  Always look at the actual data.""Our rulingGutfeld said, ""every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing.""While some years are within the margin, others definitely aren't, so Gutfeld is wrong when he says ""every single"" year is within the margin of error. Also, long-term trends over decades show that temperatures are clearly rising. So Gutfeld is wrong both on the details and and the big picture. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Story that Donald Trump will split Marines from Navy is unfounded,"So it would be a pretty big deal if President Donald Trump acted to officially separate the two military branches from each other.That’s what a widely shared item on the website Vet TV said. Is it true?The short answer: No. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds.Setting aside the tiny likelihood that the administration knows in detail what executive orders Trump will be signing on a specific date six months down the road, there is no evidence to support the notion that he will be splitting the two branches.""We have not heard anything about that. Semper Fidelis,"" said Marine Capt. Ryan Elizabeth Alvis, a public-affairs official at the Marine Corps headquarters.The Navy referred PolitiFact to the office of the Secretary of Defense, which referred us to the White House. The White House declined to comment on the record.As it happens, there may be an explanation for why the article ran. Vet TV bills itself as an entertainment and humor site for veterans -- though it would be hard to know that from the web page in question.However, the article about the Navy-Marines split does not include a prominent ""satire"" label, and much of the text of the article itself rather mundane. As a result, it would be easy for social media users to think that word of the inter-branch split was legitimate news.With the Navy-Marines article, ""the first part of the piece isn’t very humorous at all,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Only deeper in the article does the satire become more obvious, he said, such as this passage: "" ‘The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia,’ Sgt. Major Garrett explained.""Janda said that the article does draw on a deep well of competition, and even tension, between the two branches.""The U.S. Marines were modeled on the Royal Marines in the same way that the early U.S. Navy modeled itself on the Royal Navy,"" he said. ""Marines served on every ship, just like today. They fought as sharp-shooters or with bayonets in ship-to-ship encounters, made up landing parties, guarded the captain, and enforced discipline when needed. In mutinous situations they almost always stayed loyal to the captain, and for that reason, and because they enforced ship discipline such as executions and floggings, they were usually hated by sailors. Some of that mutual enmity, driven by rivalry and respect, endures today.""O’Malley did not reply to an inquiry sent through his website.We rate the Vet TV statement that Trump is removing the Marines from the Navy as Pants on Fire."

""And for him to convey a message of 'Don't slow down, go do your job, there’s a lot to get after with the government,' I think was a good message.""It’s wrongheaded to extrapolate from Chaffetz’s statement that Trump gave his imprimatur to a ramped-up investigation into Clinton.Chaffetz’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But there’s no evidence Trump has personally urged him to keep the pressure up.Our rulingA number of bloggers said President Trump greenlighted Congress to ramp up the Clinton investigation -- and used a video clip of Chaffetz to advance this claim.But these bloggers have mischaracterized the video. In it, Chaffetz describes a meeting in which Trump offered general words of encouragement and emphasized the importance of Congress’ oversight function, without reference to Clinton, or any specific investigation.At no point in the video does Chaffetz say Trump greenlighted, encouraged or even hinted at the need to ramp up an investigation into Clinton.We rate this statement Pants on Fire."

Facebook users flagged the story in an effort to identify potential fake news.WikiLeaks published thousands of emails a few days after Rich’s death. Some conspiracy theorists have concluded that Rich must have been the one who leaked the emails, and was killed to scare other potential leakers. WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for more information about Rich’s death, drawing some attention to the scenario.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never said Rich was the source.Most of the PatriotCrier.com conspiracy theory is based on this unfounded insistence that the FBI has proof of this connection.""It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement, but the fact is the FBI has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey, locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three,"" the PatriotCrier.com post read.It’s quite a stretch to pin on an anonymous federal investigator that Comey examined the evidence, drew a conclusion that proved Rich was the WikiLeaks source and then hid it specifically to protect Clinton.Wheeler didn’t even mention the former FBI director, and we didn’t find any evidence of Comey commenting on Rich’s death. The entire conspiracy theory had been under the radar, confined to corners of the Internet, until Wheeler’s story emerged, by which time Comey had been fired by President Donald Trump.An FBI spokeswoman confirmed only that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department.The Metropolitan Police Department, meanwhile, is still investigating Rich’s death as a homicide.PatriotCrier.com said, ""Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source and covered it up for Hillary.""The website’s assertion that Comey knew Rich was WikiLeaks’ source of the DNC emails and hid the evidence to protect Clinton is a wild assumption based on refuted evidence. A private investigator had claimed that the FBI had analyzed Rich’s laptop and found proof that he had given the emails to WikiLeaks, but then recanted his story. Fox News and its network affiliate, which had broadcast the story, later retracted it.There’s no evidence there’s any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong.With no concrete proof of this far-fetched claim, we rate it Pants On Fire!"

""During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed.

That means eating, exercising, showering and even, yes, using the facilities while lying down.A NASA spokesman told us that there have not been any sleep studies that involved consuming cannabis. There also aren’t any more sleep studies currently planned, so it’s not like NASA is suddenly going to try it the next time.Blog posts that have been saying that NASA is paying subjects $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke marijuana for 70 days are pretty far out.The only lighting up we see here is when we rate this Pants On Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,The baseless claim that slain DNC staffer Seth Rich gave emails to WikiLeaks ,"Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016.WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder.The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right.Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation.Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC.""But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?"" asked the WTTG-TV reporter.""Absolutely,"" Wheeler replied. ""Yeah, and that’s confirmed.""So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case.The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity.All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit.There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack.Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich ""apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians.""There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination.The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work.Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Dan Patrick's $20,000 tax savings claim proves incorrect, ridiculous","Texas Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick made such a dramatic claim about ""must-pass"" tax-rate legislation--$20,000 in savings for the average homeowner every year!--we launched a fact check.Patrick, mindful the House then had yet to vote on SB 2, said the Senate-approved version of the measure ""would bring about the largest property tax reform in Texas history. It would bring local government spending under control, give the voters an automatic election on government spending, of anything over 5 percent, and,"" Patrick said, ""save the average homeowner in Texas $20,000 a year over the next 20 years or so.""Patrick aide: He meant $20,000 cumulativelyBettencourt offers backup         In phone messages, Bettencourt noted that the association’s analysis suggests that over five recent years, through 2015, the owner of a median-valued home saw a nearly 34 percent escalation in property taxes paid to the local government entities targeted by SB 2, which averages out to increases of more than 6 percent a year. Those entities are cities, counties and special districts though not school districts.How the chart gets to a $22,761 cumulative savings in year 20 figure: It shows first-year savings under SB 2 for the median-value homeowner of $46, second-year property tax savings of $99 with annual savings exceeding $1,100 starting in year 12--and topping $2,100 a year starting in year 17.Each year’s savings, the chart shows, reflects the difference between what the homeowner would face in local property taxes if all government units raised taxes 8 percent minus what the homeowner would face if the local government entities all raised taxes 5 percent.Realistic tax-rate assumptions?We asked Bettencourt about the basis of the chart’s assumption that local governments will every year across-the-board raise effective tax rates 5 percent and if it’s realistic to compare that to an assumption that such governments would otherwise uniformly be driving up rates 8 percent every year.In phone messages, Bettencourt stressed the TTARA chart showing the recent average 6-percent-plus increases in property taxes charged the owner of a median-valued home. Separately, Dale Craymer of TTARA declined to comment.Actual county, city tax rate changesAdvocates for cities and counties say the senator’s assumption--that local governments will always uniformly raise effective tax rates to the maximum level allowable without risking a rollback vote at the polls--doesn’t reflect what Texas governments have been doing.Texas A&M expertBy phone, Gaines said TTARA presented an accurate figure on its spreadsheet for a median-valued Texas home.But Gaines called ""highly questionable"" the assumptions behind the dollar figures in Bettencourt’s chart--both of local governments uniformly and annually driving up effective tax rates 8 percent without a change in law and of such governments under SB 2 all increasing rates 5 percent year after year.Counties, for instance, don’t act identically, Gaines said. ""Each county is going to be unique,"" he said.Comptroller makes no homeowner savings estimateAnd in fiscal 2019, the first year of tax effects, cities, counties and special districts would lose nearly $199 million in revenue, the comptroller’s office estimated, an indication of some taxpayer savings, it seemed to us. The  hypothetical shows additional costs to affected government entities in subsequent years.Does the hypothetical lost revenue, we wondered, mean the comptroller got a fix on how much homeowners and other property taxpayers might save?By phone, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, Lauren Willis, said the agency has not estimated particular savings for homeowners. Tim Wooten, a comptroller consultant who worked on the table, told us by phone that’s because ""we can’t predict what local taxing entities will do"" in setting rates or if voters indeed will reject all increases at the polls.We asked Wooten to unpack how he reached the hypothesized revenue losses. Wooten said he applied the SB 2 limits to 2015 tax rates set by the targeted entities, finding that in that year, 60 percent of cities and special districts and 70 percent of counties did not set rates high enough to touch off the rollback elections envisioned in SB 2. Wooten said too that a lot of the remaining government entities would have sustained small 2015 losses in revenue if SB 2 had been law then.Bettencourt stands by $20,000-plus figureFollowing up, we asked Bettencourt if most local entities covered by SB 2 don’t reach existing or proposed rollback tax rates, aren’t homeowner savings impossible to precisely forecast?When we said it looked to us like his projected homeowner savings were based on unrealistic assumptions about all the affected government entities maximizing tax rates every year, Bettencourt replied: ""Disagree strongly,"" urging us to revisit the spreadsheet he attributed to TTARA.Our rulingPatrick said legislation targeting local tax rate growth will result in the average Texas homeowner saving $20,000 a year over 20 years.That’s an absurd amount. Even if we look at what Patrick purportedly meant to say — $20,000 over 20 years — we find major flaws in the assumptions underlying that calculation. To reach that amount, one must assume that every city, county and special taxing district will raise tax rates by 8 percent every year without this legislation in place and by 5 percent a year with it. Neither assumption is in line with recent history, making the total savings figure highly suspect, at best a wild guess.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Brad Schimel falsely claims there is no ‘backlog’ of untested rape kits in Wisconsin,"Thousands of rape kits collected in Wisconsin in recent decades are now scheduled to be tested as officials seek to identify serial rapists or find leads on unsolved crimes.Is Schimel — a Republican who is up for reelection in 2018 — right to claim the untested kits are not a ""backlog""?The backgroundThey include cases where victims choose not to pursue charges, defendants confessed or the issue was consent rather than identity, Schimel said in the Up Front interview.But, he said, authorities have realized in recent years the value in going back and testing those cases, since sex offenders typically have more than one victim.""If you test that DNA, you might link that defendant to another unsolved case out there,"" Schimel said. ""So we’ve recognized the need to go back and look at these, but it’s not a backlog.""The state Justice Department determined 3,800 of the untested kits would be tested, though only if the rape survivor consents. But the process hasn’t moved quickly.But it will take about two years to test all the kits, based on figures DOJ provided. About 800 kits have been sent to Bode so far, and the testing process can take as long as six months for a single kit.Backlogs have been an issue at DOJ before. The crime lab it oversees fell far behind as DNA testing exploded in frequency in the mid-2000s, with 1,800 cases on crime lab shelves awaiting testing in 2007 when Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen took office. He hired 31 additional analysts and declared in 2010 that the backlog had been eliminated.Schimel has emphasized the state crime lab has kept up with testing new sexual assault evidence under his watch and rape kits didn’t become viewed as uncompleted work until state authorities shifted their perspective of it recently.Schimel disagreeing with himselfSchimel’s claim that the word ""backlog"" is inaccurate runs into trouble when compared with, well, his own past statements.That word choice is in line with the definitions used by popular dictionaries.Now, however, Schimel and his spokesman are saying that word is not appropriate. Koremenos said the term implies DOJ is to blame for the untested rape kits when ""this is not a DOJ shortcoming.""Our ratingSchimel says it is wrong to describe the untested rape kits as a ""backlog,"" arguing it implies blame on the department under his watch.But the definition of the term does not involve how or when a backlog began. The department has decided that the work should be done — a process that began slowly and is on pace to stretch out for up to two years, based on the current capacity and pace. That’s a large accumulation of uncompleted work.And that’s the definition of a backlog.The fact that Schimel himself previously used the term makes his claim not only wrong but ridiculous.We rate Schimel’s claim Pants on Fire.USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter Keegan Kyle contributed to this story."
PANTS-FIRE,Torching Greg Abbott's claim Travis County sheriff declared she wouldn't hold violent criminals,"Still, did Hernandez declare that she wouldn’t detain known criminals accused of violent crimes, as Abbott said?Abbott offers no backupWe asked Abbott’s office for the basis of his fresher claim and didn’t hear back.You could read the governor to have said that Hernandez, who was sworn in as sheriff in January 2017, put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars — a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds.But in the context of Abbott's mention of ""sanctuary city policies,"" he surely was referring to Hernandez’s announced policy, effective Feb. 1, 2017, that the county would no longer automatically grant requests by federal authorities to ""detain"" specified suspects for up to 48 hours so agents could investigate and possibly hasten deportation.Policy says…The policy states the sheriff’s office ""shall comply with ICE detainer requests under the following circumstances: (a) when the detainer request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or court order for continued detention or notification, to the extent required by the judicial warrant or court order; or (b) when the individual who is the subject of the ICE detainer is charged with or has been convicted of the following felonies under Texas law: (1) Capital Murder, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.03; (2) Murder -- First Degree, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.02; (3) Aggravated Sexual Assault, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 22.021, and (4) Continuous Smuggling of Persons, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 20.06.""Separately, we noticed, the policy leaves wiggle room for the sheriff to hold inmates facing other charges. A portion states the office ""reserves the right to exercise discretion in any individual case to ensure that justice is served.""Policy in practiceWhen we asked the sheriff’s office about Abbott’s claim, spokeswoman Kristen Dark said by email that no inmates placed in the Travis County Jail ""will be released without making bond or having his or her charges disposed by a judge.""Abbott’s description of the sheriff’s detainer policy, Dark wrote, wasn’t accurate because the policy provides for detainers to be granted automatically for several violent crimes and also gives the office discretion to ""ensure that justice is served.""Dark wrote: ""In each and every case,"" the office’s ""command staff reviews an inmate’s current charge/s as well as criminal history. If there is any indication of violence in that data, the ICE Detainer Request is honored,"" she said.A spreadsheetThe sheet doesn’t show past convictions for any crimes, so we didn’t see a way to reach conclusions about individuals not being detained despite their criminal histories.But what about letting individuals go despite current violent-crime charges?Over the two-plus months, according to the sheet, ICE detainer requests were approved by the department for around 200 individuals charged with crimes, with many individuals listed as remaining in jail. Charges filed against the detainer-approved individuals include sexual abuse of a child; manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and driving while intoxicated, according to the sheet.The sheet identifies 15 individuals already released to ICE in response to detainer requests. Related charges include DWI; assault causing bodily injury; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (two men); terroristic threat of a family member; manufacture of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver; possession of marijuana; burglary of a habitation; sexual indecency with a child; and aggravated sexual assault of a child.  On the flip side, the sheet lists about 90 individuals mostly released by the county after detainer requests were denied.Many of the people were arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated or possessing small amounts of marijuana, neither of which would necessarily signal a violent crime.We counted nine individuals among the 90 who were each arrested for an alleged assault causing bodily injury to a family member--domestic violence, Dark told us by phone. Eight of these inmates were released on personal recognizance bonds, the sheet states, after the sheriff declined to approve a detainer requested by ICE; the ninth was released by a judge’s order, the sheet says.We asked Dark about the rationale for declining detainers on those individuals. By email, Dark replied: ""The nature of the behavior that resulted in the arrests was not aggravated and therefore, did not meet the threshold required for"" the office to automatically ""honor the ICE detainer request."" Dark said by phone that further research revealed that five of the individuals had previously been released to ICE, possibly even deported.Dark’s email said: ""If ICE has past experience with the individuals, they should know the status and be able to quickly get a warrant or court order. If presented with a warrant,"" the sheriff’s office ""would gladly have turned these inmates over to ICE upon the disposition of their charges by a judge,"" Dark said.The sheet shows too that a man who allegedly made a terroristic threat was released on a personal recognizance bond after the sheriff denied a detainer request. Dark said by email the individual had allegedly told a security guard at a bar, ""I’m going to shoot you."" Dark said no weapon was found in his possession.Our rulingAbbott said Hernandez ""declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes.""That’s a distortion of Hernandez’s statements and her announced policy. The sheriff made it clear she wouldn’t automatically honor all requests to hold suspects for ICE. But the policy specifies several violent crimes for which the department directly grants the hold requests and it reserves the office’s right to exercise discretion in the interests of justice.Abbott, a seasoned judge and former state attorney general, should know better. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"

By Democrats?With multiple investigations under way, we don’t know whether there was collusion between members of the Trump team and Russian interference in the election.But that isn’t the question. The question is whether Democrats plucked the idea out of thin air.A few highlights from the past year say otherwise.First, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report expressing with ""high confidence"" that the Russian government put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump.In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency was investigating Russian efforts to interfere with the election.Comey added that the investigation began in late July 2016.Asked what evidence it took to launch this sort of investigation, Comey answered, ""A credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power.""Let us pause here to note that these points alone rebut Trump’s description of this story.The investigation began with the FBI, not the Democrats. It started in July 2016, a full three months before the election. It was not invented, but was based on evidence serious and credible enough to launch an investigation.We can go further.Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating, and Republicans control both chambers. Democrats don’t set the agenda.Steven Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists, a group that advocates for more transparency in government, said the fact of a Trump campaign-Russia connection is well established.""It is supported by statements from Trump family members and associates, who have described financial relationships with Russian sources,"" Aftergood said. ""The only question is whether the various Trump-Russia connections violated any laws.

That is the start of the story, more than three months before the election.The American intelligence community expressed with confidence that Russia aimed to interfere in the election to harm Clinton and help Trump.Democrats did not create the story, nor do they control the agenda of the House and Senate committees which are conducting their own investigations.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Paul Ryan's Pants on Fire claim on Air Force pilots forced to scrounge for airplane parts in museums,"And he made a claim -- about the Air Force and museums, of all things -- that we want to check.""That was the Obama rule that we lived under for eight years. They insisted on this even as our military plunged further and further into a readiness crisis. Well, we got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years.""So, this is a sweeping claim: Air Force pilots, crippled by inadequate funding, being forced to scavenge for parts in museums to keep their own planes flying.Typically we don’t use many quotes in our fact checks. But in this case, they seem to tell the story about Ryan’s claim:Our colleagues found that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz. -- a practice that goes back decades because it saves money and keeps the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made.But that fact check didn’t get to whether the Air Force takes what seems like a more desperate step of sending parts hunters to museums.So, Ryan’s evidence is pretty thin: An isolated example to back a broad claim.Expert viewsOur ratingSaying the military was plunged into a readiness crisis under Obama, Ryan claimed: ""We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years.""It is a broad claim, but his office cited only one news article that quoted an Air Force captain as saying parts for seven planes were obtained from ""museum aircraft.""Meanwhile, defense experts told us that Ryan’s claim was highly misleading, in that any such museum scrounging, if it has ever occurred, is isolated. Indeed, the Air Force operates a base whose main functions include storing thousands of planes to be available for spare parts.The experts also agreed that even as defense spending dropped under Obama, the Air Force had sufficient funding to prevent the need for pilots to hunt for airplane parts in museums.We rate Ryan’s claim Pants on Fire.Editor's note: This item was updated on June 9, 2017 to say that the Fox News report did identify one museum. That information does not change the rating."

""It’s a rumor and there’s nothing to verify it,"" campus spokeswoman Cindy Posey said.Police chief a day laterCarter replied: ""So one of the things that bedevils police departments on occasion is the information that comes across social media.""Yes, we’ve heard that,"" the chief said. ""We have no verification of that. I will tell you, if you look at the sequence of events and the timeline, it doesn’t appear likely.""The officer observed the individual walking away from an individual who was down on the ground,"" Carter said. ""He was armed with a large, Bowie-style hunting knife."" The officer confronted the man, Carter said, drawing his weapon and ordering the man to the ground. Then the suspect was taken into custody.No changes, UT saysWe asked UT if there were developments since the knife attacks suggesting a student with a gun helped quell the attacker.By email, Shilpa Bakre replied: ""This is an incorrect rumor."" Bakre said a UTPD officer ""took the suspect down and arrested him – no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this.""Our rulingA web blog said a UT student used a concealed gun to help police stop knife attacks on the campus.In a week-plus after the attacks, there were no credible news reports or law-enforcement confirmations of this claim which looks to us like it was bandied by pro-gun advocates presuming or perhaps wishing it was so.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Was Chelsea Clinton charged with fraud as Clinton Foundation shut down? No, it's fake news","A fake news story that reads like a page out of conspiracy theory Mad Libs said that Chelsea Clinton was charged with essentially stealing from the Clinton Foundation, which had been ordered to shut down.The post was flagged as being potentially fake by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from user feeds.For the record, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra said the post is definitely incorrect.The story is full of falsehoods and paranoid nonsense, the details of which are almost certainly deliberately inane. For example, one passage reads:""During (Hillary) Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, it’s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with the creator of ISIS and Osama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories.""Bin Laden, who trained the 9/11 terrorists, was then sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death. Documents linking the Clinton Foundation directly to General George Hammond of SG Command were the final piece of the puzzle.""The fake post then focuses on how Chelsea Clinton supposedly ""used her family foundation’s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents.""In any event, Chelsea Clinton remains free, and the Clinton Foundation is still open for business.We rate this headline Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, coffee is not the second-most traded commodity after oil","Starbucks has a reputation for serving a strong cup of joe, but the ubiquitous coffee retailer’s director of public policy offered a claim on Capitol Hill that turns out to be a thin brew.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee invited Starbucks’ Kelly Goodejohn to talk about how doing well can mean doing good. A 20-year veteran of the coffee trade, Goodejohn had some key points for the senators.""Coffee is grown in challenging regions, often with war-torn pasts, but we have seen coffee as a stabilizing force that provides prosperity and economic stability,"" she said.Coffee, Goodejohn said, is a big economic deal.""Coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil, and 25 million farmers around the world rely on income generated from growing coffee,"" she said.Holy latte! We’ve all seen coffee take off in America, but are those beans really the other black gold? We decided to check Goodejohn’s ranking of oil and coffee.The hard numbers show her statement has been provably incorrect for about as long as Goodejohn has been in the business.Comparing the goods Part 1: Market sizeSince oil comes in barrels and coffee beans in 60 kilogram sacks, you can’t just stack them side by side. So the most obvious comparison is the dollar value of the world market for each.Calculating the world market for coffee is a little trickier because the United Nations trade data lumps coffee in with other products that contain even just a trace of coffee, such as powdered mixes.The keen observer will note that the coffee market is about one-fourth as large as the markets for aluminum and copper, and also less than the market in iron ore.""This used to be the case back in 1970,"" Baffes said. ""However, later grains and metals overtook coffee.""In that 2000 report, coffee ranked 15th, bested by, among others, hardwood logs, bananas and gold.Over the years, there have been several efforts to correct the record.""I was wrong, and so is everyone else who keeps repeating this myth,"" he wrote in 2009.At one time, coffee represented the second-most valuable commodity exported by developing countries, but there’s no evidence that’s still the case.Comparing the goods Part 2: Futures tradingThis seemed to suggest that Starbucks had another yardstick in mind -- the number or value of coffee contracts bought and sold by investors. In other words, we shouldn’t measure the amount of actual coffee or costs, but the bets on coffee prices.Pendergrast said, ""I don't think that this urban coffee myth has ever been true, regardless of how you look at it.""Our rulingA Starbucks executive said coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil. We examined it two ways, and the statement failed on both.The markets for several commodities including soybeans, wheat, aluminum, copper and iron ore are larger than the coffee market -- in some cases, four times larger.The statistic also falls short in terms of the commodity contracts traded by investors. Both the number of coffee contracts traded and the value of contracts are much lower than for many other commodities.This claim has been challenged since 2000 by economists, journalists and voices in the coffee industry. But it still found its way into a congressional hearing despite being very, very wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Raul Labrador's claim that no one dies from lack of health care access: Pants on Fire,"What Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told a restive town hall audience in Lewiston, Idaho, was destined to go viral. And it did.""You are mandating people on Medicaid accept dying,"" one audience member said.To which Labrador responded, ""No no, you know that line is so indefensible. Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.""Given all the attention to Labrador’s comment, we decided to fact-check it.However, Labrador’s statement put a different twist on the question. Rather than saying that a specific number of people had died due to lack of health insurance, Labrador said that no one had. Could that be right?Labrador’s explanationHowever, even if you buy the argument that emergency room care would protect the uninsured, that leaves out a whole range of chronic and potentially deadly diseases -- from heart disease to diabetes -- that can be prevented only through long-term access to physicians.A literature reviewWe found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. In general, these papers present a stronger consensus that having insurance saves lives.Any contrary views?We found two papers that might conceivably provide support for Labrador’s position. But as we’ll see, even the papers’ authors did not agree with Labrador.So we asked both of these papers’ authors whether their papers could be used as justification for what Labrador said.""Rep. Labrador is misinformed,"" Kronick said. ""Common sense, as well as the accumulated weight of evidence is sufficient to convince any reasonable analyst that lack of health insurance results in excess morbidity (that is, sickness) and mortality.""Baicker, too, said she sees ""strong evidence"" that Labrador’s statement ""is false. I agree that the exact number is up for debate, but the fact that it is more than zero seems clear to me.""Every other health policy analyst who responded to us for this article agreed that Labrador was wrong. Some saw common sense as equally persuasive as the peer-reviewed research.""I was just at a physicians’ meeting where people described patients they had treated who had died because of a lack of coverage,"" said Harold Pollack, an urban public health researcher at the University of Chicago. ""Everyone who does this for a living has personally experienced it in one way or another.""Our rulingAt the town hall, Labrador said, ""Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.""Extensive research over the previous decade generally points to tangible reductions in mortality after patients obtain health insurance. Two papers found more equivocal results, but we reached authors of both papers, and they agreed that their findings do not support Labrador’s remark. While the exact number of deaths saved by having health insurance is uncertain, the researchers we contacted agreed that the number is higher than zero -- probably quite a bit higher.We rate his statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Wawa Welcome America: The largest free concert in the USA? Really?,"On April 13, Wawa, Inc. and Welcome America, Inc., a nonprofit in partnership with the City of Philadelphia, sent out a press release to announce Wawa’s continued commitment to hosting Wawa Welcome America, Philadelphia’s Fourth of July festival. Wawa confirmed it will continue to host the 25-year-old celebration through 2019.The citywide, six-day festival includes fireworks, free museum admission and what the press release claims to be the largest free public concert in the country:""The Wawa Welcome America festival is the nation’s signature July 4th celebration in the birthplace of our nation. This multi-day, citywide festival features all FREE events such as America’s largest free concert, some of the nation’s largest fireworks displays, outdoor movie screenings, free museum days, neighborhood events and more.""Melanie Sole, a spokesperson for Welcome America, explained it’s pretty difficult to accurately compare crowd sizes from events in different cities because ""every city counts things differently and there are many factors to be aware of when comparing city to city.""Crowd size estimates also tend to have political- and business-related biases. A prime example is the Trump administration’s claim that the president’s inauguration crowd was much larger than it appeared to be in aerial photos.The specialists at DDIS are able to provide some of the most accurate estimations of crowd size partly because of a kind of technology they developed themselves called a balloon test, which isn’t an actual balloon, but a ten inch orb tethered to float above a crowd and use laser rangefinders to scan the area. The Federal Aviation Administration bans flying helicopters over large gatherings for safety purposes, so without a balloon test it’s difficult to get a good aerial view for a measurement tool.Even without use of the DDIS’s resources, to get an even close to accurate estimate, ""you must have high resolution photos, you must have orthographic views, and you must have lingering resources to determine a peak [in attendance],"" President of DDIS Curt Westergard explained. It’s not an easy measurement to get correct.Inaccurate counts can lead not only to dangerous situations regarding people in the crowds getting swift access to resources in emergency situations, but also make comparing sizes at different events extremely difficult.""We make our comparisons to other publicly reported data by other Independence Day concerts plus review available data from the music industry and other sources,"" Sole said of Welcome America’s crowd size estimations.She added, ""No other free Independence Day concert in America makes our claim nor has sought trademarks as ‘America’s Free Largest Independence Day Concert.’ There may be other data not publicly available or known to us.""Even assuming the estimations Welcome America is relying on are accurate, 175,000 people definitely isn’t the largest free concert audience in the United States, as shown above. Concerts at inauguration events and New Year’s Eve celebrations regularly top that count.In a separate email, Sole added quite a few more qualifiers to the initial statement, asserting that the Wawa Welcome America concert is the ""longest, diverse, inclusive, free, live concert event on July 4th—Independence Day.""Even restricting the comparison to that day, Philadelphia’s concert still isn’t the biggest.Sole also provided a list of additional criteria Welcome America uses to distinguish its event as the biggest nationwide:• The Parkway is one continuous space with unobstructed views from Love Park to the Main stage for one, continuous, live concert experience. The Parkway can accommodate a range of crowds compared to other venues in other cities that may have multiple ""official"" sites.• Factors in the counting of attendees--over time--include the timing of the Parkway pre-concert entertainment, the length of the live concert, diversity of performers, audience appeal, fireworks timing, weather and other factors (such as day of the week—this year July 4th is a Tuesday versus a long weekend or weekend day itself).• Review of Philly’s July 4th historical data and the Independence Day crowd estimates reported over time by the media and other sources along with visual evidence (such as pictures and videos).• We include live broadcast ratings and live streaming viewers. All portions of Philly’s events are live, never taped.However, none of these criteria were included in the original statement, which just claimed Wawa Welcome America features the largest free concert in the country-- not just on the Fourth of July and not based on the diversity of performers or the length of the live concert or whether the view of the stage is continually unobstructed.Today, Welcome America put out another announcement unveiling Mary J. Blige as the headliner for this year’s concert. This press release instead lauded the event as ""America’s largest free Independence Day concert.""Our rulingThe original claim in Wawa and Welcome America’s press release stated Wawa Welcome America features America’s largest free concert.Welcome America Spokesperson later reiterated in an email that the organization measures a variety of factors including length of the concert, whether it’s live and whether there is an unobstructed view of the stage throughout the crowd. She also revised the initial claim and instead referred to the concert as the largest one in the US on Independence Day (which is still not totally accurate).Regardless, what we’re fact checking is the original statement from the press release.Philadelphia can certainly claim it has a pretty huge Independence Day celebration, but Wawa Welcome America is definitely not the largest free concert in the United States.We rate this claim as Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Maxine Waters wrong to say she has 'not called for' Trump's impeachment,"More than perhaps any member of Congress, Rep.

""I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people. … I will fight every day until he is impeached.""She then proceeded to start the crowd on a chant of ""Impeach 45,"" referring to Trump, the 45th president. The crowd responded to her invitation, and Waters led them by chanting ""Impeach 45"" three times. She then closed her speech saying, ""Go ahead: Impeach 45"" before exiting the stage.Waters didn’t seem to be hiding the fact that she had chanted ""Impeach 45.""The same day she appeared on MSNBC, Waters retweeted a CNN video clip of her speaking and leading the chants.Our rulingWaters said on MSNBC that ""I have not called for impeachment.""She has at times called for investigations that could lead to Trump’s impeachment, rather than calling for impeachment directly. But on at least two occasions -- the Cheddar interview and the tax rally -- she did call for Trump’s impeachment directly, in one case literally cheerleading for impeaching Trump at a rally at the U.S. Capitol.

The story said Obama was the bill’s author and therefore, he is the one collecting this $411 million. The conspiratorial implication is that Obama actually is Soetoro. (Soetoro is the name of Obama's stepfather, Lolo Soetoro.)FederalistTribune.com said the money was split among accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. That last one is actually the name the Roman Empire gave to the region that is now Scotland.That’s a patently absurd assertion about the law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and was later dubbed Obamacare by skeptical Republicans to taunt Obama.The site’s articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, usually without an indication that they are fake.At any rate, the tale of Obama using an alias to bilk millions from the U.S. Treasury for naming his signature health care law was made up.We rate the statement Pants On Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Fake news story falsely quotes Kasich saying some women not smart enough to decide on abortion,"A fake news story that made Ohio Gov. John Kasich appear to degrade women while discussing abortion actually is a bogus story first posted on an often-cited parody website.The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds.Kasich allegedly made the remarks after vetoing the so-called ""heartbeat bill,"" a bill that would have outlawed abortion in Ohio once a fetal heartbeat could be detected. At the same time, he signed a bill that made abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal, unless the mother’s life was in danger.The post, which is fake, said Kasich defended his actions by saying women weren’t as strong as they were in ""the old times."" They made poor decisions for themselves, including abortions, so Kasich had to take action, the article said.""If a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion,"" the post quoted Kasich.What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them.

PANTS-FIRE,76 patients did not die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,"Assemblyman Michael P. Kearns has called for a federal investigation into the number of deaths at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center.""I was shocked to learn of these numbers from the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,"" said Kearns, a South Buffalo Democrat. ""Seventy-six deaths in three years equate to about 25 patients a year dying at this facility.""Kearns has an intense reason to focus on the Buffalo facility. He opposes a state plan to close the Western New York Children’s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca, located in his district, and relocate its patients to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center by the end of 2018.The state has said there will be a separate entrance and wing for children at the Buffalo facility, but opponents of the plan still do not want children relocated.Kearns wants an independent investigation of the Buffalo facility before the consolidation, but the state calls that unnecessary. The state also disputes the number of deaths Kearns has cited.So, who’s right? Did 76 patients die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center over three years?How many died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center?The state requires facilities like the Buffalo Psychiatric Center to report the number of deaths that happened on-site and also certain deaths that happened away from the facility.Every patient death — inpatient or outpatient — must be reported, whether the death is related to treatment or not. If someone receiving outpatient treatment dies in a car crash, for example, that death would be reported.The facility also must count people who die within 30 days of ending treatment, regardless of the circumstances.Kearns cites 76 deaths because that’s the number reported between June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016, on a document from the state Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs. An advocate for children with special needs obtained the document through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared the information with Kearns.But the Justice Center calls Kearns’ claim inaccurate.""It would be inaccurate to assume that all 76 deaths listed in this FOIL response to have  physically occurred at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,"" the Justice Center said in a statement.  ""The information provided includes a listing of all deaths reported to the Justice Center of individuals receiving residential services at a particular facility or who had received such services within 30 days of their death.""Further, ""please be advised that we do not track where the death occurred, since a death could occur in a location that is not under the jurisdiction of the Justice Center, such as in an emergency room,"" the response said.The state Office of Mental Health, which runs the Buffalo facility, confirmed in an email that 13 people died on-site at the facility in the same time period.""During the time frame in question, there were 13 deaths on the Buffalo Psychiatric Center campus, all due to natural causes,"" according to a statement from the mental health agency.  The 63 other deaths did not happen at the facility and could be unrelated to any treatment. The state did not have a breakdown of how many of the 63 people who died were still patients at the time of their deaths.Our rulingKearns said 76 patients died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center between June 2013 and March 2016.The number is misleading. The state Office of Mental Health confirmed 13 deaths at the facility during that time. The remaining deaths did not happen at the facility.We rate his statement Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Did Adolf Hitler use chemical weapons? Sean Spicer wrongly says Hitler didn't sink to that level,"Sean Spicer turned heads in the White House briefing room during a discussion of the situation in Syria when he wrongly claimed that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons.Spicer, President Donald Trump’s top spokesman, was discussing why Russia might withdraw support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and referenced Assad’s attacks on his own people.""You had someone who is despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons,"" Spicer told reporters April 11, 2017.Spicer attempted to clarify his point when pressed by reporters.""He was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,"" Spicer said. ""He brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that. But (not) in the way that Bashar al-Assad used them where he went into towns, dropped them down, into the middle of towns.""We believe Holocaust centers refers to concentration camps.Spicer appears to be trying to limit his definition of chemical weapons to those dropped from planes or fired through cannons, as Assad has been alleged to have done. That sells short the definition in the Chemical Weapons Convention, which took force in 1997.1. ""Chemical Weapons"" means the following, together or separately:(a) Toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for purposes not prohibited under this Convention, as long as the types and quantities are consistent with such purposes;(b) Munitions and devices, specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those toxic chemicals specified in subparagraph (a), which would be released as a result of the employment of such munitions and devices;(c) Any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of munitions and devices specified in subparagraph (b).The Nazis’ hydrogen cyanide meets the first condition and the gas chambers would qualify as a ""device"" in the second.There is no mention that chemical weapons are only those used on the battlefield.Brian Finlay, president of the Stimson Center, a Washington defense policy group, told us that ""the Nazis would surely have been in contravention of the (Chemical Weapons Convention) had it being in effect during the second World War.""For what it’s worth, the consensus view is that Hitler did not use chemical weapons in battle.But Spicer’s qualification that Hitler didn’t use them on his ""own people,"" overlooks that German Jews were full citizens until they had their rights stripped away by Hitler’s totalitarian regime. A large number had assimilated and some had become Protestants. It’s possible Spicer was thinking of Austrians, Hitler’s birthplace, but Austrian Jews fared no better than German ones.Our rulingSpicer said Hitler never used chemical weapons. The Nazi regime brought an industrial approach to mass murder of its citizens and others it sought to exterminate. The construction of gas chambers and the use of deadly gas was fundamental to that strategy.While the convention against chemical weapons did not exist in World War II, the modern definition would encompass the Nazi gas chambers. It makes no difference whether victims are brought to a room filled with deadly gas, or if the gas is sent to them in a bombing raid.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

In short, White has not suggested this, something Sims spokesperson Dan Siegel acknowledged in a phone conversation, admitting that White had never said it. She hasn’t introduced or supported any legislation that would lead to the deportation of all immigrants, either.White’s discussion of any policy involving immigration has mostly been limited to sanctuary cities. Last week, she reintroduced a bill that would strip hundreds of millions in state funding from Philadelphia if it continues to not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials as part of its sanctuary city status.She emphasized in a statement responding to Sims’ fundraising message she supports legal immigration and has never suggested all immigrants be deported.""I find it disgusting that Rep. Sims would try to raise money by blatantly lying about me and using such derogatory terms about a fellow legislator,"" she said. ""The fact is that I fully support and welcome legal immigration, and - as a state Representative - I do not weigh in on federal government policy regarding undocumented immigrants presently in our country.""My concern is rogue public officials who violate federal law to further their own agendas. Perhaps Rep. Sims should spend more time focusing on protecting the people of Philadelphia and upholding the law he took an oath to follow instead of lying and playing politics.""Siegel compared White to Trump, pointing out the similarities of her sanctuary cities bill and the president’s executive order threatening to slash federal funding from sanctuary cities.        ""I think it’s fair to say that she views an America that is very homogeneous,"" Siegel said, ""and I think her actions have shown that she doesn’t have a whole lot of respect for folks who have come to this country and tried to build a life here.""Our ruling Rep. Brian Sims claimed in a fundraising message fellow state Rep. Martina White ""wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America.""

Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to clear fake news from users' news feeds.The story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public.We reached out to the website but got no response. (Neonnettle later emailed us to say it deleted the post.)Their argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high.Healthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery.  But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy.Again, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry.While the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet’s case even comes close. And even that is a stretch.As for sourcing, neonnettle.com refers to thebigriddle.com, which posted the exact story a year ago. Thebigriddle.com cites conspiracyclub.co as its source, a site that doesn’t exist anymore.Our rulingThe article puts forward a conspiracy theory that is based on the actual deaths of American doctors, but there is no information that they worked together on vaccine discoveries, nor were their deaths connected.  The conclusions in the article are pure speculation.We rate this claim Pants on Fire. "

PANTS-FIRE,Will the federal government require devices to slow down motorcycles?,"An estimated $35 price tag for the speed governors would cost New Hampshire’s motorcycle riders more than $2.5 million to bring all 73,000 bikes registered statewide into compliance. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the 8 million-plus motorcycles across the United States into compliance, based on the article published by Associated Media Coverage.Despite the alarm, there was never any such rule proposed, much less mandated.The apparent news story with the headline """"New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017,"" wasn’t true. There was no requirement to install speed governors, and the article’s lone quoted source, James Littleton, a purported representative of the DOT, doesn’t appear to exist.Nevertheless, it reached nearly 10,000 people – perhaps more though social media – within a matter of days, according to a cached version of the article, which was subsequently removed. Maybe those readers – 5,500 of whom clicked the like button on the Associated Media Coverage website – should have slowed down.In addition to removing the article, the website Associated Media Coverage appears to have rebranded itself. Its old URL now redirects to a page called The Seattle Tribune. It also adopted a marginally less-confident tagline: its old motto ""News You Can Trust"" is now simply ""Informing the Nation.""PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to examine this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017.

PANTS-FIRE,"Still no Notebook 2 despite fake news rumors, but we'll keep waiting","Fans of The Notebook have waited even longer for a sequel to the beloved movie than Allie waited for Noah.Some of them rejoiced recently when news broke that The Notebook 2 was already set to film on the North Carolina coast.""The very popular 2004 romantic drama film The Notebook is finally getting a sequel,"" reported the website WBN10. ""Producers of the upcoming film confirmed the news today and announced that filming will begin in Jacksonville, North Carolina this summer.""It later continues with some key details, sure to excite locals: ""The film will take place primarily in the Jacksonville area and will film on location there as well. A casting call for extras will reportedly take place in the Jacksonville area in a couple of months.""We were intrigued, and broke out a box of tissues just in case the tears started flowing.What’s more, Nicholas Sparks – author of ""The Notebook"" and other popular books – lives in New Bern, not far from Jacksonville.

But sadly, it’s fake news.'This sequel, they said, would be starring Reynolds in the place of Ryan Gosling and O’Brien in the place of Rachel McAdams.So we were pretty sure his Notebook 2 announcement was a joke.But the article circulating about Jacksonville and the film was not nearly so satirical.It correctly named the director of the first film and the place in South Carolina where it was filmed, it gives a brief outline of the plot and has several quotes from unnamed producers from the unnamed company that was allegedly behind the film.The website does contain a disclaimer that it’s a satirical site, but it takes an extra click or two to find and isn’t immediately obvious.And just in case the website had accidentally stumbled onto the truth, we checked with the people who would know if there actually are plans for this movie in the works.Alas, they say, there’s no Notebook 2.""We have not been contacted by this production,"" said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission in eastern North Carolina.And the N.C.

Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, ""I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun.""The fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail.None of the other websites flagged by Facebook indicate the story is contrived, either.

PANTS-FIRE,Western PA congressman backs off ‘strange’ Obama shadow government claim,"Republican Congressman Mike Kelly was talking to a crowd in his district of Northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this month when he dropped a serious accusation against Barack Obama. He noted the former president had decided to stay in Washington, and not for the reasons Obama has given.Is that really what Obama stayed in Washington, D.C. to do?No reports or intelligence has been released linking these post-presidency activities of Obama to a shadow government. And Kelly did not provide any evidence. A shadow government is commonly defined as a conflicting, secondary government led by members of the private sector that wields similar influence to the actual government.Kelly later withdrew his comments after they made national news. His spokesperson Tom Qualtere said, ""Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly’s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government."" In another statement, Qualtere said, ""he was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump’s agenda.""A spokesperson for Obama did not respond to a request for comment.Our Ruling Congressman Mike Kelly accused President Barack Obama of operating a shadow government, saying he was only staying in Washington, D.C. for that ""one purpose and one purpose only.""

The parents had supposedly found the baby (alive) in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce with bite marks on the boy’s arms and legs.So even in the context of the post, he didn’t really get eaten.

Bruce Rauner said he was presenting a balanced budget.""Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation"" the governor said.The next morning, his campaign sent an email underscoring that he had offered a balanced budget proposal for the next fiscal year.The ad’s narrator says, ""Bruce Rauner's plan to balance the budget reforms Illinois, builds a new economy, freezes property taxes, caps spending, pays down the debt and term limits politicians' power.""With so many assertions that Rauner, who has yet to sign a budget into law since his election in 2014, had proposed a balanced revenue and spending plan, we decided to check it out.Balancing the rhetoricIllinois has not had a full budget enacted into law since 2014. In 2015, Rauner vetoed the budget bills majority Democrats approved, except for the bill that funded pre K-12 education. His 2017 budget proposal is his third since taking office after winning election in his first run for a public position. He previously worked as a highly successful private equity financier.The ""grand bargain"" refers to efforts by Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, and Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont to strike a complicated, 12-bill compromise on several major topics that combine new or increased taxes to generate revenue along with business and political reforms aimed at strengthening the state economy and boosting public confidence in government. To date, such a bargain has not come to fruition.The governor’s press office referred questions about the balanced budget claims to Illinois Republican Party spokesman Steven Yaffe. Asked via email to provide the original source for the statement that the governor’s budget proposal was balanced, Yaffe said, ""As stated in his budget address, Governor Rauner's plan to balance the budget includes freezing property taxes, capping spending, paying down the debt, and term-limiting career politicians.""When asked again for the original source of that statement, Yaffe said, ""His plan to balance the budget includes these four items. That's what the advertisement is saying. These four items are keys to passing a bipartisan balanced budget plan in the General Assembly. The final plan is obviously still being negotiated, but these reforms are critical.""Despite repeated requests, Yaffe did not offer an original source but said, ""The ad is accurate.""In his speech, the governor acknowledged he expected Democrats to attack him for not proposing a balanced budget and noted the Legislature’s controlling party has not approved a balanced budget for years.""It’s not going to help us move forward if right after this speech, Democrats run to the media claiming we’ve never proposed a plan to balance the budget,"" he said. ""And it’s not going to help us move forward if Republicans run to the media to point out that the Democratic legislature’s never passed a balanced budget. People want to see us get something done – to get a balanced budget to change our broken system.""""The word ‘balanced’ seems to have become a politically malleable term. And not just with Rauner,"" he said, noting former Democratic Govs. Pat Quinn, Rod Blagojevich and others have bent the meaning. ""It is in some sense institutionalized and hidden by all the special funds. So does the proposed budget have expenditures equal to revenues in clear, concrete and plausible terms? It doesn’t look like it.""I think the term has been stretched so far by both sides of the aisles and both branches over recent years,"" Mooney added, that he would ""hardly blame"" the governor for ""playing this ongoing political word game.""Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning think tank, didn’t concern himself with rhetoric. ""The FY2018 General Fund budget proposed by Governor Rauner cannot be considered balanced by any objective standard for two reasons: first, it relies on over $1 billion in unspecified and unlikely savings from ‘pension reforms’ that are not only unlikely to pass, but if they did, would likely be ruled unconstitutional; second, and even more troubling, is the $4.572 billion in ‘savings’ the governor anticipates from ‘working together on a grand bargain’ -- which is so ambiguous that it cannot credibly be valued at all.""Our rulingGov. Rauner said he proposed a balanced budget.""Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation"" the governor told lawmakers.Yet, the budget book produced by the governor’s office of management and budget suggests the budget is balanced by ""working together on a grand bargain.""

PANTS-FIRE,NC's Dan Forest wrongly claims Gov. Roy Cooper will create 'Look But Don't Touch' bathroom policy,"After Gov. Roy Cooper introduced a proposal repealing House Bill 2, one of the law’s biggest supporters spoke up.""If Governor Cooper's proposed bill for repealing HB2 becomes law, it will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms,"" Forest said in a written statement. ""Heterosexual men will be able to access women's showers and bathrooms by simply posing as a transgender individual. They will be able to watch women and children shower, or shower next to them. As long as the man doesn't touch them, assault them or film them, no legal protection would be afforded the offended woman or child. Nothing.""That’s a shocking claim. We found it’s also not based in reality.What happens if HB2 gets repealedHis statement implies Cooper proposed letting transgender people use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. That’s not true. In reality, Cooper suggested a return to the status quo that North Carolina used for centuries, in which there were no laws about bathroom access.We asked Forest spokesman Jamey Falkenbury if Forest thought that North Carolina had a ""state-sanctioned ‘Look But Don’t Touch’ policy"" for all that time. Falkenbury said Forest was instead making the assumption that, once HB2 is repealed, cities and counties will rush to pass transgender-friendly bathroom rules.We can’t see the future, and neither can Forest, although Falkenbury did correctly point out that ""with HB2 repealed there would be no legal mechanism to block those ordinances.""Yet even if that did happen the decision is up to local governments, and the rules would only apply locally. That’s hardly a ""state-sanctioned"" policy, contrary to Forest’s claim.Law enforcement doesn’t lack powerWe looked into legal protections for two different possibilities: What powers law enforcement will have under the situation Cooper actually proposed, as well as under the situation Forest believes might happen.That first one is easy.And since HB2 contains no civil or criminal penalties for violations, repealing it wouldn’t take away any legal protections.If the sexual predators in Forest’s scenarios are also convicted sex offenders, the state has laws to give them additional punishments for re-offending, or even for simply being near places kids go – including pools, schools and other places with the kind of shared facilities Forest is worried about.And in 2015, before HB2 passed, UNC-Chapel Hill law professor Jeff Welty wrote about what could happen to people go into the wrong bathroom. Welty said there’s ""a strong argument"" for trespassing and ""a reasonable argument"" for breaking and entering.So all that debunks one of Forest's concerns, of a man watching women undress with no legal consequences if HB2 is repealed. There absolutely would be legal protections. And Forest’s more extreme scenario, of men being able to undress or shower with women, is even more ludicrous. North Carolina’s indecent exposure law would apply, and would lead to felony charges if children were present.Trying to see the futureBut what about if a city took advantage of the HB2 repeal and allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify? Let’s examine the possibilities.Falkenbury said it’s because Forest believes those laws would become meaningless. If a man claimed he was feeling like a woman at that particular moment in time, Falkenbury said, the law would be powerless to stop him.Forest can’t possibly have any North Carolina-specific proof, since nowhere in the state has ever had transgender-friendly bathroom rules (Charlotte tried to, but HB2 became law first).""If a business has a reasonable belief that a person is in the wrong place, there is no rule that states that the person cannot be questioned and required to leave,"" the commission said.The man in that situation was never charged with any crimes, but neither we nor Forest can say what might happen in a similar case in North Carolina. There’s simply no precedent here.But Forest’s more worrisome scenario, in which a man undresses or showers with women consequence-free, is clearly implausible. Even in a hypothetical North Carolina city with a transgender-friendly bathroom rule, that would absolutely be illegal.Our rulingLt. Gov. Dan Forest said that Cooper’s HB2 repeal bill, if it passes, ""will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms"" with no laws in place to protect women from predatory men.In reality, there are at least half a dozen laws protecting people from the type of scenarios Forest wrongly said would become consequence-free. Cooper even suggested creating stronger penalties for some of them.Forest defended his claim by saying cities would start letting transgender people in bathrooms of the gender with which they identify. That's not what Cooper proposed, however. And even if it does happen, it’s a local government decision, not a ""state-sanctioned"" policy. And even in that case, one of Forest’s hypothetical concerns is clearly baseless, and the other is unclear at best.We rate this claim Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Bill Gates did not compare Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan on Twitter,"A host of websites known for circulating dubious reports say that software magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates compared President Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan, but there’s no evidence that ever happened.In the last few weeks, multiple outlets shared a fake tweet allegedly from Gates making the claim, ""After 17 minuts (sic) phone call with President Trump, I think he will go down as one of the greatest presidents just like Reagan."" The tweet, shown above, is dated Jan. 22, 2017.It’s also easy to see that Gates didn’t send the tweet.

Kennedy, not Reagan.""But in the same way President Kennedy talked about the space mission and got the country behind that, I think that whether it's education or stopping epidemics, other health breakthroughs, finishing polio, and in this energy space, there can be a very upbeat message that (Trump's) administration is going to organize things, get rid of regulatory barriers, and have American leadership through innovation, be one of the things that he gets behind.""""It was a good time,"" Gates said afterward.

PANTS-FIRE,White House senior adviser repeats baseless claim about busing illegal voters in New Hampshire,"President Donald Trump won the election but he lost New Hampshire, a fact he has tried to explain by arguing that liberal voters from Massachusetts crossed into New Hampshire to cast their vote against him.""I’ve actually, having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics. It’s very real, it’s very serious,"" Miller said. ""This morning on this show is not the venue for me lay out all the evidence.""We searched widely, as have others, and failed to find any evidence corroborating Miller and Trump’s claim.Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, said the stories about voters coming over from Massachusetts are as old as ""the invention of the bus."" What fuels the concern is New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration law, even though it was adopted in the 1990s with strong Republican support to avoid the federal government’s ""motor voter law,"" which allows people to register to vote at their DMV.""The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote,"" Cullen told PolitiFact. ""Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high.""He said the same theory was going around in New Hampshire in 2012, an election where Massachusetts Democrats were supporting Elizabeth Warren against incumbent Sen. Scott Brown.Adding more fuel to the talking point is that some Massachusetts residents do go to New Hampshire to help with that state’s closer elections, said Dante Scala, a University of New Hampshire political scientist who has written books and articles about the state’s elections over 15 years.""So it certainly is possible on election day people from Massachusetts come north to work on the election itself,"" he said, ""but that’s a far cry from proving that they vote here.""Chris Sununu, who won his bid for New Hampshire governor Nov. 8, warned ahead of the election that Democrats would bus in Massachusetts voters in places where elections are not close and assign them a fake address to apply for same-day voter registration in New Hampshire.That statement, like Miller’s, was flawed. Aside from one to two cases per election, the top state elections official said widespread voter fraud is not a problem. ""I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,"" New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said in an interview with PolitiFact New Hampshire.In Sununu’s case, he eventually walked back much of his argument, saying he wasn’t talking about literal buses of voters crossing into the state; rather it was a ""figure of speech that people are coming over, they’re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave.""The incident he had in mind was, he said, of Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark letting Democratic staffers live at her house during the 2008 and 2012 elections.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, Coretta Scott King didn't thank Jeff Sessions in video clip","Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.,  died in 2006. But her opinion on the man who is now President Donald Trump’s attorney general is still being talked about today.The Senate’s decision to silence Warren energized her supporters. But it wasn’t long before conservative corners of the Internet tried to push a counter-narrative showing Coretta Scott King as favorable towards Sessions.Here’s the rest of the post, which also referenced a controversy over Warren and whether she had American Indian heritage:Well, that was quick. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s racial stunt that sparked her removal from the senate floor Tuesday night proved even shorter than her time living in a teepee.Warren attempted to use the words of Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions’ bid for Attorney General. Warren’s now warrant-less claim was that King’s wife’s words framed Sessions as a bigot.But now a more recent video has surfaced where Coretta King in fact praises Sessions at the launching of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.What a difference 12 hours can make.Several readers were curious about what the attached video showed, so we took a closer look. (True Pundit did not respond to an inquiry through its website.)Speakers at the dedication included Parks herself; Coretta Scott King; civil rights widow Juanita Jones Abernathy; civil rights leaders Johnnie Mae Carr, Dorothy Height, Evelyn Lowery, Elaine Steele, Mammie Till-Mobley; actor Cicely Tyson; and several elected and appointed officials, including Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright, Troy State-Montgomery chancellor Jack Hawkins and president Cameron Martindale, U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, and Sessions.To President Martindale, to Sen. Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms. Johnnie Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mammie Till-Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today, it's a great honor and a privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. History teaches us that all great freedom movements begin with an inspiring act of courage, and in this regard the American civil rights movement provides a supreme example. The library and museum we dedicate today is a living testament to the courage, commitment and character of the great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle, the woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks. In her extraordinary courage and humility, Mrs. Rosa Parks provided our movement with a matchless example of the very spirit of non-violence.That was the only time King mentioned Sessions in her speech -- and it her words fall well short of ""thanking"" him, whether for his role in establishing the library or for anything else. She simply acknowledged his presence in the room, as she did with other dignitaries.We checked with Jeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who is now a founding partner of West Wing Writers, which does speechwriting for a variety of clients.""This is the verbal equivalent of a wave or a handshake,"" Shesol said. ""In speechwriting, we call this the ‘acknowledgments’ section -- a list of people that you simply have to mention, in passing, given their office or stature. The sort of people who you can't risk slighting by appearing to ignore them.""Shesol said there is a separate category of salute that qualifies as a genuine thank you.""When someone needs to be singled out and thanked for their role in something, or for their contribution or leadership, that requires the speaker to pause and say something grateful and meaningful,"" he said.And King did just that later in her speech, in a portion not shown in the YouTube clip that True Pundit appended to its post. In her remarks, King specifically thanked the Montgomery Improvement Association and Troy State University for their efforts on helping establish the library and museum.""What you have here is a willful misinterpretation of a very basic gesture,"" Shesol said of the way True Pundit framed its post.Our rulingTrue Pundit said a video shows ""Coretta Scott King thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks library.""Even a cursory review of the video shows no such thing. King did acknowledge Sessions’ presence at the event, along with the presence of seven other dignitaries. But she did not go any further than mentioning his name. By contrast, she specifically thanked a local community group and the hosting university for their help in making the museum a reality.The website twists King’s actual words to a ridiculous degree, so we rate it Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrong that media is not reporting on terrorism any more,"During a visit to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, President Donald Trump took a shot at one of his favorite targets -- the media. This time, he blamed the media for letting Islamic terrorists get away with attacks without covering them.""Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino and all across Europe,"" Trump said. ""You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported, and in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.""The remark quickly inspired puzzled reactions. Is it accurate?But recent attacks on U.S. soil -- including the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, Calif., and the 2016 attacks on an Orlando nightclub, a New York City street and a college campus in Columbus, Ohio -- have received heavy media attention, often including live coverage for hours at a time and continuing coverage for days afterward.Europe, the other locale Trump mentioned, has had a number of big attacks in recent years as well, including major incidents in Paris, Brussels and the French city of Nice. These attacks have also received extensive coverage in the United States.Experts who study terrorism told PolitiFact that, in general, terrorist attacks in the United States or Europe do get covered, though the extent of the coverage can vary based on the severity of the attack and whether there are casualties.""Attacks are always reported, in my experience, somewhere,"" said Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. The exceptions, he said, may include ""failed plots, aborted plans, or bombs that failed to explode.""John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. ""There are some incidents of such trivial nature that local authorities are hard put to decide whether it is terrorism or hooliganism,"" Pike said. ""But if an American or European civilian or officer is seriously injured or killed, it gets reported.""The White House didn’t offer any elaboration, but the strongest defense of Trump’s remark came from Ted Bromund, a foreign policy specialist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.While Bromund said he doesn’t believe the media has failed to report attacks, as Trump asserted in Tampa, he added that he sees ""ample evidence that the nature of the attacks has been downplayed.""Bromund said he reads Trump’s comments -- which, he said, ""are admittedly not fully clear"" -- as being ""a statement of the obvious: Leading politicians, and many media outlets, have been very hesitant to describe terrorist attacks as being motivated by radical Islamism, very eager to come up with other explanations for those attacks, and even more hesitant to acknowledge that there is any relationship at all -- even a perverted one -- between radical Islamism and Islam itself.""Still, it’s worth noting that it’s not always clear-cut whether an attack was driven purely by religious ideology or by a combination of factors -- and law-enforcement officials aren’t always definitive, either.In the meantime, some argue that -- if anything -- terrorism inspires too much media coverage.Our rulingTrump said that terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe have ""gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.""We found no support for the idea that the media is hushing up terrorist attacks on U.S. or European soil.

It then goes on to quote Pence as saying the bill didn’t have an exception for victims of rape because ""we’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion.""To be clear, Pence never said these things. The story originated on a family of websites known for creating stories based on real events, but with made-up details in what it describes as an attempt to be funny.In this case, what Politicot.com deems as ""facts"" is limited to the opening paragraph, which noted Pence had ""recently"" signed a bill restricting abortions.We’ve acknowledged in the past that Politicot.com’s related sites don’t do a good enough job of pointing out their stories are fake, and exacerbate problems by building contrived details upon real news events.

PANTS-FIRE,Chuck Schumer wrongly tweets 'Tillerson won't divest from Exxon',"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he won’t vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as secretary of state — in part because Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, won’t divest from his former employer.That’s incorrect. Tillerson divested from Exxon, where he worked for 40 years, in early January.To Schumer’s credit, spokesman Matt House acknowledged the mistake and said his staff would correct the tweets. House said the tweets were supposed to just say Tillerson wouldn’t commit to recusing himself from issues that involve Exxon. But that’s also wrong, as we’ll explain.We still wanted to put Schumer’s claim that ""Tillerson won’t divest from Exxon"" on the Truth-O-Meter and set the record straight.Tillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and is entitled to 2 million Exxon shares paid out over 10 years — a package worth more than $170 million as of Jan. 27. However, under the ethics agreement, Exxon will pay out those shares in cash, and they will be put in an independently managed trust that will not be allowed to invest in Exxon.If Tillerson violates the agreement, he will forfeit the trust, and the money will go to a charity not chosen by Exxon or Tillerson.Walter Shaub, director of the Office on Government Ethics, gave Tillerson’s divestment plan a glowing review, calling it a ""clean break from Exxon.""In contrast, Shaub criticized President Donald Trump’s plan for severing ties with his businesses because it is not a complete divestiture.In his Brookings remarks, Shaub said he ""was glad in November when the president-elect tweeted that he wanted to, as he put it, ‘in no way have a conflict of interest’ with his businesses. Unfortunately, his current plan cannot achieve that goal. It’s easy to see that the current plan does not achieve anything like the clean break Rex Tillerson is making from Exxon.""Regarding Schumer’s claim that Tillerson hasn’t committed to recusing himself from any decisions involving Exxon, federal law requires that Tillerson, if confirmed, stay out of any such decisions for one year. That could pose problems given Exxon’s extensive international business interests.Our rulingSchumer said, ""Tillerson won't divest from Exxon.""But that’s not even close to the truth. Tillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and laid out a plan for full divestment in the following week. The director of the Office of Government Ethics called it a ""clean break from Exxon.""We rate Schumer’s claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Fake news alert: There's no bronze statue of Obama in the White House's front door,"A fake story that claimed President Barack Obama was installing a pricey statue of himself in the White House before he left office has gone bust under a smidge of scrutiny.The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s effort to limit the impact of fake news on readers’ news feeds.In the posts, Obama is quoted as praising his own record and saying he commissioned the $200,000 bronze statue (repeatedly spelled ""statute,"" as in a law or rule) to preserve his legacy. He wanted the statue ""permanently erected in the entryway of the White House,"" the article asserted.Some versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office.Clearly, the article is contrived.

PANTS-FIRE,Whoopi Goldberg wrongly says Obama waited ‘at least a couple of months’ to issue executive actions,"After a striking comment from co-host Joy Behar, who hypothesized Trump was passing executive actions quickly because he was afraid he’d be impeached, another co-host, Jedediah Bila, countered Behar’s point saying ""all presidents do this."" Goldberg offered an instant fact-check.""I think the difference in what you're saying in terms of executive action is at least it took President Obama, at least a couple of months in, and this one (Trump) has came in and he said, ‘We're doing this and this, and this.’ And I understand that,"" Goldberg said in a Jan. 25 segment of the View.Goldberg repeated this idea again in response to Bila, who criticized Obama for taking executive actions at the start of his presidency when he could have passed laws through a Democratic Congress.""But (Obama) didn’t do executive orders in the beginning,"" Goldberg said.Executive orders are the most well-known kind of presidential action, and have a long tradition in presidential history back to the days of George Washington. In fact, every president except for William Harrison (who died a month into office) has issued at least one executive order.This specific presidential action directs the federal government and bureaucracies and carries the power of the law. However, executive orders can be revoked or amended by future presidents.We wanted to settle the matter: Did Obama, unlike Trump, wait to take executive action? Long story short is that he didn’t, and experts said executive actions are common among new presidents.  Obama didn’t waste much time before issuing executive orders after his inauguration.Over the next 10 days, Obama had signed nine executive orders. By the end of his first month, the number was 16.MonthExecutive orders signed by ObamaJanuary 2009 (starting on Jan. 21)9February 20097March 20092April 20091Executive action has a broad definition, but just in terms of one type of executive orders, Goldberg’s claim is incorrect.That said, it’s hard to say whether Trump’s first actions as president are more significant for policy than Obama’s.Executive orders aren’t the only action president’s can take, making it difficult to compare Obama’s use of unilateral actions to Trump’s so far.Through ""executive actions,"" presidents can also pardon criminals, amend the internal structure of the executive branch, issue signing statements, write letters and memoranda, and more.""The number of orders is often misleading, and the terminology can be confusing — both presidents issued important orders that were not ‘Executive Orders’ with numbers attached,"" said John T. Woolley, an American politics professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that both Trump and Obama took controversial actions at the start.""The early Trump executive actions have been on hot button issues, so they aroused a lot of early controversy, but we can’t forget how controversial presidential actions of the past have been,"" he said.He added that is not unlikely for presidents to take executive actions at first, especially when there’s a change in party, adding that presidents want to reverse actions of the previous administration.The recession gripping the country when Obama took office also spurred the former president to move with more urgent executive action, Galston said.Our rulingGoldberg said Obama waited ""at least a couple of months"" to issue executive actions. That’s not correct; Obama issued an executive order on his first day in office, and 16 with in his first month.Although it’s hard to compare one president’s actions to the other, experts said Trump and Obama both issued important orders in the beginning of their presidency, which is common practice.We rate this statement Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee69d395-6457-4516-91b2-9055099e7528"

His overall assertion that Trump’s inaugural drew the ""largest audience"" ever is flat-out wrong.Infrastructure issuesSpicer pointed to changes in infrastructure that gave the illusion of low turnout.It was the ""first time"" that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the National Mall, which had highlighted empty spots in the inaugural crowd, an effect not experienced in past inaugurations, he said.Spicer also blamed the ""first time"" usage of fencing and magnetometers on the Mall for ""preventing hundreds of thousands of people being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had inaugurations past.""Crowd sizeSpicer then knocked the press for tweeting out ""inaccurate numbers involving crowd size.""""No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out,"" he said.  ""We do know a few things.

Trump already is preparing to nominate a successor for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, after Republicans in Congress for months refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland.At 83, Ginsburg is considered to be one of the justices Trump might replace, should Ginsburg retire or die while he is in office. Fueling that talk is Ginsburg’s outspoken opposition to Trump.All the fake posts read essentially the same, allegedly quoting Ginsburg in an interview about what would happen if Trump started choosing replacement Supreme Court justices.""I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,"" Ginsburg told the Associated Press, according to the posts.While Ginsburg did express distaste for Trump publicly, everything else in the fake news posts appear to be completely contrived.The posts all include lengthy faux quotes in which Ginsburg says she could not tolerate Trump as a president and would resign should he become commander in chief.

This one certainly qualifies.The story says a former agent named Paul Horner had written the book, titled The Black House: A 12-year former Secret Service agent explains why Obama and the First Lady are ruining this country.The book was ""quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts,"" according to the post. The article says that Horner confirmed the lascivious details of the book to an NBC senior political analyst named Tom Downey.Everything about the story — the book, the author, the interview and certainly the details contained therein — is fake.The absurd nature of the allegations should be a tip-off that the story is fake, although many of the commenters do not seem to understand the content is fabricated.In the make-believe interview, Horner tells Downey that Obama constantly berated Christians, forced the pretend agent to listen to Diana Ross and had staff harass a Facebook page about a masturbating dolphin.This is a fake story that has been circulating for more than a year without any indication that it is bogus.

PANTS-FIRE,Pants on Fire: Larry Pratt says Obama hasn't decried killings of police,"Larry Pratt, the longtime leader of Gun Owners of America, says President Barack Obama has been nonchalant about ambush shootings targeting police.  ""There have been officers simply gunned down because they had a uniform on,"" Pratt said during a Dec. 15 radio interview on WINA in Charlottesville. ""It’s not just Dallas, it’s other places as well and the thing that frankly concerns me as I think about this is that the president not only has not condemned this, he actually seems to have a rationale that maybe this is what you would expect in the United States with its history of slavery and racial impression and so forth.""That doesn’t help in the here and now,"" added Pratt, a Republican who represented Fairfax County in the General Assembly in the early 1980s. ""We don’t have slavery and we don’t have racial oppression, but we do have cops getting killed.""We wondered whether Pratt, whose organization is headquartered in Fairfax County and has criticized the NRA as being soft on gun rights, was correct that Obama never ""condemned"" the murders of police.

Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification.

Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.""We asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama.Pratt told us that Obama ""has stirred the pot,"" on attacking police. ""He’s looking for division.""Our rulingPratt said Obama never ""condemned"" murders targeting police.His outrageous statement ignores the president’s expressions of abhorrence following each of three different ambush murders of multiple police officers in the last two years.  Obama publicly called the killings ""vicious,"" ""reprehensible,"" ""cowardly,"" and ""despicable.""  Following the 2014 slaying of two New York policemen, Obama used the very word Pratt denies him, saying, ""I unconditionally condemn"" the murders.We rate Pratt’s claim Pants on Fire."

For the fiscal year through August 2017, $26 billion in state money was budgeted for Medicaid.News organizations have widely tracked the results of the directive to reduce Medicaid payments to certain in-home child therapists. Those accounts show that no Medicaid funding was entirely killed and also that the reductions put in motion couldn’t have been connected to the November 2016 election results without time-machine trickery.An April 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story quoted state Sen. Jane Nelson, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, saying lawmakers made the reductions based on information showing Texas’ rates had considerably exceeded Medicaid reimbursement rates in other states, a point disputed by some.Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said in 2016: ""Forcing Texas taxpayers to accept billing rates that are in some cases double the rates in other states would be a terrible precedent. These are rate adjustments, not reductions in services, and the (budget) rider clearly directs the agency to preserve access to care as we bring these rates to an appropriate level.""To our inquiry, Bill Noble, spokesman for the Texas Association for Home Care and Hospice, which opposed the fee reductions, reminded us by email that advocates for providers vigorously challenged the quality of the research behind the fee reductions.Our rulingIfYouOnlyNews.com said: ""Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities.""Cuts sure happened.

The New York City identification card gives them access to city programs and services and helps when it comes to renting an apartment, opening a bank account or complying with a police officer who asks for identification.  So which card is harder to get?State Assemblyman Ron Castorina Jr., R-Staten Island, called the vetting process for a New York City ID card weak with ""little to no integrity.""Castorina and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, also a Republican from Staten Island, want the city to hold onto the documents because they may help law enforcement agencies in any investigations.So is Castorina right? Is it easier to get a Costco membership? To find out, we went through the application process.Signing up for CostcoThe application requires your name, address, date of birth, email address and phone number. Members can share their membership with others in their households, but have to provide their name, dates of birth, and contact information as well. The online form takes less than five minutes to complete.After completing the form, applicants enter their credit card information to purchase the membership online. Membership options range from $55 to $110. Members pay to renew the membership each year.Once the payment is accepted, Costco sends an email with a membership number. This can take from 10 minutes to 24 hours, a company customer service representative said.After receiving the email, the customer copies the membership number down and brings it along on the first visit to the Costco store. Customers must bring a photo ID on their initial visit. Otherwise, the store will not hand over the membership card.Customers who opt for the business membership also have to bring either a business license or three pieces of business ID, which can include anything from a business card to an electric bill.Customers do not have to provide a proof of residency. The store’s customer service line says customers can complete the entire process in less than one day.Signing up for a New York City IDHomeless people or survivors of domestic violence who do not have a permanent address have to bring a letter from either the shelter where they are staying or from a city agency, nonprofit organization, religious institution, hospital, or health clinic.Our rulingCastorina, the assemblyman from Staten Island, claimed in a press release that ""it is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than it is to get a NYC Municipal ID.""Getting a membership at Costco requires an application and a photo ID on your first visit to the store.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump claims 'serious voter fraud' in New Hampshire,"Two weeks after winning the 2016 election, President-elect Donald Trump is back on the voter fraud attack -- claiming millions of people voted illegally, thereby robbing him of the popular vote.On Sunday night, Trump unleashed a barrage of tweets claiming - without evidence - that he would have won the nation’s popular vote ""if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" By the latest tally, Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton won the country’s popular vote by more than 2 million votes, but lost the Electoral College contest that decides the election.Trump followed up with a second tweet alleging ""serious voter fraud"" in Virginia, California and New Hampshire, three states that voted for Clinton on Nov. 8.Voter fraud in N.H.?To get right to the point, top election officials in the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office, New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office and U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Hampshire all said they have received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election.On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump’s office has offered any evidence of ""serious voter fraud"" in New Hampshire.While New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale.In New Hampshire, the attorney general’s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases, one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints since 2012, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said.Buonamano told the Associated Press he has no evidence to back up Trump’s claims. Buonamano said his office is looking into fewer than five complaints that involve possible voter fraud since 2012 and none so far this election. (He didn’t provide an exact number.)About 729,000 people voted on Nov. 8 in New Hampshire, according to the Secretary of State’s office.Historically, instances of voter fraud-- even allegations -- have been scant in New Hampshire, according to Secretary of State Bill Gardner, the state’s top election officer.""I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,"" Gardner said earlier this month.State law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don’t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State’s office will send out confirmation letters to those people to check their identities.""If you’re someone who shouldn’t be voting, you’re probably not going to want your picture taken,"" Gardner said in an interview Monday. ""We’ve done a lot to protect the integrity of the election process.""Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zuckerman said his office received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. Zuckerman has served as the district elections officer in New Hampshire for the last 10 years.""Local election officials, from what I can see, take their responsibility very seriously and undertake to run as transparent and trouble free elections as they can,"" Zuckerman said. ""We haven’t seen those incidents occur.""Eyes on the pollsBecause of speculation of voter fraud leading up to the election, both Republicans and Democrats employed volunteer poll watchers to monitor the voting process.One of those watchers was Chip Fagan, a Willis, Mass. resident who volunteered to observe the polls in the town of Bow for the New Hampshire Republican Party on election day.""Everything here is pretty well organized,"" Fagan said on Nov. 8. ""They’ve got backup systems for backup systems. They’re really well organized, from the traffic direction to the set up. We want to make sure everyone has the chance to vote.""Nashua City Clerk Tricia Piecuch said she noticed nothing out of the ordinary on Election Day in the state’s second largest city, located on the border with Massachusetts. Though the lines were long, she said, things ran smoothly.""We did not receive any reports of any issues,"" Piecuch said. ""The hype with this election is you always are prepared for the worst and hope for the best. We were prepared.""Piecuch said she had learned the news of Trump’s tweet on a thread with other local election officials in New Hampshire, who were talking about the president-elect’s latest allegation.""They would like to see the proof,"" Piecuch said.New Hampshire receives so few election complaints that the Attorney General’s Office currently has one part-time attorney dedicated to them. But that doesn’t mean they’re all dealt with swiftly. The office recently asked for more money to fund an additional employee to help investigate a backlog of about 50 election-law complaint investigations that are still open. Some date back to 2012.Trump’s claim is similar to one made by Governor-elect Chris Sununu in the final weeks of the November election. He claimed New Hampshire Democrats were rigging elections by busing in Massachusetts residents to vote on election day.Our ratingTrump claimed ""serious voter fraud"" existed in New Hampshire and two other states on election day, Nov. 8.Those in charge of overseeing New Hampshire’s elections and investigating election complaints said any instances of voter fraud in the state have historically been extremely rare.

If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. But as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades.""Padilla’s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it’s received for this and past general elections.Hillary Clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over Trump as of Nov. 28, a margin that’s grown substantially as California continues to count the state’s many absentee ballots.'Broad brush allegations'Dean Logan, president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and the top elections official in Los Angeles County, said in a statement responding to Trump’s tweets, that the state has ""a history of accurate and accountable elections.""Logan described Trump’s voter fraud claims as ""broad brush allegations.""Logan added in an email to PolitiFact California that: ""Quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track.  That alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other.""He added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter’s eligibility. But none were used before or after the election, he said.""And I think that sort of goes to the point that there’s nothing to back up those allegations,"" Logan said.Sacramento County’s Assistant Registrar of Voters Alice Jarboe said of the more than 530,000 county voters that turned out on Election Day, none has made a complaint about voter fraud.Jarboe, who’s worked at the department for 18 years, said no complaints are ""the norm"" for elections in her county.""I’ve never seen anything (related to voter fraud) that would affect the outcome of an election -- ever,"" she added.Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit voter advocacy group, said she’s not seen evidence of serious voter fraud.""No system is perfect -- people do make mistakes,"" Alexander said.She added, however, that California’s voter verification laws are among the most robust in the country. Each county, she noted, is automatically required to perform a recount a fraction of its ballots by hand.The state also prohibits paperless electronic voting, a type of voting that makes audits nearly impossible, she said.Our rulingDonald Trump claimed ""serious voter fraud"" took place on Election Day in California. He offered no evidence backing up his statement and his press team did not respond specifically to a request about fraud in the state.Elections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said there were no widespread reports of voter fraud.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that millions of illegal votes cost him popular vote victory,"President-elect Donald Trump provoked a firestorm on social media with a series of tweets on Nov. 27 that questioned the integrity of the balloting that elected him president.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegallyWe found zero evidence for Trump’s charge that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,"" and a lot of reasons to conclude that it didn’t happen.The current status of the voteAlmost three weeks after Election Day, the ballots are mostly — but not entirely — counted.So to erase Trump’s popular-vote deficit, there would need to be almost 3 million votes for Clinton that were cast illegally. And that assumes that all 3 million of these ""illegal votes"" went to Clinton and not a single one went to Trump.That’s a really big number. For a sense of scale, 3 million votes is more than were cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. And 3 million people is more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States — a group that InfoWars specifically singled out as the source of 3 million illegal votes.A lack of evidencePhillips has not responded to PolitiFact’s queries for additional information.

Phillips would not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he would release the information publicly once he is finished.Voter fraud uncommonOther research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread.Experts unconvincedExperts dismissed the substance of Trump’s tweet.""This is patently false,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. ""There would need to be a massive national conspiracy and coordination effort to do this, and illegal aliens would need to be on the voter rolls in states across the country months earlier to be eligible to vote. It is also very convenient the estimated fraudulent vote is just enough to give Trump the popular vote. Not likely a coincidence.""Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz added, ""If Mr. Trump seriously believes that there was significant vote fraud in any state, he should file a formal protest and ask for an investigation. He does not — he is simply repeating baseless claims.""And University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said the claim is short on basic logic.""It’s bizarre to claim that Clinton had the ability to generate millions of illegal voters but not use them to help her win the Electoral College,"" Masket said.Our rulingTrump tweeted that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.""Neither Trump nor his allies have presented any evidence of widespread illegal voting. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is nowhere near common enough to call into question millions and millions of votes.Indeed, the ability to carry off such a far-reaching conspiracy — potentially involving millions of people over the course of several months and without being noticed by election administration officials, many of them in states controlled by Republicans — is ridiculously illogical.

PANTS-FIRE,"Pat Robertson absurdly says Sanger, King conspired in black genocide","Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson recently said that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. partnered in a conspiracy to promote black genocide.Robertson made the statement on the Nov. 8 broadcast of ""The 700 Club,"" his long-running television show that airs from Virginia Beach. It came during his interview of Wellington Boone, a black Christian minister and author from Duluth, Ga., who shares many of Robertson’s socially conservative views.Both men are unrelenting critics of Planned Parenthood, a woman’s health care organization that is the largest single abortion provider in the U.S.Boone, during his interview with Robertson, accused Planned Parenthood of being in cahoots with ""the left"" in a plan to slow black birthrates. That’s when Robertson weighed in with his comment on Sanger and King. Let’s unpack it.SangerIn 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League to distribute contraceptives and promote their use. The organization changed its name to Planned Parenthood in 1942.Robertson and Boone are hardly first to accuse Sanger of espousing black genocide.The charge initially was made by some African-Americans in the early 1930s who distrusted the efforts by Sanger, who was white, to set up a birth control clinic in their Harlem neighborhood, according to Jean Baker, a Goucher College professor and author of the biography ""Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion.""Baker, in an email, told us Sanger’s motives at the time were misunderstood and that Sanger was ""far ahead of her time in opposing segregation"" and ""saw birth control as a solution to black poverty.""Baker added, ""... to not offer clinics to blacks would have been a racist action by a woman who promoted contraception for every woman.""""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members,"" Sanger wrote.Baker told us it’s a ""far stretch"" to interpret those words as evidence of a conspiracy to eliminate blacks. She said that Sanger, sensitive to the criticism she had received in Harlem, concluded that if she was to ease suspicions about her goals in the South - during a time of lynchings and segregation - it was essential to teach black ministers and physicians about birth control and convince them to encourage it.It should be noted that Sanger enlisted two prominent black civil rights leaders to serve on the advisory board of The Negro Project: W.E.B. DuBois and Mary Bethune. It’s hard to imagine either would have joined an effort to exterminate blacks.That brings us to another civil rights leader.KingRobertson, you’ll remember, also said that King was the black minister who was chosen to be ""spokesman"" for Sanger’s efforts. Chris Roslin, a spokesman for Robertson, says the claim is based on a 1966 event.""There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist – a nonviolent resister.""In other words, King did not regard Sanger as a racist.Sanger, who was suffering from congestive heart failure, did not attend the event. She died four months later.It should be noted that Planned Parenthood started providing abortions in 1970, four years after Sanger’s death, according to Katherine Lozada, a spokeswoman for the organization. They were offered by the chapter in Syracuse, N.Y., after the repeal of a state law that criminalized abortion.Planned Parenthood’s role as an abortion provider took off after the U.S. Supreme Court, in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision, ruled that women have a right to abortions.Baker told us that ""in time, she became upset by the rise in incidence of illegal abortion and pushed the idea of staff physicians administering pregnancy tests and referring pregnant women to hospitals for ‘therapeutic’ abortions.""Sanger's ideas were changing, but she was always sensitive to the idea because she believed that birth control could effectively prevent conception, and abortion would be unnecessary,"" Baker said.Our rulingRobertson said that Sanger ""wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman.""His statement twists a sentence Sanger wrote in a 1939 letter - discussing the need to seek the support of black ministers in a program to promote birth control in the South - into a murderous conspiracy.His claim that King became the spokesman for the effort is just as preposterous and rests on a 1966 award the civil rights leader received from Planned Parenthood for his support of family planning.We rate Robertson’s incendiary statement Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/081fdb98-3c13-43c4-b862-e4a9fc9651ec"

PANTS-FIRE,Republican candidate for governor Chris Sununu says Mass. voters bused across border to vote in NH,"Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu became the latest politician to question the integrity of the voting process this week.As a guest on the Howie Carr Show on Monday, Sununu responded to a question about New Hampshire’s long run of Democratic governors by accusing New Hampshire Democrats of changing election laws and participating in voter fraud using same-day registration.""The Democrats are very sly,"" Sununu said, before saying state Democrats changed election laws in the late 1990s or early 2000s to accommodate same-day voter registration. He then alleged that when elections in neighboring Massachusetts are not close, Democrats are ""busing them in all over the place"" and picking a phony address for people to use for same-day registration.""There’s no doubt there’s election fraud,"" he said. ""I don’t want to use ‘rigged’ -- that’s the word you’re not supposed to use anymore -- but they have really gamed the system to their advantage.""At a time when many people, including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are warning about ""rigged elections"" well before the votes are counted, we thought we’d check whether Sununu’s allegation was accurate.We found that while New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale, the state’s top election official says. And crucially for Sununu’s charge, he was unable to produce any evidence of buses of out-of-state voters coming into the state.""In every election since 2000, there’s been someone prosecuted for election fraud,"" said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Some out-of-state residents have voted in the state’s elections, while others have been New Hampshire residents voting in more than one town.Since 2012, the attorney general’s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases and one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said.Gardner emphasized that fraud has not proven to be a widespread problem.""I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,"" he said. Gardner said he used to have more qualms about out-of-state voters sneaking past election workers, but the state’s Voter ID law has reassured him.The law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don’t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State’s office will send out confirmation letters to those people.""I said that three or four years ago; I wouldn’t say that now based on the safeguards that we have included in the process,"" he said.Sununu walked back his comments on Tuesday.""No, I don’t want to imply I see buses coming over,"" he said, when asked if he could name a specific instance of Democrats busing voters in to vote in New Hampshire elections. ""It’s more a figure of speech that people are coming over, they’re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave.""Sununu said he was referring to an incident over Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark allowing Democratic staffers to live at her house in the 2008 and 2012 elections. Those staffers voted in New Hampshire elections using Fuller Clark’s address, which is not illegal, as they were living in the state at least 3 months before the election, the Attorney General later ruled.Sununu said he would like to tighten the state’s election laws to ""make sure that our votes, the true residents of NH are not being diluted by out of staters.""We should also note that Sununu’s point about same-day registration being passed by Democrats was also incorrect. The same-day registration law was signed by Republican Gov. Steve Merrill in 1994.Gardner said Republicans at the time were far more supportive of same-day registration, which they saw as a preferable local alternative to the federal ""Motor Voter"" law that required state governments to offer voter registration opportunities when they applied for a driver’s license.Our rulingSununu said Democrats take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration laws to bus voters in from out of state.While New Hampshire has experienced instances of voter fraud, the state’s top election official says they have been isolated and amount to one or two cases a year.More to the point, neither Sununu nor election officials could point to any instances of Massachusetts residents being bused across the border to vote on election day. The one piece of evidence Sununu pointed to was an instance of staffers of a Democratic politician registering to vote at the politician’s home -- but that practice was legal, and it did not involve Massachusetts residents being bused across the border en masse on Election Day.Sununu’s claim is ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire."

But a meeting directly with a presidential candidate would be unusual. Broward has about 600,000 Democratic voters — the highest number in Florida — so it is a key county for Clinton.We found no evidence that such a meeting took place — because it didn’t.Within days, Stone retracted his claim. (A retraction doesn’t allow a political figure to avoid the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain what he initially said and then his latest explanation.)No meetingIn an Oct. 27 interview, Snipes told us she hadn’t met with Clinton.""She has not requested a meeting from me,"" Snipes said. ""I haven’t met with anybody and neither has my staff.  I don’t even know who the members of her staff are. Neither I nor my staff met with Hillary Clinton.""When we spoke to Stone on Oct. 28, he explained how he heard the allegation -- third-hand. He lacked even the most basic details, such as where this alleged meeting took place.He said information came from a coordinator for Citizens for Trump, a grassroots group. Stone said that the coordinator told him he spoke with two women from Citizens for Trump. The women said that they saw Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes.""They claim they were inadvertently in a secured area of a presidential candidate visit,"" when they spotted Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. ""Both admit they ran, they left the place in a hurry because they were shooed off by security.""The women tried to take photos and video while they were dashing away, Stone said. The photos didn’t show anything, and Stone said he is waiting for video.""If Snipes denies it and there is no evidence to the contrary, I can say this is an incorrect report, but I’m not ready to conclude that yet,"" Stone said.After giving Stone a few more days to track down information, we circled back with him Oct. 31. That’s when he retracted his story -- or rather moved his story to a different county.""I was incorrect about that,"" he said on the radio show. ""In fact, I was off by a county. The Clinton entourage pulled up behind the West Palm Beach office of the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. Hillary Clinton was physically seen by at least three witnesses meeting with officials from the building. These observers were shooed away. ...

Stone said that Snipes announced that the amendment ""isn’t going to be on the ballot in Broward County because of some kind of a screw up.""That’s an exaggeration. The amendment is on the ballot in Broward, but four absentee ballots so far have turned up missing the amendment.Our rulingStone said Clinton showed up in Broward County and slipped into a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes.Stone was wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,N.C. legislator accuses opponent of creating a non-existent tax increase,"Chris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, took a pretty standard tactic of accusing his Democratic opponent of having raised taxes in a recent mailer.""Terence Everitt raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!"" declares the mailer, sent to homes in the area. ""That’s right. As a member of the Wake County Transit Advisory Committee, Everitt engineered a $78.5 million tax increase. Not one cent of his tax increase will even go to our schools! We can’t trust Terence Everitt!""Everitt has never held elected office before, so we were intrigued by the claim that he ""raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!""Local government 101There are multiple problems with the mailer’s accusation.The biggest is that the $78.5 million tax increase it references doesn’t actually exist.State law since 2007 has allowed a handful of North Carolina’s largest counties to raise sales taxes by half a cent to fund mass transit programs. The Wake County Board of Commissioners decided it wanted to use the option, so it asked for volunteers to study transit plans.Everitt was one of 72 people who ended up on the Wake Transit Advisory Committee. The county commissioners liked the committee’s plan, so they decided to let the county’s nearly 700,000 registered voters choose at the ballot box whether it’s worth a sales tax increase.Malone did not respond to our request for comment.The number Malone cited is right, for what it’s worth. If the bond does pass, it will raise the county’s sales tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.25 percent. County estimates show that will bring in an estimated $78.5 million in its first year.If it passes, Wake County residents will pay an additional 50 cents on every $100 in goods they purchase.But wait…there’s moreWe should also note the irony of Malone attacking an opponent for increasing sales taxes on school supplies.One part of the new tax law was eliminating North Carolina’s tax-free, back-to-school-shopping weekend after 2013. From 2002 until that change, families shopping for school supplies such as clothes, laptops and binders could go to stores across the state on one particular weekend and pay no sales taxes.Malone wasn’t in office when the legislature created the tax-free weekend. In 2013, he voted for the bill that eliminated it.So if anyone in this race could be said to have raised taxes on clothing and school supplies, it would be Malone – not Everitt.Our rulingChris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, said his Democratic challenger Terence Everitt ""raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!""That’s not true. No one has raised these taxes, including Everitt. There will be a vote on whether to raise them, but it hasn’t happened yet.This doozy of a mailer is dishonest in multiple ways.

PANTS-FIRE,GOP Attorney General candidate can’t back up claim of widespread illegal voting in PA,"Correction appendedSomehow, we’re still talking about whether or not voter fraud is widespread in Pennsylvania. And once again, we’ll repeat: Most studies and experts say it’s not.During a debate televised on 6ABC on Oct. 16, Republican candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general and state Sen. John Rafferty was in the process of bolstering his calls for a statewide voter ID provision when he implied ""illegal"" voting in Pennsylvania is widespread.""Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth,"" he said during the debate. His opponent, Democratic candidate and Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro, shot back ""That’s just simply not true"" to which Rafferty responded: ""Read the papers.""Concerns about voter fraud and illegal voting in Pennsylvania have been a major concern this election, especially as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has circulated factually inaccurate claims about voter fraud in Philadelphia. So we decided to check Rafferty’s claim.The story cited Carol Aichele, Pennsylvania’s former Secretary of State and a proponent of the implementation of voter ID laws. (She oversaw its passage in Pennsylvania and testified in the trial that ultimately led to the state Supreme Court ruling the measure unconstitutional.) At the time, Aichele told the newspaper that more than 700 Pennsylvania voters had the ""potential"" to cast two ballots in the election.""These cases are extremely rare — not because such documentation is hard to come by (many states require that such documents be retained), but because actual double voting is itself extremely rare,"" author Justin Levitt wrote in the report. ""Moreover, the scarcity is expected, given the severity of the penalty (criminal prosecution), and the meager nature of the payoff (one incremental vote).""Our RulingDuring a 6ABC debate, candidate for attorney general John Rafferty said ""Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth.""To back up that claim, the campaign provided three citations: One of which was 22 years old and not recent, one that was related to instances of voter fraud that netted an additional two votes and one that suggested about 700 voters had the ""potential"" to vote twice, but there wasn’t evidence those individuals actually did. Those do not add up to the media ""recently"" reporting on ""thousands"" of instances of illegal voting.We rate the claim Pants on Fire.This article was corrected to reflect that in the 2012 general election 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.01 percent of the vote."
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump absurdly claims Clinton campaign chairman rigged the polls. Pants on Fire!,"According to him, it’s because the Hillary Clinton campaign tampered with them.""Wikileaks also shows how (Clinton campaign chairman) John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique,"" Trump said at a Oct. 24 rally in St. Augustine, Fla. ""And that’s happening to me all the time. When the polls are even, when they leave them alone and do them properly, I’m leading. But you see these polls, where they’re polling Democrats -- ‘how’s Trump doing’ ‘oh he’s down’ -- they’re polling Democrats!""We were curious about Trump’s charge of bogus polling.Trump is wrong that Wikileaks shows Podesta rigging the polls against him. He’s referring to an email obtained by the hacker group from Clinton’s 2008 (not 2016) campaign on what appears to be internal polling (not public ones published by media organizations). And oversampling in this instance means polling more people in a specific demographic group for analysis -- not ignoring Republican voters to suppress their votes.In short, oversampling is a common polling technique and not, as Trump says, one of ""voter suppression."" Atlas sent over 98 pages of polling and media recommendations that includes several recommendations to oversample minorities, independent voters and Democrats in certain states.Experts told us the technical term for this is ""stratified disproportionate sampling,"" but most pollsters use ""oversample"" as a shorthand. It’s done not to skew the polls, but to gauge the attitudes of specific demographic groups, who would not be a statistically large enough group to analyze if sampled randomly.For example, in a national sample of 1,000 eligible voters, only 12.5 percent, or 125, would be black. To accurately gauge black attitudes on certain issues, a pollster may oversample 500 black eligible voters (four times more than the random sample). Then, in analyzing the full sample, the sample of blacks would be assigned a weight of 0.25 to represent the overall population.""If the analysis of the group is done separately, it is simply a large sample of that group. If combined with all respondents the oversample is weighted down proportionately so that the overall sample is representative of the population as a whole,"" said Charles Franklin, the director of Marquette Law School Poll. ""This is a standard procedure and does not mean the weighted sample gives disproportionate weight to the oversampled group.""Roger Tourangeau, president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, pointed out that monthly federal surveys on unemployment do the same. To get an accurate understanding of joblessness in Wyoming, pollsters would need to call a number of Wyoming residents disportionate to the number of people in the entire country.Trump’s overall charges of skewed polls is ""nonsense,"" Tourangeau said, ""Nobody wants to produce a biased assessment and look like an idiot (on Election Day). Why would people deliberately get it wrong? It’s business suicide.""Our rulingTrump said, ""Wikileaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique.""A leaked email shows the Clinton campaign of 2008 consulted data firm that suggest oversampling in what is likely internal polling.

The alert found that paperwork for various contracts was mismanaged. These contracts were together worth about $6 billion. The money didn’t go missing; the paperwork did.""Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,"" he wrote. ""Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — ‘creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the department’s contract actions.’ ""In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It’s akin to failing to get a receipt for your $20 lunch. Documentation over where that $20 went is gone, but not the $20 itself.For example, the inspector general alert notes that an audit of the Bureau of African Affairs found that the office was unable to provide full administrative files for eight separate contracts, valued at a combined $34.8 million.So the State Department under Clinton may have been financially disorganized and, according to the alert, opening itself up to fraud.

The mailer states: ""When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China. She wanted taxpayers to pay the bill for her airfare, lodging, transportation and food.""The mailer clearly gives the impression that not only did Zenzinger vote to take a taxpayer-funded trip, but she went on the trip to China, too. In a mailer photograph, the group inserted a traditional Vietnamese bamboo hat on Zenzinger’s head with a Chinese rooftop in the background.""This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly,"" Zenzinger told Denver7 and PolitiFact. ""The reason I'm filing the complaint is that I believe that they actually have crossed the line to where this is criminal. It's not even a stretching of the truth. It's just not the truth, and it's being used to influence voters.""""That needs to stop,"" she added.We reached out to Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government but hadn’t received a reply.PolitiFact rated the mailer Pants on Fire, its worst rating reserved for ridiculous statements.There are key problems with these attacks.While on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China.In April 2013, Zenzinger was a newly appointed Arvada City Councilwoman who took part in a motion regarding a sister city agreement with the Chinese city of Jinzhou.The council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Jinzhou to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition.A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo.Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip.The mayor said ""since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it,"" according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded.Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3.Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, no taxpayer money would be used. ""Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified ... that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation,"" according to the minutes.Her motion passed 5-2.Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found.Our rulingIn a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, ""When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China.""As of a council member, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. But not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China, but she never even went to China.The attack is a brazen, repeated distortion of the facts.

PANTS-FIRE,Trump wrongfully says immigrants voting illegally won North Carolina for Obama in 2008,"In his ongoing mission to claim that the presidential election is being rigged against him, Donald Trump said there have been real-world instances of stolen elections.""It’s possible that non-citizen voters were responsible for Obama’s 2008 victory in North Carolina,"" Trump said.North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes hardly would have made 2008 Republican nominee John McCain the president – Obama won 365 votes in the Electoral College to McCain’s 173.But this claim of an illegitimate victory is still a pretty shocking accusation coming from the current Republican nominee.We wondered if it could be true. Could illegally cast ballots have handed North Carolina to Obama in 2008?Evidence of illegal voting?Elections expert Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at UC-Irvine, said Trump is wrong.""I don’t think it’s possible,"" said Hasen, who runs the ElectionLawBlog.org website.But what do Trump and his campaign say about the statement?""I don’t think it’s irresponsible,"" Clovis said. ""I think it raises an issue.""That issue, he said, is some states have made it easier for immigrants living here illegally to get driver’s licenses – and, he said, that makes it easier for them to vote. However, North Carolina does not allow such immigrants to get licenses at all, so it’s unclear why Clovis brought that up.In it, two political science professors said they had studied how often immigrants – here legally or illegally – might vote in U.S. elections.Trump quoted from their study almost verbatim in his speech, although he did not mention that there are serious concerns over its validity.Significant statistical errors?The original study’s authors have defended their work, but we have to ask: Is Trump citing a debunked study?The CCES furthermore said that it wasn’t specifically surveying non-citizen voting habits, so it didn’t correct for errors in that portion of its survey – and that it believed 16 or 17 percent of the respondents mistakenly reported they were non-citizens, either because they were confused or simply clicked the wrong box on the online survey.Among the 339 supposedly non-citizen respondents, 38 (11.3 percent) said they voted. The researchers in the study that Trump cited were unable to confirm 33 of those votes, leaving them with five verified votes (1.5 percent).Like the political scientists who have called this study into question, we have a hard time using five (or even 38) anecdotes to extrapolate a scenario for the entire country, involving millions of people. But for the sake of argument, we’ll put that apprehension aside and look at the data.There were approximately 650,000 immigrants in North Carolina in 2008, about a quarter of whom were citizens. That means there were approximately 487,500 non-citizen immigrants. Surely they weren’t all adults, but let’s pretend they were.If 1.5 percent of them voted, that would mean 7,313 non-citizens voted in North Carolina in 2008. Obama won the state by about 14,000 votes, so even if every single one of them had voted for Obama, their illegal voting would not have been enough to sway the election.So even using the widely criticized study’s findings, in order to come up with a result that influenced the election you would have to: 1. Double their verified rate of voting, 2. Assume that no immigrants are under the age of 18, and 3. Assume that McCain received 0 percent of the non-citizen vote.Actual allegations in North Carolina are few and far betweenWe also checked with the N.C. Board of Elections, which said in a statement: ""We have no indication that thousands of non-citizens voted in the 2008 elections, and we don’t believe that amount of potential voter fraud would have gone unnoticed or unchallenged.""In 2008, North Carolina reported 23 allegations of non-residents either voting or registering to vote. Elections board spokesman Pat Gannon said while the office currently tracks such allegations after referring them to the courts, it did not in 2008, so it’s unclear how many of those 23 reported cases were actually illegal.Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop University, said the 23 allegations could include immigrants (legal residents as well as those living here illegally) as well as U.S. citizens from other states. He also that, in general, it would make no sense for an immigrant living in the U.S. illegally to try to vote.""Would any rational person put themselves in jeopardy of being deported for the virtual zero probability of influencing an election?"" Huffmon said.Our ruling Trump said ""it’s possible"" that Obama won North Carolina in 2008 because of non-citizens voting illegally.There is no evidence to support that theory, and that’s not for a lack of attention. A federal appeals court has looked into it, as has the N.C. Board of Elections, and both found nothing of concern. Political scientists also disagree with Trump. And even if the study Trump was citing is valid – although many say it's not – it still doesn’t back up Trump's claim.We rate this claim Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/96c8274a-cbbd-4be5-b9dd-1afe2d6d2e19"
PANTS-FIRE,"They both like expensive jets, but Creflo Dollar did not endorse Donald Trump","Well, they both like expensive jets.A new round of reports blazed across the internet again recently with this unlikely premise: Flamboyant Pastor Creflo Dollar of metro Atlanta -- who once tried to raise $65 million from his flock to buy a top-of-the-line Gulfstream  jet -- has endorsed Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump.The reports first surfaced a month or so back, died down and reignited recently as the campaign rhetoric between forces backing Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, well, escalated. Several readers have asked PolitiFact Georgia to take a look.We did, and what we got was an education on how misinformation -- or just plain made-up ""news"" --  is spread loud, and, like Jason in the ""Halloween"" movies,  comes howling back to life even after it is disproven.Dollar is an internationally known American televangelist and pastor of the nondenominational World Changers Church International, which is based in College Park, a suburb south of Atlanta.A year or so back, Dollar and other leaders at World Changers Church International launched Project G650. The goal: Raise nearly $65 million for a  luxury jet, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful.One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods to other parts of the world. Trouble is, the plane is designed to carry billionaires and their golf clubs, not large quantities of relief supplies.That food/relief argument never got off the runway, and PolitiFact Georgia gave Dollar a Pants on Fire rating.As PolitiFact quickly discovered, the Dollar-endorses-Trump rumor also crashes and burns.This time around, Dollar was the target of a satirical online site The Biz Standard News (as in BS News), which first ""reported"" in late May that Dollar was endorsing Trump.This is how the Standard defines its own site: ""The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.""The Standard piece quoted the pastor as saying: ""God came to me in a dream last night and said that Trump is his chosen candidate. God apologized for the mixed messages he was sending. I now know that Trump has been touched by the hand of God.""The piece also had Dollar comparing Trump to the biblical figure John the Baptist.The initial piece of satire received little attention. But then a legitimate online news site,  WordOnDaStreet.com, mistook this fake story as real news and two months ago rehashed the article on its website.It was quickly picked up by numerous other media outlets and went viral.Soon, there were YouTube videos -- all fake -- purporting to show Dollar’s support for Trump.Dollar, meanwhile, refuted the reports, writing on his Facebook site Aug. 25 that he has endorsed no one in the race for president.The post stated: ""At World Changers Church International, I nor the ministry endorse any political party or candidate; nor do we advise our members who to vote for. Any reports stating that I have endorsed Donald Trump for President are false. I have not endorsed any candidate and do not plan to.""Snopes.com, the site known for sniffing out bogus reports, also looked at theDollar-Trump endorsement and found it to be flatly false.Our rulingSocial media sites have buzzed with the ""news"" that metro Atlanta Pastor Creflo Dollar has endorsed Trump.Those reports are based on a satirical news site.

PANTS-FIRE,Clinton twists Trump's words on rescuing the auto industry during recession,"Donald Trump didn’t care about rescuing the auto industry during the 2008 recession, Hillary Clinton said at a rally in Michigan.Clinton told her audience at Wayne State University in Detroit that she supported the 2008 government bailout for the American auto industry, which was faltering during the financial crisis. But Trump, she said, doesn’t support American workers, much less those in Michigan’s auto industry.""Nobody should be surprised, because back in the Great Recession, when millions of jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much,"" Clinton said at the Oct. 10 rally. ""He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ Now, I can’t imagine that. I supported President (Barack) Obama’s decision to rescue the auto industry in America.""Actually, Trump's public comments about the auto industry's demise were the opposite of what Clinton said. He called for saving it.In December 2008, when Congress and then-President George W. Bush were debating giving the auto industry a bailout, Trump gave several interviews in which he stressed the importance of saving the Big Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.While he might have clashed with Bush and Obama on exact particulars of how to solve the auto crisis, Trump consistently said the auto industry needed to be saved:Clinton also quoted Trump saying ""let it go,"" referring to the auto industry. Clinton’s phrasing makes it sound like Trump said that quote during the recession. But he actually said it in 2015. And Clinton took the comment out of context.So six years after the $80 billion bailout began, Trump has maintained his ambiguous position. He said either a bailout or just bankruptcy would have been fine. But his message was not firmly, as Clinton implied, that the country should have left the auto industry out to dry.Our rulingClinton said, ""Back in the Great Recession, when millions of  jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much. He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ ""Trump is documented as saying just the opposite during the recession. He regularly said the auto industry needed saving amid a low point for manufacturers in December 2008. He said the government should stand behind the auto industry ""100 percent.""Clinton also takes the ""let it go"" quote out of context and time. Trump made that comment in 2015, not 2008.

PANTS-FIRE,Rubio: 'Not even Tim Kaine is willing' to say he trusts Hillary Clinton,"Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said Democrat U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy is in ""rare company"" by fully trusting Hillary Clinton.The U.S. Senate candidates relentlessly attacked the other’s presidential party nominee at the U.S. Senate debate Oct. 17 in Orlando. After Murphy explained to the audience why he supports Clinton, Rubio fired back with an unsubstantiated claim about U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee.His line got a few laughs, but a quick search of articles and transcripts refutes his point.‘I trust Hillary Clinton with our son’s life’Kaine accepted his party’s nomination to be vice president on July 27 during the Democratic National Convention, less than a week after Clinton announced him as her choice. In his speech, the Virginia senator and former Virginia governor vouched for Clinton’s character and urged voters to trust her.Kaine pointed to Clinton’s longtime work helping kids and families through her work on the Children’s Defense Fund, and added, ""And on a personal level, as (Nat) is serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son’s life.""""We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life,"" Kaine said. ""We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander in chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death.""With all of this talk about trust, we wondered what Rubio was talking about. His campaign sent PolitiFact Florida a news release exploring Kaine’s comments regarding Clinton’s trustworthiness, pointing to Kaine’s interview ABC’s The View in October.""During an appearance on The View, Tim Kaine would not say that Hillary Clinton is trustworthy when asked about ‘voters that have doubted her on the trust issues,’ reads the release.""And we've seen that one of the issues that she's struggled with is this issue of trust. Does this support that?"" The View co-host Jedediah Bila asked Kaine. ""Or what do you say to voters that have doubted her on the trust issues and now see these things coming through via Wikileaks?""Kaine told the audience that the Russian government was behind the Wikileaks, adding that ""you can't automatically assume that everything in all of these documents are even real."" He then went on to defend Clinton’s character, referencing her fight for health insurance for low-income children.""Hillary Clinton has a passion from the time she was a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago,"" Kaine said. ""Under the influence of this great guy named Don Jones, her passion has been empowering families and kids.""Our rulingRubio said that ""not even Tim Kaine"" is willing to say that he trusts Hillary Clinton.This is wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim of 'large scale voter fraud',"Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!Voter fraud is rare. Trump talking about it is not.Voter fraud isn’t a catch-all term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud is rare and refers to illegal interference in voting, such as ballot stuffing, voter impersonation or vote buying.For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license.For double or triple voting to sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake IDs (in many states) or forge their signatures — plus commit to committing perjury the entire time.So there is no evidence of a massive attempt to rig the election on and before Election Day.Collusion confusionTrump elaborated on his voter fraud theory a few hours after his initial tweet.His follow-up is not evidence of large-scale voter fraud, though it does bring up a separate concern revealed by Wikileaks.""Here’s one that worries me about HRC,"" Brazile wrote to Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri on March 12, 2016.

He said he supports the idea of bilateral agreements, saying that such deals would make it possible for the United States to threaten to withdraw, then renegotiate on more favorable terms before the agreement expired.Trump’s statement sounded wrong to us.

PANTS-FIRE,"Cloonen says her GOP opponent wants to strip seniors of their Social Security, Medicare benefits","Few local legislative races in Illinois are as hotly contested as the one in the 79th District between incumbent state Rep. Kate Cloonen, D-Kankakee, and her Republican challenger Lindsay Parkhurst.In a Sept. 21 campaign ad posted on Cloonen’s Facebook page, she claimed, ""Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes.""Since state lawmakers play no role in these federal programs, we decided to check the record to see if there’s any merit to Cloonen’s claim.Confusing claim Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages requesting information and sources used to back up her claim.In a phone interview, Parkhurst told PolitiFact Illinois she has no idea where the Cloonen camp got this information to level the accusation. Parkhurst noted she has represented clients in cases involving Social Security disability benefits for people who were not at the eligible age of 65 -- the opposite of what Cloonen’s ad suggests.""I advocate for people to qualify and obtain those benefits,"" Parkhurst said. ""I have been an advocate for 16 years.""When asked about her general position on Social Security and Medicare, Parkhurst said both are part of a contract the federal government has made with U.S. citizens and one that must be honored, not eliminated.Regardless, the claim against Parkhurst is curious because state lawmakers have no authority over these federal programs.State role in Social Security and Medicare Charlie Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting graduate program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and a long-time former politics and government reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times, says the ad attempts to make a connection that’s not there and ignores the fact that the state only administers these programs and cannot eliminate Social Security benefits or Medicare for seniors.Wheeler said the only quasi-logical explanation behind Cloonen’s claim is that the Democrat is trying to tie Parkhurst to the GOP’s national platform, which many believe includes policies that would hurt the Social Security program.It’s a very old and common campaign tactic to link a local legislative candidate to his or her party’s broader policies and scandals, Wheeler noted, pointing to recent TV ads and campaign mailers in which Democratic and Republican candidates have tried linking their opponents to sex offenders.""The state Legislature and state law have very little to do with Social Security and Medicare. Those are federal programs,"" Wheeler said. ""State involvement would be to the extent that it collects Social Security taxes and passes them on to the federal government.""Our rulingIn a campaign ad posted on Facebook, Cloonen said, ""Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes.""With Social Security and Medicare being federal programs, state lawmakers have no say in setting benefit levels for these programs.Additionally, Parkhurst has not previously held elected office and therefore has no public voting record on Social Security or Medicare. Nor has she talked about her position on Medicare or Social Security benefits in her campaign.Ironically, Parkhurst is a defense attorney whose law firm has helped clients obtain Social Security disability benefits. She believes both Social Security and Medicare are part of a contract the federal government must honor.Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and messages for comment, and the articles cited in the ad contain no mention of Parkhurst.There is no evidence to back Cloonen’s claim, nor can we find any statement or action by Parkhurst that would have, even indirectly, elicited it.We rate Cloonen’s claim Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/487f0897-a88a-4c8f-a8c5-4d5464447785"

PANTS-FIRE,Rush Limbaugh wrong that lack of hurricanes diminishes climate change argument,"As Hurricane Matthew threatened the east coast of Florida, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh cast a far-flung conspiracy about the deadly storm’s hype.  Limbaugh, who lives in Palm Beach County, used his radio show to decry what he sees as the politicization of storms by the left to validate climate change. At the time, Hurricane Matthew was a Category 4 storm.Limbaugh accused the Obama administration of ""playing games"" with hurricane forecasting to push climate change. Hurricane forecasts come from the National Hurricane Center. The center is controlled by the National Weather Service, which falls under the administration’s Commerce Department.Limbaugh recalled how former Vice President Al Gore, author of An Inconvenient Truth, said after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans that the world could expect more destructive hurricanes because of climate change.  His latest theory about U.S. hurricane landfalls amounting to ""a hole right through"" the validity of climate change is also wrong.A history of hurricanesAs Hurricane Matthew approached, Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, tweeted Oct. 5 it has been 4,000 days since the last major hurricane hit the United States (or approximately 10.9 years).A ""major"" hurricane means the storm is a category 3, 4 or 5, said Dave Nolan, another professor of the Rosenstiel School.To be a Category 3 hurricane, winds at the surface must exceed about 115 mph (100 knots) somewhere in the storm. ""Major"" does not refer to size, damages or fatalities — it’s about intensity, as measured by maximum wind speed, Nolan added.Hugh Gladwin, an associate professor in the department of Global and Sociocultural Studies at Florida International University, said Limbaugh added that storm surge and amount of damage are also factors and some would argue more important than wind speed. If those factors are considered, it is possible that Hurricane Sandy, the destructive 2012 storm that disrupted the East Coast, could qualify as a major hurricane.Conflating weather with climateLimbaugh uses the stretch without hurricanes to make a case against climate change, but experts said that’s all wrong.""This has nothing at all to do with climate change,"" Nolan said. ""Hurricanes are extreme events with a lot of variability from year to year, so they can't be used to indicate long term trends about climate.""He also said Limbaugh’s U.S.-centric take on climate change ignores weather events from around the world. An example of these events include super typhoon Haiyan, which was the most intense typhoon to ever hit the Philippines, and Hurricane Patricia, one of the strongest ever to hit Mexico.Suzana Camargo, a professor of ocean and climate physics at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Institute, said the Atlantic only corresponds to about 13 percent of the global number of tropical cyclones (hurricanes), with about 30 percent of the tropical cyclones occurring in the western North Pacific (where they are called typhoons).Point being, the lack of hurricanes hitting the United States is a localized issue, and doesn’t speak about the global issue of climate change.""The relationship between climate change and major hurricanes is complicated and there is not much agreement on it among meteorologists,"" Gladwin said.But explicit connections have not been determined.""It is premature to conclude that human activities — and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming — have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity,"" reads NOAA’s analysis.Nolan said that science has changed course in the last 10 years. Between 1990-2005 some papers suggested that global warming will lead to more and stronger hurricanes, and we can already see this effect over the last 40 years. Since then, academic consensus has emphasized global warming will probably make fewer hurricanes, but some of them will be stronger, and we can't see any trend at all in the historical record.Either way, Limbaugh fails to make the case that the 11-year stretch without major hurricanes hitting the United States disproves climate change.""It's not valid to look at the number of landfalling major hurricanes in the United States to say anything about climate change, since random changes in atmospheric steering currents, unrelated to climate change, are partially responsible for the 11-year U.S. major hurricane drought’,"" said Jeff Masters, the director of meteorology at Weather Underground.Our rulingLimbaugh said the fact that the United States went 11 straight years without major hurricanes ""just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument.""It doesn’t. There are several major flaws in his line of reasoning. First, looking only at major hurricanes that hit the United States ignores storm activity around the world. Second, storm frequency does not strictly correlate with rising temperature. Third, many other data points prove that climate change is real.Limbaugh’s argument is inaccurate and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Claims that Hillary Clinton wore earpiece at debate don't hold up,"The Internet had lots of questions about the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here’s one of them: Was Clinton wearing an earpiece?The original post, at Charisma News, said the device ""was meant to match her skin tone almost perfectly."" The article speculated that the device could be a hearing aid, an ""inductive earpiece"" used by actors to better hear cues, or an ""anti-seizure device.""""None of these paint a particularly good picture for the Democratic presidential nominee. Either she has an as-yet undisclosed health condition, ranging from mild to severe, or she's been cheating during the televised debates,"" the article says.For the record, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that Clinton ""was not wearing an earpiece."" Asked whether she has a hearing aid, he said, ""No.""So, let’s take a look at the original evidence offered -- a Reuters photo and an enlargement that some say show the suspicious, fleshy bulge in Clinton’s ear.To be honest, we don’t see any device in this image. (What’s more flesh-like than flesh itself?) But we decided to look at some other images in our wire service archive to see if anything else made her ear look unusual.When we reached out to Charisma News, an editor suggested that we contact the author of the article. We emailed him the images, but we did not hear back.Close-upClose-upImage 3 (Associated Press/David Goldman)Close-upImage 4 (Associated Press/David Goldman)Close-upIn these four close-ups, we see nothing that mirrors what the original Reuters image showed (which, again, didn’t even look like a device to us). We just see a lot of ear flesh.When we ran these images by Richard Quindry, a Philadelphia-area photographic and Photoshop expert, he said that only image 2 could even potentially show anything -- the narrow white form inside the ear canal. But even saying that that shape is something other than skin would be speculative at best, he said.Each of the other images -- as well as the original Reuters image -- show ""nothing"" to support a claim that she used an earpiece, Quindry said.Our rulingInternet claims suggested that a debate photograph of Clinton showed her wearing an earpiece. Neither the original photograph presented as evidence nor other enlargements of photographs taken at the debate show anything that looks like an earpiece or a hearing aid. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Trump's Pants on Fire claim that black communities 'are absolutely in the worst shape' ever,"In his continuing efforts to court African-American voters -- a group that overwhelmingly backs Hillary Clinton -- Donald Trump took a moment at a rally in Kenansville, N.C., to reiterate his call for African-Americans to turn against the Democratic Party, arguing that the party has poorly served black Americans’ interests for decades.The comment quickly sparked criticism on social media, with many accusing Trump of having no sense of American history.We analyzed Trump’s comment that black American communities are ""in the worst shape"" ever, using history and data.We’ll note here that African-Americans continue to trail white Americans in many important quality-of-life measurements, among them economic, health and criminal justice metrics.Being better than the past is ""a pretty low bar,"" said Bruce Levine, a historian at the University of Illinois-Champaign Urbana, who has authored books about slavery and the Civil War. Not only do African-Americans currently trail whites in many economic measures, but they ""continue to face major discrimination in hiring, access to housing, mortgages, and decent schools and — as almost weekly headlines from around the country demonstrate — death, while unarmed, at the hands of police.""If Trump had simply pointed out the ongoing discrepancies between blacks and whites in economic, health and educational data, he would have had a point. But that’s very different from what he actually said. (His campaign didn’t respond to a request for clarification for this article.)Slavery and Jim CrowThe clearest counterpoints to Trump’s statement are more than two centuries of slavery for African-Americans, followed by another century of discrimination, disenfranchisement and lynchings in the South, the region where most blacks lived at the time.""African-American communities are suffering from many social ailments, including poor schools and high unemployment, and it is important that candidates address these problems and offer specific ways of ameliorating the situation,"" said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian who has written numerous books on slavery and post-Civil War reconstruction. ""However, it is absurd to say they are in the worst shape they've ever been. Putting slavery aside, go back to the Great Depression, or the crack epidemic of the 1970s and 1980s.""Herbert S. Klein, a historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who has written several books about slavery in the Western Hemisphere, agreed.""Not to say that color is not a fundamental marker today of comparative health and well-being — African-Americans are still the poorest and least healthy of the U.S. population,"" he said. ""But it’s still much better than in previous decades.""Trump ""needs a history lesson — or two — desperately,"" added Harold Holzer, a historian at Hunter College who specializes in slavery and the Civil War.He’s also wrong for the past half centuryThere’s solid statistical evidence that the black experience in America has been on an upward trajectory over the past half century or more. Here are some examples:Unemployment for black workers has zigzagged up and down with recessions and recoveries, just as it has for whites. But historically, the present day is a relatively strong period for black employment.In August 2016, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 8.1 percent. While that’s almost double the rate for whites -- 4.4 percent -- it’s only been this low for black Americans in 5 percent of months since 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began specifically tallying monthly black unemployment. Here’s a full chart showing the unemployment rate month by month:The annual black poverty rate never fell below 30 percent between 1966, the first year it was tracked consistently, and 1994. And it has only been lower than it is now in four previous years, starting in 1999 and ending in 2002.Here is a chart from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing life expectancy trends from 1900 to 2000. It shows that whites have outpaced blacks in expanded lifespan, but it also shows that both whites and blacks have risen substantially:And here are the figures from 1970 to 2013, showing a similar pattern.Our rulingTrump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever.""Trump’s emphatic statement lacked any nuance. There is no comparison between the situation today and slavery, or the situation today and the Jim Crow era. Meanwhile, over the past half-century, African-Americans, despite consistently trailing whites, have made significant strides in life expectancy, educational attainment and other measures, and currently have unemployment and poverty rates that are near historical lows.We rate his statement Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/24e837e9-f924-4bfd-8798-7947f6dfa726"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that he 'finished' the Obama birther talk,"""President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period,"" Trump said while briefly addressing the subject at the end of a campaign event at his newly built hotel in Washington.Trump prefaced his statement about Obama’s birthplace by saying, ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean.""Here, we’ll fact-check the assertion that Trump ""finished it.""We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign, but the evening before Trump’s announcement in Washington, Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser with the campaign, sent out a news release saying in part, ""In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised.""But for Trump’s argument to hold water, we see two conditions that have to be met. First, did Trump ""finish"" advocating for the birther viewpoint once Obama released the long-form birth certificate? And second, did Obama’s release of the long-form certificate ""finish"" the idea among American voters that Obama was born outside the United States?In both cases, the answer is no.Trump’s continued birther tweetsThe list includes about three dozen examples between November 2011 and November 2014. Here’s a sampling:Public opinion about Obama’s birthplaceThe birther controversy never actually ended, either, judging by the polls.For starters, the birth certificate release itself didn't eliminate skepticism within the public about Obama’s birthplace -- not even close.Thirteen percent is not a trivial number of people in a nation of more than 300 million people.Our rulingTrump said of the birther controversy, ""I finished it.""In no credible sense is this true. Trump didn’t ""finish"" fanning the flames of birther conspiracies once Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 -- he kept tweeting about it for at least another three and a half years. And a core group of Americans hasn’t ""finished"" expressing birther sentiments.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Hillary Clinton 'has no child care plan',"In a Sept. 13 campaign event in Aston, Pa., Donald Trump unveiled a new, multi-pronged child care agenda.But Trump didn’t stop with his policy offering. Trump accused Clinton -- who started her career at the Children’s Defense Fund and who’s considered child care a signature issue of her political career -- of not having any proposals for parents worried about their child care challenges.""While critical, meaningful policy work has been done in this area, my opponent has no child care plan,"" Trump said. ""She never will. They'll never evolve into a plan. They'll never get done anyway.""Trump wasn’t the only member of his campaign to make this point. His daughter Ivanka -- who became the first person involved in the campaign to publicly focus on child care policy when she gave an address at the Republican National Convention -- echoed that point in an interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly.""There’s no policy on Hillary Clinton’s website pertaining to any of these issues -- child care, elder care, or maternity leave or paternity leave, for that matter,"" Ivanka Trump said.When we asked the Trump campaign to reconcile these headings with his comment, they responded that those two topics are separate and distinct from ""child care."" The campaign argued that ""child care"" refers to ages 0 to 4 -- before ""early childhood education"" begins at age 4 with preschool. The campaign also said that paid maternity leave is a policy area that’s separate from child care policy.Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who was cited favorably in Trump’s policy proposal, said he has ""never before heard of ‘child care’ being defined as limited to ages 0 to 4."" He added that the Trump campaign’s decision to include children up to age 13 suggests that ""the campaign does not itself define child care in that odd manner.""Still, let’s set aside whether the Trump campaign’s definitions are widely accepted. Instead, let’s use the campaign’s definition to see whether Clinton really has no policies relating to child care for those age 0 to 4.As long as you look deeper than the section headings on her website, Clinton does have policies addressing that age range. Specifically, she says:• ""No family in America (should have to) pay more than 10 percent of its income to afford high-quality child care,"" a goal to be accomplished by ""by significantly increasing the federal government’s investment in child care subsidies and providing tax relief for the cost of child care to working families.""• ""Award scholarships of up to $1,500 per year to help as many as 1 million student parents afford high-quality child care.""• ""Hillary will work to dramatically increase access to child care on campus by increasing funding for campus-based child care centers.""So there are policies on Clinton’s website that address child care for ages 0 to 4. The Trump campaign didn’t respond after we forwarded them these examples.Viard agreed that the Clinton campaign ""clearly has proposals for many aspects of child care, as commonly defined, and even under the odd 0 to 4 definition. Her 10 percent plan would apply to children in that age range, as well as to older children, and Early Head Start is targeted to children under the age of 3.""Our rulingTrump said that ""my opponent has no child care plan."" Even under the campaign’s unusual, age-related definition of policies for children aged 0 to 4, Clinton has several policies to offer on her website.

We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so,"" Clinton said. ""I am hoping that the outcome of the election, which I am working hard to ensure a victory, will send a clear message to our Republican friends that it’s time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform.""That example alone is enough to disprove Trump’s claim.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump repeats Pants on Fire claim about '30 million' illegal immigrants,"In a major policy speech on immigration, Donald Trump criticized the government’s approach to the undocumented population, sayings the feds don’t even know the scope of the problem.""Honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million,"" Trump said. ""They have no idea what the number is. Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.""Is it possible that, a year later, Trump’s claim of 3 million or 30 million is more accurate?The answer is still no.Estimating the undocumentedThe U.S. Homeland Security Department last estimated the size of the undocumented immigrant population at 11.4 million in January 2012, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. This count includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who overstayed their visas.Figures from independent organizations that study immigration are all in the same ballpark. Here’s a rundown:Unauthorized population size (2012)Unauthorized population size (latest year)Dept. of Homeland Security11.4 millionPew Research Center11.2 million11.3 million (2014)Center for Migration Studies11.1 million10.9 million (2014)Center for Immigration Studies 11 to 12 million11.7 million (2016)**This is a preliminary estimate.All of these figures come from subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census.Researchers at all of the organizations told us Trump’s statement is wildly inaccurate.There is ""absolutely zero possibility"" for the number to be just 3 million or as many as 30 million,"" according to Robert Warren of the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan immigration policy think tank.""There is strong evidence that the number is 11 million, with a plausible margin of error of plus or minus 1 million,"" he said.Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Research Center, called both of Trump’s numbers ""virtually impossible"" and explained why. On the low end, survey data shows large enough foreign-born populations and legal admissions that there could not be as few as 3 million people.The high-end of Trump’s offered estimate is contradicted by the limited number of housing units in the United States, Mexico and Central America’s census data and surveys’ size, and U.S. data on admissions and departures.""There’s simply no way for an additional 20 million people to be in the country and have escaped detection,"" Passel said.If the figure really is as high as 30 million, school enrollment and birth registration would reflect that, as both public schooling and birthright citizenship are incentives for undocumented immigrants, pointed out Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigrants.""But the numbers are not out of whack,"" Camarota said. ""Bottom line is we don’t know what the number is for sure. But based on the available evidence, it seems very unlikely that it’s 20 million (more).""Why it’s ‘always’ 11 millionTrump suggested he was skeptical of the 11 million figure because it’s ""always"" been the estimate. Experts told us there’s a good explanation for that: a steady flow of people coming in and leaving.""The reason that he has heard the same number for years is that the population has not been growing,"" said Warren.""There’s enormous churn in the illegal immigration population. Hundreds of thousands come in at 11 million and then hundreds of thousands leave,"" Camarota said, adding that the undocumented population is a demographically unusual group as it can’t grow by births (as all children born in the United States are citizens).But even if you folded in these citizen children, the number would be 17 million at most, he said.While the federal estimate hasn’t been updated in a few years, experts agreed that the outside groups’ calculations are sound. Still, Camarota criticized the government for not providing a more recent figure.""This creates enormous uncertainty in a debate about an important policy issue. It’s like saying, ‘We should do something about the deficit, but we don’t know how big it is,’ "" he said. ""We talk about something that everyone perceives is a problem without any data.""Our rulingTrump said the number of illegal immigrants ""could be 3 million. It could be 30 million.""Both figures are not within the range of possibility. Every credible estimate we found was in the 11 million range, with a margin of error of around 1 million.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump is wrong that 'inner-city crime is reaching record levels',"Aiming to blunt an overwhelming edge among African-American voters, Donald Trump has been decrying longstanding black support for Democratic politicians, who he blames for allowing economic inequality and crime to fester in African-American communities.Is Trump correct that ""inner-city crime is reaching record levels""?No, not even close.Record levels?There is no official category -- or even a definition -- for ""inner-city"" crime. So the best we can do is look at crime in large cities. Among the crime data the FBI collects is for that committed in cities over 250,000 in population, so that’s what we used.The chart below shows the rate of all violent crimes -- including homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- committed per 100,000 people, which is a standard way of measuring the extent of crime. The top line shows the rate for cities over 250,000 in population, while the lower rate shows it for the country as a whole.The two lines track each other fairly well, but the trend is unmistakable: The frequency of violent crime has declined since the early-to-mid 1990s.We also looked at one subset of the violent crime rate -- the homicide rate -- for both the country as a whole and for cities over 250,000 in population.The patterns for homicide are the same as they are for violent crime generally -- they have been declining since the early-to-mid 1990s.A cursory look at a few specific cities shows that the number of murders, even at their somewhat elevated rate today, are well below their peaks in the 1990s.The recent spike in crimeWe should note that even if crime isn’t hitting record levels, there is growing evidence that there has been a one-year uptick, at least in certain cities. Trump’s supporters have seized on this as evidence that Trump isn’t totally off base in claiming that crime is on the rise.Scholarly research published since our original fact-check suggests that the uptick is indeed notable.Rosenfeld found that the preliminary increase in homicides ""was real and nearly unprecedented."" But he also added that it was not universal in the nation’s big cities. Only certain cities seemed to see significant increases.Specifically, he found that 10 out of the 56 large cities he studied ""produced two-thirds of the big-city homicide increase in 2015."" Most cities either showed small increases or declines. Here is a chart he assembled showing how big or small a spike each of the cities experienced:Rosenfeld found that the 10 cities with the biggest spikes tended to have higher poverty rates, higher African-American populations and smaller Hispanic populations. However, he wrote that beyond that, there is insufficient public data available at this time to determine the precise cause, or mix of causes, for the top 10 cities’ homicide spikes.In any case, none of this supports Trump’s more recent statement that crime is approaching ""record levels.""Even if the recent spike proves durable, the rates of homicides and violent crime in general have fallen so much in the past 25 years that the recent increases will not push them up to ""record"" levels at any time in the near future.""The increase in crime in inner cities in 2015 was a large one-year increase, but you can see that the long-term trend is way down,"" said Alan Lizotte, a criminologist at the University at Albany. ""The recent spike would need to continue for a while to reach early 1990s levels.""""Inner-city crime rates are not even close to record levels,"" agreed James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""And crime rates among African-Americans, especially youth, were much, much higher in the early 1990s.""Our rulingTrump said that ""inner-city crime is reaching record levels.""Criminologists say that it is worth watching the recent jump in homicides in certain big cities to see whether it represents a lasting trend or just a blip. However, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate has fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the ""record levels"" of the early 1990s.We rate the statement Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47151ed3-abf3-4b0c-9021-db2c19f155e6"
PANTS-FIRE,Celia Israel repeats unverified claim that Donald Trump's campaign hats are made in China,"Not welcoming Donald Trump to the Texas capital, a legislator said she can’t wait for Hillary Clinton’s election and improved chances of comprehensive immigration reform.""Your words are cheap, Mr. Trump,"" Israel said, ""as cheap as the made-in-China gimme caps that proclaim that you will make America great again.""At the time, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, told PunditFact: ""All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA."" Hicks was more specific when we asked about Israel’s comment, saying by email: ""All official campaign product, including the hats, are made in the USA.""The story called the made-in-China claim about Trump’s hats a ""short-lived rumor.""Kennedy told the AP: ""I'm not using imported materials.

PANTS-FIRE,Clinton repeats wrong claim that no other 2016 candidate pledged not to raise middle-class taxes,"One of Hillary Clinton’s key campaign promises is that she won’t raise taxes on the middle class.In an Aug. 17 speech in Cleveland, the Democratic presidential nominee said, ""I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class.""We found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton’s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone — including the middle class. Donald Trump was not one of these; more on this in a bit.So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges — not just on the middle class but everyone.Who resisted?We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class.For our July fact-check, we asked Clinton’s campaign for an explanation of her and got a generic response. ""Hillary Clinton’s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email.Our rulingClinton said, ""I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class.""Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other two inked such a pledge earlier in their careers. Trump wasn’t one of them, but Clinton specifically mentioned the primary field. And that makes the claim both inaccurate and ridiculous.We rate this claim, again, Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Trump campaign chair misquotes Russian media in bogus claim about NATO base terrorist attack,"But when CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper brought up Trump’s seeming inability to stay on message, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort insisted it’s the press who can’t lay off of Trump.We hadn’t seen the terrorist attack covered either and wondered if the media had neglected a major story in order to wax on about Trump’s comments.Indeed, reputable news outlets didn’t cover this story — because it didn’t happen as Manafort said.Manafort seems to be fumbling an errant story from Russian state media.The two Kremlin-funded outlets suggested that the lockdown was in response to another coup attempt after a faction of the Turkish military failed to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.So already Manafort is wrong about two key points: The incident occurred two weeks before Trump’s Second Amendment remarks and did not involve terrorists.What’s more, the Russian outlets’ reports were not exactly reliable.But that’s a far cry from a terrorist attack that flew under the news radar.Officials at the Pentagon and NATO told us there have been no terrorist attacks at Incirlik or NATO’s Allied Central Command (LANDCOM) in Izmir, Turkey. The NATO official also pointed out that Incirlik is actually not a NATO base, though U.S. and Spanish troops are stationed there.Our rulingManafort said there was a ""NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists"" the week Trump made his comments about ""Second Amendment people.""Russian media speculated that there was a second attempted coup at Incirlik air base in Turkey. That incident was exaggerated and occurred two weeks before Trump’s comments. Furthermore, though it houses NATO troops, Incirlik is not a NATO base. Neither Incirlik or NATO’s central headquarters in Izmir, Turkey, have been attacked by terrorists.The event Manafort described did not happen. We rate Manafort’s claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Viral post alleges voter fraud in Wood County, Ohio","A viral image is making new rounds on the Internet, asking, ""Ever wonder why Republicans want Voter ID?""Similar claims popped up after the 2012 election between President Barack Obama and the former governor of Massachusetts, Republican Mitt Romney.We wondered if claims about Ohio counties were any more accurate.In northwest Ohio, Wood County is home to Bowling Green, the city and university of the same name.The first statement reads, ""In 21 districts in Wood County, Ohio, Obama received 100 percent of the votes where GOP inspectors were illegally removed from their polling locations — and not one single vote was recorded for Romney. (A statistical impossibility.)""The second statement says that ""106,258 people in Wood County are registered to vote out of an eligible 98,213.""The third says, ""In one Ohio county, Obama won by 108 percent of the total number of eligible voters.""Is something rotten in Wood? These claims unravel quickly with a check of 2012 poll results.100 percent of the vote?We’ll start with the claim about Obama getting 100 percent of the votes in 21 Wood County ""districts."" First off, in Ohio they’re called precincts, not districts.Ghost registrationsNow for the post’s second statement about over-registrations. The 98,213 number comes from the 2010 census total of people 18 and over in Wood County.According to the election board’s data from 2012, there were 108,014 registered voters in the county at that time — an even bigger gap between people and voters than what the meme claimed.But that doesn’t mean there is foul play.108 percentNow let’s consider the post’s vague reference to ""one Ohio county"" where Obama allegedly got 108 percent of the vote. The numbers for Wood County, where the meme suggests that fraud is so rampant, lead us to believe that this is still about Wood. The number of registered voters, 106,258, is about 108 percent of 98,213, the size of the vote-eligible population in 2012.But election results show that in real life, Obama received 51 percent of the vote in Wood County.We asked Carol DeJong, deputy director of the Wood County Board of Elections, why conspiracy theorists are obsessed with her county. ""As a reporter, you would be better at solving that mystery,"" she replied via email.Our rulingA viral post makes several claims about 2012 voter fraud in Ohio, ginning up fears ahead of the 2016 presidential election.But the election tallies discredit the claims about voter fraud in Ohio.Election board officials cannot corroborate the claim of GOP monitors being ""illegally removed"" from polling places. The numbers 106,258 (registered voters) and 98,213 (residents old enough to vote) include the ghost registrations of inactive voters that lingered on the rolls. Finally, Obama got 51 percent of the vote in Wood County, not 108 percent.This viral image is 108 percent wrong.We rate it Pants on Fire!https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/86f594ee-8169-4425-9303-725a584210df"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's baseless claims about the election being 'rigged',"Donald Trump preemptively challenged the results of the November presidential election, claiming in media appearances and rallies that the entire system is ""rigged.""""Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" he said at an Aug. 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio. ""People are going to walk in and they're going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?""This is a serious allegation that challenges the integrity of the election, so we asked the Trump campaign to elaborate. We didn’t hear back.When Trump has offered specifics — people voting though they’re ineligible, people voting multiple times, people impersonating dead voters — he’s actually talking about voter fraud, committed by individuals and committed very rarely.Stolen 2012 election?To sow doubts about the 2016 election, Trump pointed to alleged rigging in 2012.While some precincts in Philadelphia exclusively voted for Obama in 2012, it’s grasping for straws to claim this is evidence for election rigging.When the paper sought out the few registered Republicans living in the 59 districts, it found that several had moved, others didn’t realize they were registered with the party, and others confirmed that they had voted for Obama despite their political identification.Trumped up charges of voter fraudFor example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license.To sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake ID’s or forge their signatures — plus be willing to commit perjury the entire time.How to rig an electionFrom New York’s Tammany Hall to the motto of ""vote early and often"" popularized in Chicago, election fraud is certainly part of U.S. political history. But election rigging today is constrained to local elections, as implementing a national election heist would be extremely difficult.""Given the decentralized nature of our elections, there would be no single way to throw the results,"" said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. ""Instead you’d have to target enough states to make a difference in the Electoral College.""The first way is through buying votes, especially absentee ballots.This is possible on a small scale because of a ""corrupt deal"" between local election officials and ""family fiefdoms"" with deep roots in municipal politics, Berry said.Presidential elections, on the other hand, are under much more scrutiny than sheriff races and subject to federal prosecution. For that reason, and given how complicated organizing the conspiracy across different communities would be, Berry says it’s not probable that a national campaign or outside group would take the risk to buy a few votes.""That’s not an indication of the system being rigged. That’s an indication that it’s lost its calibration,"" said Pamela Smith of Verified Voting, which monitors technological issues in elections.She added that Trump likely was referring to voter reports of this common issue of overuse, while election rigging ""would require you not noticing."" (Smith couldn’t think of any examples of machines being tampered with and said, from her research, issues usually result from programming errors.)Ballots cast on some electronic voting systems, however, don’t have a paper trail, meaning the votes are not verifiable. Hackers could theoretically alter the results. But this would also require a potential wrongdoer to physically access the machines on Election Day and serious coordination to circumvent all the security and auditing measures in place before, during and after voting, said Smith, adding, ""There are very few paths in the present scenario to flip something off the radar.""""Technological rigging or the more classic stuffing of the ballot box are not the kind of things that could be easily done or on the kind of scale that could affect an election,"" Hasen said. ""Trump’s unsupported allegations are dangerous and fantasy.""Our rulingTrump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. election system is rigged.He has cited examples of voter fraud, which is extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election.While there are isolated examples of bought local elections, experts say it cannot be replicated on a national scale. While it is possible to tamper with electronic voting machines, there is no evidence deliberate malfeasance has altered any election.We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE, Internet: Philly rigged the 2012 presidential election. Experts: Still no,"Update 5:34 p.m.Okay. So, we’re still talking about this.This kind of happened, and it’s not actually mathematically impossible. First, the 59 refers to the City of Philadelphia, not the metropolitan area or region. An absolutely crucial fact: The 59 zones that saw no votes for Romney were not districts, but divisions. There are nearly 1,700 divisions in Philadelphia. Each of the city’s 66 wards claims between 10 and 50 of them.To provide a sense of how small divisions are, currently, the average number of registered voters per division is 616. The division out of the 59 with the lowest turnout counted 139 votes in 2012; the highest was 612.Experts say these divisions reflect a trend of heavily Democratic inner-city neighborhoods. Considering how few Republicans live in these micro-neighborhoods, it’s not shocking that Romney would have a tough go of it against the nation’s first black president, in 59 subzones that only represented a mere 3.5 percent of the city’s vote in aggregate. Our rulingA viral image has called 59 Philadelphia voter ""districts"" counting zero Romney votes in the 2012 general election ""(a) mathematical and statistical impossibility.""Only, these divisions were not the size of districts. They were much smaller, encompassing hundreds rather than thousands, and in predominately African-American areas of the city.Looking at the voter records from six months prior, Democrats in these areas outnumbered Republicans more than 20 to one. That’s before considering what the Inquirer’s reporting suggests: That out of the small minority of GOPers in these sections, many don’t align with the party, or don’t appear to live there anymore.Were the 59 divisions worthy of investigation? Yes. And that happened in 2012, and has happened numerous times since.We rule this claim a Pants on Fire. An earlier version of this story incorrectly cited PolitiFact Ohio. The reporting had been published by PolitiFact National."
PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Barack Obama 'founded' ISIS, Hillary Clinton was 'cofounder'","Donald Trump has found a ferocious way to describe President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: as the founder and cofounder of ISIS, the terrorist group behind beheadings of Americans and lethal attacks around the world.In fact, when Hewitt proposed a more cautious interpretation of his assertion — that Obama and Clinton ""created the vacuum"" in the region and thus ""lost the peace"" to ISIS — Trump rejected that formulation, sticking with the most literal version of ""founder"" and ""co-founder.""""No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS,"" Trump told Hewitt. ""I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.""Hewitt pushed back, saying, ""But he’s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He’s trying to kill them.""Trump dismissed that again, saying, ""I don’t care. He was the founder. The way he got out of Iraq was, that, that was the founding of ISIS, okay?""And hours after the Hewitt interview aired, Trump tripled down on the attack in a speech to the National Association of Homebuilders in Miami Beach once again accusing them of being the founder and cofounder of ISIS.Now he’s taking it a step further with the ""co-founded"" attack.Let us be clear: It is wildly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton ""co-founded"" ISIS.The creation of ISISExperts have repeatedly told us that the sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected.But Trump’s provocative comment glosses over all of that nuance.After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014.The most prominent leader of the group we now call ISIS has been Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who became the leader in 2010.Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.But you could also argue Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots and regroup.The Trump campaign sent us links to articles about how the Obama administration handled the situation in the Middle East that influenced the rise of ISIS.""So yes, Hillary's vote for President Bush's misguided policy to build democracy in Iraq directly assisted the Republican decision that opened the door to the radicalization of Iraq and destabilization of the Levant,"" said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told us in July when Trump attacked Clinton. ""Bush's destruction of the Iraq Army and state is the single-most important decision that led to the expansion of al-Qaida into the region and later emergence of ISIS.""Trump’s campaign has also pointed to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya as evidence for allowing ISIS to grow. As secretary of state in 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria and said Assad needed to ""get out of the way.""""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion.""As Hewitt suggested in the interview, it’s possible to argue that the administration’s withdrawing from Iraq, its lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and its decision to intervene in Libya contributed to the power of ISIS.These concerns track those we’ve heard from foreign-policy experts. However, this more limited and defensible critique of Clinton’s record is what Hewitt offered Trump on his radio show, and the candidate forcefully rejected it out of hand — twice.Our rulingTrump said Obama ""founded ISIS. I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.""There’s a credible critique that Obama’s and Clinton’s foreign-policy and military decisions helped create a space in which ISIS could operate and expand. But Trump explicitly rejected this formulation, saying he literally means Obama is ""the founder of ISIS"" and Clinton is the ""cofounder.""In reality, the founder of ISIS was a terrorist. It is run by terrorists. Obama has said destroying ISIS is his ""top priority.""All this makes Trump’s statement a ridiculous characterization. He’s doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on it in various venues and has reinforced that he meant his words to be taken literally.We rate it Pants on Fire."

St. Lucie County had a ballot with two pages, meaning voters who completed both pages cast two cards.The disclaimer said: ""Turnout percentages will show over 100% due to a two-page ballot.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about doing better than Kelly Ayotte in N.H. polls,"Presidential nominee Donald Trump waded into New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate race this week, claiming he is doing better than fellow Republican Kelly Ayotte in statewide polls.Do the numbers bear that out? We took a closer look.Of course, the Republican businessman is running for president, not against Ayotte for Senate. But we interpreted his comment as saying he is having a better showing in polls in New Hampshire.Trump didn’t name any specific polls in his interview, and his campaign did not provide source material or respond to a request for comment. So we looked at their favorability ratings among the state’s voters, and also examined how tight their races are in New Hampshire.We turned to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks polling data and calculates an average of the most recent voter surveys.So, not only is Trump not ""beating (Ayotte) in the polls by a lot,"" he’s not beating her in the polls at all. Ayotte is doing better than Trump in New Hampshire.Just to be extra careful, we also checked to see whether there was a period in which Trump was performing better against Clinton than Ayotte was against Hassan but couldn’t find one in the RealClearPolitics.com archive.How about favorability ratings, which show how warmly voters feel towards a candidate, rather than whether they would or would not vote for them in an election matchup?The most recent WMUR Granite State Poll, released in late July, showed that Trump had a net favorability of negative 29 percent, while Ayotte scored a positive two percent net favorability rating. (Net favorability refers to the candidate’s favorability score minus his or her unfavorability score.)The WBUR poll, released on August 4 after Trump’s comment, showed similar patterns. Twenty-nine percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, it found, while 60 percent had an unfavorable opinion, with 10 percent are undecided.So the two recent polls showed that Ayotte’s favorability rating in the Granite State was far higher than Trump’s.Our rulingTrump said he is beating Ayotte in the polls ""by a lot.""

PANTS-FIRE,Trump falsely accuses Colorado fire marshal of ‘incompetence’ over crowd restrictions,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blasted fire marshals across the country over crowd-size restrictions at venues, including accusing marshals in Colorado and Ohio of incompetence or political skulduggery within three days.The latest fireworks began July 29, at Trump’s rally at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs.The billionaire real estate developer entered the Gallogly Events Center to a cheering crowd. But he quickly launched into an attack on Colorado Springs Fire Marshal Brett Lacey.""This is why our country doesn't work,"" Trump said. ""We have thousands of people in (an overflow) room next door. We have plenty of space here. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. And we have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people.' ... And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing.""Trump continued to blame the fire marshal for the ""disgraceful situation"" during his one-hour address. He decried Lacey’s ""incompetence,"" saying ""he's probably a Democrat"" and ""maybe they're a Hillary person.""Our research shows Trump is wrong on several counts. Public records show Lacey is a registered Republican, and fire officials were following standard guidelines for crowd limits.Standing roomTrump’s account of what went wrong at the rally and who was to blame is questionable.There were 1,100 people -- not ""thousands"" as he said -- in the overflow room who watched his speech on a TV screen.There was a line of people left outside, but it’s unclear if included ""thousands of people,"" as he said.What about Trump’s claim that ""We have plenty of space here,"" to let more people into the events center?  Colorado Springs Fire Department spokesman Steve Wilch told PolitiFact the Trump campaign was aware a day before the rally that Lacey, the fire marshal, had limited the events center to 1,500 spectators and the overflow room to 1,000 spectators.  PolitiFact requested comment from the Trump campaign but received no reply.In an interview after the rally, Lacey told PolitiFact partner Denver7 that he based his crowd restrictions on a Thursday walk through of the event center and the overflow room, where he double-checked the exits, the size of the space and potential obstructions like crowd-control barriers, the stage and platforms for news cameras.Lacey also reviewed the original construction design plans for the building, which had passed international fire and building codes. These plans include a ""life-safety sheet,"" detailing the building’s intended use, square footage, capacity and exits.The fire code, which most fire agencies rely on, is ""based on the premise that every space can hold a certain number of people based on the square footage, and then based on the number of people we're going to provide the proper number of exits,"" Boulder Chief Fire Marshal Dave  Lowrey told PolitiFact.What the building is used for is key to determining space requirements known as the ""occupant load factor."" Restaurants are required to provide 15 square feet per person, because they have tables and chairs that people need to get around while fleeing an emergency, Lowrey said. At a political rally, where people are sitting on folding chairs, the code requires 7 square feet per person. If it’s standing-room-only, the requirement is 5 square feet per person.Emergency exits are a key ‘life-safety factor’But the most important ""life-safety factor"" is the number of exits.""If you can't get out of building in an emergency, well, you're in a whole a lot of trouble,"" Lowrey said. ""Every large, tragic indoor fire has probably been contributed to somehow by overcrowding, and blocked exits or locked doors.""Lacey said he worked closely with the Secret Service, police and UCCS officials as he made his decision about the right ""occupant loads"" for the venues. These officials weren’t the only ones who agreed to the fire marshal’s decisions on crowd restrictions.  Three days before the rally, Trump campaign treasurer, Timothy Jost, and UCCS officials signed a ""Facility Usage License Agreement."" The contract stated that the campaign ""shall comply with...all other rules and regulations prescribed by the Fire and Police Departments and other governmental authorities, as may be in force and effect during the terms of this Agreement.""  So the Trump campaign had agreed to comply with the fire department’s safety requirements days before the candidate blew up at the fire marshal.Earlier Friday afternoon, Lacey received a call from the police command center that there was a request to allow more people into the rally. After conferring with security officials and an on-site fire battalion chief, Lacey said he was comfortable with a 10 percent increase in the events center crowd (to 1,650) and the overflow room (to 1,100).Denver7 asked Lacey about Trump’s assertions that he was a disgrace and ""probably a Democrat.""""Absolutely not,"" the fire marshal replied. ""Anytime that any of the members of the Colorado Springs Fire Department are working, the politics or policies like that are not on our agenda. We're here for public safety and making certain our community is safe from harm.""""If the event planners wanted to have more people inside, we have a number of venues here in the Colorado Springs area that they could have secured,"" Lacey added. ""But this is the event (venue) that they chose.""While fire marshals wrestle with these life-or-death decisions, they’ve also had Trump publicly berating them in at least four states.In Ohio on Monday, Trump pulled aside reporters before a rally at the Greater Columbus Convention Center to rail against another fire marshal’s crowd restrictions.PolitiFact did check it out and obtained documents from the Greater Columbus Convention Center that contradicted Trump's claims that his campaign was blindsided by the crowd restrictions.The center’s ""event acknowledgement"" document, containing the name and contact information for Trump campaign official John Hiller, stated the maximum event capacity was ""800+ media (not to exceed 1,000 per Fire marshal and contract)."" The document states ""This event is by invitation"" and it was ""Fire marshal approved.""

I don't want to over-crowd. If something does happen, I want to make sure people can get out,"" said Lowery, the Boulder fire marshal.Our rulingTrump claimed, ""We have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people’....And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing.""The Colorado Springs fire marshal laid out a clear explanation of how he set the crowd capacity based on fire codes and the professional calculus of how many people can swiftly and safely be evacuated if an emergency occurs. A Trump campaign official signed a contract agreeing to comply with the fire department’s rules and the campaign was notified of the crowd limits a day before the event.In at least four states, the Republican nominee has accused fire marshals of incompetence or political favoritism during crowd-capacity disputes.

PANTS-FIRE,"Trump spox's absurd claim that Clinton, Obama are responsible for Capt. Humayun Khan's 2004 death","As Donald Trump attacked the family of a Muslim soldier killed in the Iraq war, his spokeswoman blamed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for Capt. Humayun Khan’s 2004 death.Given that Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton secretary of state, we were perplexed by this statement, so we reached out to Pierson.Pierson reiterated those points in an Aug. 3, interview with CNN. ""Apologize for the timeline. What I was talking about is the fact that Donald Trump has no connection to anything having to do with Capt. Khan, who was a brave war hero. The timeline is very simple and true ... Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq. She did not support the surge. Barack Obama made things worse by invading more countries than President Bush did""Pierson is well within her rights to critique Clinton’s voting record and Obama’s defense policies. But in her original CNN interview, she went further and said Obama and Clinton changed the rules of engagement that ""probably cost"" Khan’s life.That’s nonsensical. Even if we put the anachronism aside, experts told us restrictive rules of engagement  — military directives that regulate the use of force in armed conflict — were not an issue in Khan’s death.According to his commanding officer, Khan ordered his man to ""hit the ground"" as he approached the vehicle and motioned for it to stop. The bomb then exploded, killing Khan as well as the two suicide bombers and two Iraqi civilians.""Capt. Khan had all the authority in the world to use deadly force"" under the rules of engagement, said Bolgiano, who was serving in Iraq in 2004. He added that Khan’s actions were a testament to his bravery and selflessness.Khan was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star.Experts warned that politicization of the rules of engagement were not appropriate and potentially dangerous.""I can’t think of anything worse than somehow getting into a tactical situation where you’re going to have to deal with concerns in the field over campaign rhetoric,"" Cordesman said.Our rulingPierson said, ""It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt.

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Clinton, Democrats rigged debate dates to conflict with NFL","Did Democrats rig the presidential debate schedule so the highly anticipated faceoffs would run opposite major sporting events? Donald Trump seems to think so.Trump’s tweet underscores one of Trump’s recurring campaign themes -- that Hillary Clinton is ""crooked,"" including playing with a stacked deck against her primary challenger, Bernie Sanders.The short answer is that Trump is wrong: The national parties have no role in setting the dates for the general-election debates. They were actually determined by an independent, bipartisan organization, well in advance of when the parties’ nominees became clear this year. (Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry.)The debate-setting processUnlike primary debates, which are set by the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in collaboration with media outlets, the four general-election debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.While presidential debates were held in 1960, 1976, 1980 and 1984, the current system emerged in 1987 with the creation of the commission. At the time, it was co-chaired by two party leaders, Democrat Paul Kirk and Republican Frank Fahrenkopf.Those two men left their party positions in 1989, and since then the commission has included both Democrats and Republicans, along with journalists and other prominent figures, while staying away from people holding the parties’ official leadership positions.Fahrenkopf remains a co-chair, with Mike McCurry, a spokesman for then-President Bill Clinton, co-chairing for the Democrats. Democrats on the commission include former Rep. Jane Harman of California, while the Republicans include former Sens. John Danforth of Missouri and Olympia Snowe of Maine and former Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana.""The way to depoliticize is to do everything early -- the candidate-inclusion criteria, the dates and locations, the formats, "" Schroeder said.In the case of the 2016 general election debates, Schroeder said in January 2015 the commission solicited bids from universities willing to host a debate, and announced the 16 applicants in April 2015.Back then, the Republican field had 17 candidates and there was widespread skepticism that Trump could win the nomination. Clinton, for her part, was the frontrunner but facing a spirited challenge from Sanders.It shouldn’t be a surprise that there would be a game on a Sunday or a Monday night -- the NFL has been playing football on Monday nights since 1970 and on Sunday nights since 1987. But it’s something of a game of triage when trying to avoid sporting events at that time of year. Besides professional football, debate planners typically have to contend with playoff baseball and Saturday college football.""In choosing the dates, the commission sits down with a calendar to look at network programming -- the Olympics, playoff games, religious holidays,"" Schroeder said. ""It’s never a clear calendar -- there are always conflicts of some kind or another. So they pick the best days possible and days that would generate most viewership.""""The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debates. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result.""As a point of reference, in a four-year period, there are four general election debates (three presidential and one vice presidential) and approximately 1,000 NFL games.""The CPD selects the debate dates a year in advance in order for the television networks to have maximum lead time and predictability in scheduling these extremely important civic education forums. The CPD believes the dates for the 2016 debates will service the American public well.""And of course, for Americans torn between football and politics, there are more options today than ever, including DVR and online streaming.Put it all together, Schroeder said, and the ""idea of anyone gaming that process is really inconceivable.""Our rulingTrump said that Clinton and her party ""are trying to rig the debates"" so that NFL games drain away viewers.However, neither Clinton nor her party were involved in setting up the dates for the general-election debates, as they were during the primary debates. Instead, that task falls to a bipartisan commission that has no connection to either the campaigns or the parties. In fact, the debate dates were chosen seven months before the NFL schedule was even released, making scheduling conflicts almost unavoidable -- not the work of one campaign or party.We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Hillary Clinton's wrong claim that FBI director Comey called her comments about email 'truthful',"Hillary Clinton said that she has told the public a consistent and truthful story about classified material on her emails, and FBI director James Comey backed her up. That immediately caught our attention.Wallace remarked, ""After a long investigation, FBI director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true.""That’s not what Clinton heard Comey say, she responded.""Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails,"" she said.Clinton appears to have selective hearing.In saying Comey called her answers ""truthful,"" Clinton was apparently referring to — and putting a positive spin on — a comment Comey made in a July 7 congressional hearing regarding Clinton’s closed-door interview with the FBI as part of their investigation. Comey said, ""We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.""In her interview with Wallace, Clinton was making the point that what she told the public is consistent with what she told the FBI, and Comey said what she told the FBI was ""truthful,"" campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.So Clinton’s statement implies that Comey has confirmed that her public comments are accurate. That is incorrect.Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked Comey at the July 7 congressional hearing, ""Did she lie to the public?""Comey responded, ""That's a question I'm not qualified to answer.""He also said he hadn’t compared Clinton’s public comments with the FBI interview to see if there were inconsistencies. There is no transcript of the FBI interview.When Comey announced the FBI’s findings July 5, it was clear that there are obvious inconsistencies between what Clinton said publicly about classified information on her private email server before her FBI interview and what the FBI found. Pointedly, Clinton said there wasn’t any classified information in her email, and he said there was.But Comey reported that, of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 individual emails contained classified information, and three of them bore markings signifying their classification status. (Information can still be classified even if it does not have a label.) Eight email threads contained top-secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information.About 2,000 emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was emailed, but it is now.Then, there was this exchange between Comey and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., at the congressional hearing:In fairness to Clinton, Comey said some of the classified emails were insufficiently marked, and it’s understandable that she didn’t realize that some of the ones without labels were actually classified.But he also said of some of the classified emails that did not bear markings, ""There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.""We’ll also note a couple other major inconsistencies between Clinton’s remarks and the FBI’s findings:Clinton repeatedly said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department in 2014, about 30,000 emails. However, Comey said FBI investigators uncovered ""several thousand"" work-related emails that she had not handed over to the State Department.Comey said that while there’s no evidence anyone successfully hacked Clinton’s email servers, they certainly were susceptible to attack. There was no full-time security staff, which are found at government agencies and commercial email providers like Google. Further, he noted that Clinton used her personal email abroad, which could have allowed ""hostile actors"" to access her account.Our rulingClinton said regarding the presence of classified information in her email, FBI director James ""Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people.""A reasonable person would interpret Clinton’s statement to mean that Comey has endorsed her public remarks about her email. This is not the case.Talking specifically about Clinton’s closed-door FBI interview, Comey said there is ""no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI"" about her email practices. But Comey has specifically declined to comment on whether Clinton’s public remarks have been accurate.Further, while not explicitly rebuking Clinton’s public comments, Comey highlighted a major problem with them.Clinton repeatedly said she did not have any classified information whatsoever in her email, marked or unmarked. After the FBI investigation, including the interview with Clinton, Comey said she unequivocally did.We rate her claim Pants on Fire."

Parents have a secondary role,"" the quote reads.In March, we fact-checked the exact same image Woods tweeted. At the time, we looked at her book on Google Books and searched for the quote both on Google and on Lexis-Nexis.We did not find the quote then, and we didn’t this time after re-doing the search. The Clinton campaign declined to comment. We found quotes from the book making the opposite point.""Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters — to feed them, to sing them to sleep, to teach them to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop spiritual lives, to make countless daily decisions that determine whom they have the potential to become,"" the book says on page four.The word ""secondary"" does not even show up in the book, our search showed.""But I was also blessed with caring neighbors, attentive doctors, challenging public schools, safe streets, and an economy that supported my father’s job,"" she wrote. ""Much of my family’s good fortune was beyond my parents’ direct control, but not beyond the control of other adults whose actions affected my life.""She does not say, however, that ""parents have a secondary role,"" as Woods alleged.Paul Kengor, a professor of political science at Grove City College and a Ronald Reagan biographer, said there is a typical divide in how conservatives and liberals (such as Clinton) view child care. He said it was conceivable Clinton would support a primary role for the state due to her liberal persuasion.William Chafe, a history professor at Duke University, disagreed. He said the book's message was to uphold a community commitment to the well-being of women and children, not to shift responsibility, calling the latter a ""willful misreading.""What societal role is too much is for readers to decide, but the quote is fabricated.Our rulingWoods claimed that Clinton wrote that ""the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump Jr. says unemployment rates are manipulated for political purposes,"Are the unemployment numbers being manipulated to make the Obama administration look good?Trump was making a point frequently made by his father — that the official unemployment rate is lower than it should be because it doesn't take into account the people who would like a job but have stopped looking.""The way we actually measure unemployment is after x number of months if someone can't find a job, congratulations, they're miraculously off,"" he said. ""That doesn't count"" in the calculation.""These are artificial numbers,"" Trump continued. ""These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster. ... Those are the people we want to put to work""He's correct that the widely-reported unemployment number doesn't capture the full employment picture. But for this check, we'll talk about whether the numbers are massaged to make the economy look better than it is.The unemployment rate is developed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based in part on data from interviews of about 60,000 households conducted by the Census Bureau  As Trump Jr. indicated, it only includes people who have recently looked for a job.But that's the way it's consistently been done for decades. Alternative methods have their own limitations.Allegations of manipulationTwo problems: Buckmon had left the bureau by 2012, and he told the paper he was never told to sway the statistic in favor of Obama.A typical worker handles data from 35 to 55 of the 60,000 or so households surveyed. And the bureau routinely double-checks its findings by having households re-interviewed by a different person in an attempt to look for inconsistencies that might point to manipulation.The report said: ""It would have taken 78 Census Bureau Field Representatives working together, in a coordinated way, to report each and every unemployed person included in their sample as 'employed' or 'not in labor force' during September 2012"" to produce that kind of manipulation.Artificial numbers?Other experts joined Baker in dismissing the younger Trump’s allegation about the standard unemployment rate.""The same basic definition of the unemployment rate has been used (with minor changes) going back almost all the way to World War II, under both Republican and Democratic administrations,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.""This measure has been consistently produced following the same basic methodology in the U.S. and copied around the world for over 50 years,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University.And what about Trump's complaint that the numbers are skewed by not including people who have given up looking for work?By that statistic, the economy is not as healthy as the conventional unemployment estimate would indicate.Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said it's fair for the younger Trump to dispute the standard unemployment rate as an indicator of economic performance because the labor market has not gained the type of strength you would expect with the current unemployment rate.It's a question of which BLS data to use ""rather than the competence of the BLS per se,"" he said.But Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the important thing ""is to be consistent across time in which measure you use. It wouldn't be right to switch from looking at the conventional rate to a measure that includes discouraged workers just because you don't like the incumbent president and want to make things look bad for him.""Other experts were more blunt.Trump’s comment ""is a reprise of the same nonsense his father floated a few months ago. It is yet another conspiracy theory that the Trumps have grabbed onto,"" said Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor.The limitations of the unemployment number are well known, he said. ""Everyone who reads an article in a decent newspaper about the employment picture each month reads about discouraged workers, part-time workers, and so on.""""There are plenty of grounds for us nerd-types to complain about the accuracy of the BLS numbers,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. ""No survey is perfect and there will always be issues with how a survey is conducted and questions are posed. But the idea that BLS cooks numbers is beyond ridiculous.""Our rulingTrump Jr. said that unemployment numbers ""are artificial numbers. These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster.""The economists with whom we spoke said Trump is wrong to question the integrity of the federal unemployment data.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrong that Tim Kaine took more gifts than Bob McDonnell ,"Donald Trump welcomed U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., to the Democratic presidential ticket on Sunday by assailing the presumptive vice presidential nominee’s ethics.That’s a big claim, because McDonnell, a Republican, stood trial for accepting $177,000 in undisclosed personal gifts from an entrepreneur who was seeking business with the state. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned McDonnell’s bribery convictions in June.""Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what Kaine took,"" said Trump, the GOP presidential nominee. ""And I think, to me, it’s a big problem. Now, how do you take all these gifts? Hundreds of thousands of dollars.""We wondered whether McDonnell’s gift-taking was, in fact, ""a fraction"" of Kaine’s. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for proof. So we set out on our own, comparing gifts Kaine received as lieutenant governor and governor from 2002 to 2010 to those McDonnell accepted as attorney general from 2006 to 2009 and as governor from 2010 to 2014.During those years, Virginia didn’t limit gifts to its politicians; the only requirement was that officeholders disclose what they accepted.Kaine  Most of the money was for political travel. The gifts include $45,000 that Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign paid for Kaine’s airline and lodging expenses as a surrogate speaker.Also on the list were $20,000 in travel reimbursements from Moving Virginia Forward, a PAC Kaine set up for political expenses. He listed another $11,000 in travel financed by the Democratic Party of Virginia.Kaine also accepted some personal gifts. The largest was use of a political donor’s home in the Caribbean for a vacation shortly after Kaine was elected governor in 2005. On a disclosure form, Kaine estimated the in-kind value of the lodging at $18,000.He also accepted $5,500 in clothing from Stuart Siegel, chairman of S&K Famous Brands Inc. And he accepted a variety of tickets to football and basketball games and even a concert by the Dave Matthews Band.All of these gifts were disclosed. There have been no allegations that Kaine accepted undisclosed gifts.McDonnellAccording to VPAP, McDonnell disclosed $275,707 in gifts. Of that amount, $60,293 came when he was attorney general, and $215,414 came when he was governor.  Some of the money was used for political travel, but it’s hard to get an idea of how much, because McDonnell did not consistently report the purpose for his travels. Some of the gifts also went to McDonnell’s enjoyment, including at least $34,000 in tickets and travel to Washington Redskins and University of Notre Dame football games.These gifts included a $6,000 Rolex watch; use of the businessman’s vacation home at Smith Mountain Lake; $15,000 for the catering bill at the wedding of McDonnell’s oldest daughter, as well as a $10,000 wedding check to her; and a designer gown for McDonnell’s wife.All told, McDonnell’s disclosed and undisclosed gifts come to $452,707.Our rulingTrump, speaking about gift-taking, said, ""Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what (Tim) Kaine took.""Kaine accepted $162,083 in gifts as lieutenant governor and governor, all of which was disclosed as required by state law.McDonnell disclosed accepting $275,707 in gifts as attorney general and governor. And there was another $177,000 that he didn’t disclose. That comes to a total of $452,707 in gifts - almost three times Kaine’s total.Trump has got this one dead wrong.

They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone - including the middle class.So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges - not just the middle class but everyone.Who were the two resisters?We searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty.We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries.

PANTS-FIRE,Pants on Fire for claim Ted Cruz never denied father photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald,"Donald Trump, fresh off triumphantly accepting the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland, surprisingly revived an explosive unfounded tale related to someone with no chance of beating him in November.At a rally, Trump initially told supporters he doesn’t want the backing of Cruz, whose convention speech two days earlier drew boos for not including a Trump endorsement; the Texan did offer congratulations. Next, Trump resurrected his unconfirmed claim about Oswald and Rafael Cruz, the senator’s father, possibly knowing one another.Trump said: ""All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead he said, ‘Donald Trump.’ I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that frankly, in many respects, should be very respected.""There was no evidence the man next to Oswald in the black-and-white photo published in the Enquirer was the elder Cruz. Notably, facial recognition experts advised that no such match could be made; meantime, historians found no corroborating records. The Enquirer never said how it determined the man in the photo with Oswald was Rafael Cruz.Could it still be that Sen. Cruz never denied his father was in the photo?To our inquiry on this point, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out a statement the Cruz campaign gave to the McClatchy News Service in April 2016 at the time the photo in question was printed on the Enquirer’s cover.  Cruz said the Enquirer ""just spread lies, blatant lies"" and described the article as ""this idiotic story about JFK.""""I was never in New Orleans at that time,"" he said.Our rulingTrump said the day after the Republican convention that Cruz ""never denied"" his father was pictured with Oswald before Kennedy’s assassination.This spring, Cruz called the National Enquirer story ""lies.""  Earlier, a Cruz camp spokeswoman said outright the elder Cruz wasn’t in the published photo.That's far enough from ""never denied,"" it makes Trump's claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Obama is not 'absolutely' a Muslim, as RNC speaker claims","President Barack Obama is a Christian, but that doesn’t stop people from saying he’s a Muslim.""I don't believe the guy is a Christian,"" Sabato said. ""He has never talked about Jesus Christ once.""""We had a Muslim president for seven and half years,"" Sabato added.This claim will, too.Our fact-checking shows clear evidence that Obama is a Christian. According to Obama’s memoirs and independent biographies, Obama was not raised in any particular faith. He became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor.""It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith,"" Obama said in a 2006 speech. ""It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.""The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in the 2008 presidential campaign, after video of some of Wright's more controversial sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine.After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended to find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.So why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? A benign explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion want to associate him with something they perceive to be negative.None of it, however, makes the claim correct.Our rulingSabato said Obama is ""absolutely"" a Muslim.That’s wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,Law enforcement lobbyist says pro-police speech is 'markedly absent' from Obama,"After five police officers were killed in an attack in Dallas, critics targeted President Barack Obama’s rhetoric on policing and police brutality.""I think one of the big differences then was you had governors and mayors and the president — whether it was President Johnson or President Nixon, Republican or Democrat — condemning violence against the police and urging support for the police.""Today that's markedly absent,"" Johnson continued. ""I think that's a huge difference, and that's directly led to the climate that allows these attacks to happen.""Johnson says that Obama has not supported the police or condemned violence against them. That’s a serious charge, and a quick look at the public record shows this isn’t true.Johnson’s comment came before Obama announced he would attend a July 12 memorial for the fallen police officers.What Obama has saidWe’ll start with what he said after the murders of the Dallas officers July 7.""As I told Mayor (Mike) Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas,"" Obama said.""And so, to all of law enforcement, I want to be very clear: We know you have a tough job. We mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives,"" Obama said.That’s just what Obama has said on this topic in the past week.""My heart goes out to the police officers who were injured in the past few days. They showed extraordinary restraint ... it shows how tough a job policing can be,"" Obama said.""I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City,"" Obama said. ""Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day.""Here are several other examples:NAPO’s complaintsThe NAPO account of the meeting has the president asking how he could have better responded to police shootings.Johnson said the administration had failed to address violence and threats against police that he linked to Black Lives Matter. In his account — much more measured than Johnson’s critique on Fox — Johnson acknowledged that the administration had condemned violence against police officers, but he said it had only done so after officers had been killed.""There has been no response, no condemnation when Black Lives Matter protests turn violent. There was no outrage when two St. Louis County police officers were shot by a Ferguson protester who was at a Black Lives Matter protest. There is no demand for accountability from the movement when members support violence towards police or even act on those calls for violence,"" NAPO’s statement reads.But this is tangentially related to the question of how Obama responded to violence against police.Looking back in timeJohnson mentioned presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson as models of presidents who had police officers’ backs.Johnson, Nixon and Obama’s shared support for police was typical of other presidents and politicians, according to Jeremy Mayer, a professor at George Mason University who has written on presidential politics in the last half of the 20th century.""What differentiates American politicians, somewhat in the ‘60s and even more today, is the degree of sympathy which they express for the victims of police brutality,"" Mayer said. ""But even the politicians who are sympathetic to the victims of police brutality always or almost always simultaneously express support for the vast majority of police officers.""Obama has been more likely than either Nixon or Johnson, Mayer said, to combine his statements of support for the police with concerns about police brutality and discriminatory policing.Our rulingJohnson said Obama had failed to condemn violence against police.Obama has repeatedly condemned violence against police.Most recently, he expressed his support for police the night before the Dallas attack happened, amid protests over two police shootings of black men, and again after the sniper attack on police officers.Obama’s consistent objections to violence against police is similar to rhetoric by Johnson, Nixon and the vast majority of American politicians and presidents.Johnson’s statement is outrageously wrong.

PANTS-FIRE,Meme resurrects bogus claim from 2014 about Loretta Lynch helping Bill Clinton in Whitewater probe,"It shows pictures of Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, who had a controversial meeting with Lynch as his wife was under investigation by the FBI, with the words, ""Fun fact of the day. Lynch was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe.""The reason the post is wrong? It's the wrong Loretta Lynch.Whitewater is the name of a failed Arkansas land deal in which Bill and Hillary Clinton were investors. When the deal was inaugurated, he was Arkansas attorney general. The developer behind the project, James McDougal, owned a savings and loan called Madison Guaranty that was also involved in the project.Complicating the affair is the fact that McDougal later hired Rose Law Firm to do some of its legal work, and one of the firm's partners was Hillary Clinton, who had, by then, become Arkansas' first lady.When billing records for the project became lost, and it turned out that Hillary Clinton was signing off on those records, things looked even more suspicious.The records were eventually recovered, and no charges were ever brought against the Clintons despite numerous investigations. The land deal was a bust — the Clintons sold their share in the project to McDougal for $1,000 in 1992, three years after Madison Guaranty failed.The Twitter post, which begins with the message ""Why does this matter?

PANTS-FIRE,Group says Colorado Senate candidate voted to take 'taxpayer-funded junket' to China. She never went,"For the second straight election, a conservative group has attacked a Democratic Colorado state Senate candidate with the same claim: ""Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China.""In late June, political mailers started arriving at homes in the northwest Denver suburbs of Senate District 19. They featured a photoshopped image of a smiling Zenzinger wearing sunglasses with dollar signs on the lenses and an ornamental Asian bridge in the background.""While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China,"" the mailer said.The back of the mailer showed a pagoda and elaborated on the claim, saying, ""Zenzinger couldn’t be trusted with taxpayer money on the city council -- we definitely can’t trust her to oversee $26 billion in the State Senate.""The same group attacked Zenzinger for a taxpayer-backed junket to China in 2014. But just as before, there are key problems with these attacks.""I’ve never been to China,"" Zenzinger told PolitiFact. ""I was joking to friends, believe me if I had been to China, I would have had so many pictures on Facebook they wouldn't have to Photoshop my picture in the ads.""Also, while on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China.Zenzinger had been appointed in 2013 to the District 19 seat to replace Democratic Sen. Evie Hudak, who resigned in the face of a recall effort by gun-rights groups angered by gun-control laws passed by Democratic lawmakers after the deadly mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in 2012.Zenzinger lost the election by 663 votes to Republican candidate Laura Woods — a defeat she blames on the misleading TV ad and mailers with the same misleading theme. Now Zenzinger is running in a rematch against Woods.""I would knock on people's doors and they'd be like, 'Oh yeah, you went to China,’ "" she said.So if there was no trip, what is the mailer talking about?A 2013 council meetingBefore the vote on the motion, the 527 group points out, Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip.The mayor said ""since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it,"" according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded.Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3.But that wasn’t the end of the meeting. The group attacking Zenzinger left out what happened next.Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, the money would come from a non-city source.  ""Councilmember Cook asked if Ms. Zenzinger is suggesting that no city costs be used in the delegation and Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger said yes,"" the minutes state. ""Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified...that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation.""Zenzinger’s motion passed on a 5-2 vote.Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found.‘Outrageous fabrications’Several people who were at the council meeting on the China delegation proposal blasted the attacks on Zenzinger.City Councilman Mark McGoff called the current mailers and the 2014 TV ad ""outrageous fabrications.""""I'm appalled by that because it besmirches Rachel Zenzinger's reputation and it's made out of whole cloth. There's just nothing there. She didn't vote to send herself on a junket and she didn't go on a junket,"" McGoff said.Just because Zenzinger voted to send a delegation doesn't mean she ""intended to use city funds,"" said Edna Gordon, president of Arvada Sister Cities.Participants paid their own way on previous sister city trips, including a 2008 delegation when two councilmembers and the city manager went to Jinzhou (before Zenzinger was on the council), Gordon said. Even the local Arvada Sister Cities group’s members paid for their trips.Williams, the mayor, has a different view of Zenzinger’s initial vote in favor of Dyer’s motion to ""send a delegation to Jinzhou.""""Did she support a motion that would have funded through city funds the opportunity for her to go? Yes, she did,"" the mayor said. But he stressed that she also made the subsequent successful motion ""with the explicit direction that no city funds be used.""""My negativity toward their ad is that it implies that she actually took that trip, and she didn’t,"" Williams said.Zenzinger disagrees with the mayor’s interpretation.""Yes, I voted to approve an ‘official’ delegation, which meant that an elected official would make the trip,"" Zenzinger said in an email. ""The funding for the delegation was not addressed until the subsequent vote.""""Mayor Williams’ comments about funding, even though they were not relevant to the original motion, prompted me to make a second motion that clarified and distinguished that this delegation would receive no funding from the city,"" Zenzinger added.Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government did not respond to additional requests for comment from PolitiFact.Our rulingIn a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, ""While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China.""As of a member of the Arvada City Council, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China.This hardly supports the political group’s accusation.

PANTS-FIRE,Pants on Fire: Trump lawyer tweets meme accusing Clinton of murder,"Donald Trump’s lawyer accused Hillary Clinton of incompetence, treason, breaking public disclosure law and murder.Cohen told us he didn’t create the meme and pointed out it’s been widely shared on social media. But virality and retweets don’t make a claim accurate, and this meme distorts the facts.Each claim is either misleading or outrageously wrong. We'll explain why. ‘$6 billion lost at the State Department’The alert warned that files for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 — spanning the entirety of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 —  ""were incomplete or could not be located at all.""""Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,"" he wrote. ""Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — ‘creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions.’ ""In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It’s akin to spending $20 on lunch and losing or not asking for a receipt. Documentation over where that $20 went was lost, but not the $20 itself.So the State Department under Clinton, who wasn’t mentioned in the alert, may have been financially disorganized, but it didn’t ""lose"" $6 billion.‘Sold uranium to the Russia through my faux charity’The State Department didn’t unilaterally greenlight Russia’s purchase of a company with U.S. uranium assets. It was one of nine government agencies, along with federal and state nuclear regulators, that approved the deal. Moreover, there is no evidence that Clinton personally advocated for approval.Nine people related to the company did give to the Clinton Foundation at some point in time, but most of their donations occurred before the Russian deal.Cohen’s meme is a more outlandish. Given the available evidence, the most that can be said is the State Department had a hand in the approval process, and Clinton Foundation donors were linked to the company Russia purchased. That may look fishy, but there’s no proof of quid pro quo.‘Illegally deleted public records’But was this illegal? It depends, according to Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation.""If Clinton destroyed work emails knowing they should have been kept and was intentionally trying to remove them from the public record, then yes, that is illegal and it is a crime,"" he said. ""In the end, I think there is not enough public information available to know whether Clinton did ‘illegally’ destroy public records.""""The whole situation also again raises questions about the process by which Clinton decided what was, and was not, a federal record, a process she enshrouded in a black box of attorney-client privilege when she involved her personal attorneys, and a process she made final when she destroyed anything they determined was ‘personal,’"" Cox said.Ultimately, Clinton hasn’t been charged with any crime at the time of Cohen’s tweet.‘Murdered an ambassador’It’s one thing to say Clinton and other top government officials should shoulder some responsibility for the institutional failure that contributed to the inadequate response to the Benghazi attacks, but it’s ridiculous to accuse Clinton of murder.Our rulingCohen tweeted a meme that says Clinton ""presided over $6 billion lost at the State Department, sold uranium to the Russians through (her) faux charity, illegally deleted public records, and murdered an ambassador.""There are significant problems with each part of the post.During Clinton’s tenure at as secretary of state, the department was reprimanded for shoddy paperwork affecting $6 billion worth of contracts, not ""losing"" the money.The Clinton Foundation did not sell uranium to the Russians. Clinton’s State Department approved Russia’s purchase of a company with uranium assets in the United States but it was one of 11 organizations to do so. There’s no evidence that she personally advocated for the deal, nor is there evidence that people related to the company who donated to the Clinton Foundation did so on a quid pro quo basis.Clinton deleted over 30,000 emails off her private email server without government review. Experts say that’s certainly skirting the rules and her email server in general was not allowed. But to say that it was ""illegal"" takes it too far, at least for now.Finally, terrorists murdered the U.S. ambassador. None of the seven probes into the Benghazi attacks held Clinton personally responsible for the ambassador’s death, let alone charge her with murder.

PANTS-FIRE,"What do we know about Hillary Clinton's religion? A lot, actually","Donald Trump has once again questioned a presidential candidate’s religious affiliation, accusing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of shielding her religious preference from the public eye.""We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,"" Trump said in the video. ""Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no — there's nothing out there. There’s like nothing out there.""At the gathering, Trump also made the broader claim that Clinton would not protect religious liberty.""We can’t be again politically correct and say we pray for all our leaders, because all of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tubes, selling evangelicals down the tubes,"" he said.So, what does Clinton have to say about her religion? A lot, we found out.On the campaign trailLet’s get this out of the way: Clinton is a Methodist, and the record on that is abundantly clear.""Because it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don’t have a lot but who have the spirit that God recognizes as being at the core of love and salvation,"" she said.She went on to criticize those who use Christianity to ""condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.""""You know, my family and my faith taught me a simple credo — do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, for all the people you can,"" she said.She called upon her personal spirituality during her unsuccessful 2008 bid for president.Clinton has definitely brought up her religious background on the campaign trail this time around to convey both her political and personal philosophies. However, the intended message has not always hit home with voters.Formative yearsReligion has played a large role in Clinton’s life even before ""there was any political advantage to do so,"" said Patrick Maney, a Bill Clinton biographer and professor of history at Boston College.""He taught me the meaning of the words ‘faith in action’ and the importance of social justice and human rights,"" she said at the time.In the conservative community of Park Ridge, Jones was considered to be more liberal and a free thinker, occasionally drawing ire for it. Jones made it a point to teach Clinton how ""Jesus would deal with social issues,"" said William Chafe, a professor of history at Duke University who has studied Clinton extensively.""He took Hillary and the youth group into the slums of Chicago, had them interact with poor blacks and Puerto Ricans, and brought them to hear (Martin Luther King, Jr.) preach,"" Chafe said. ""Even though her father was a Goldwater Republican.""""Though my eyes were opening, I still mostly parroted the conventional wisdom of Park Ridge’s and my father’s politics,"" she wrote. ""While Don Jones threw me into ‘liberalizing’ experiences, Paul Carlson … reinforced my already strong anti-communist views.""Her critics have actually used her relationship with Jones against her as a ""radicalizing influence,"" Maney said. However, even after leaving for Wellesley College, the two kept in touch.She continued to attend church at Wellesley, and Chafe noted that her social justice pursuits meshed with her religious convictions once she got to Yale as well.""She immediately identified with Marion Wright Edelman's Children's Defense Fund at Yale and worked with them after graduating from Yale,"" Chafe said. The group advocated for family rights.The trend continues after moving to Arkansas in the 1970s, where she taught Sunday school at the First United Methodist Church, Maney said.Clinton also attended the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington as first lady. Kengor told PolitiFact she was considered a ""regular"" at the church, which is considered to be more liberal than the larger Methodist denomination.Bill Clinton is a Baptist, not a Methodist. Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, was raised a Methodist.In her own wordsClinton has said that ""advertising"" her faith publicly is not her first instinct. Chafe noted she has relied on it less extensively in the recent past.Nonetheless, she has expounded on her faith in several public comments and books since entering the national spotlight with the election of her husband as president in 1992.In the same book, she describes meeting her ""prayer partners"" at the 1993 National Prayer Breakfast, and the gifts of Scripture they provided her.""Of all the thousands of gifts I received in my eight years in the White House, few were more welcome and needed than these 12 intangible gifts of discernment, peace, compassion, faith, fellowship, vision, forgiveness, grace, wisdom, love, joy and courage,"" she wrote.""We are only children of God, not God. Therefore, we must not attempt to fit God into little boxes, claiming that He supports this or that political position,"" she wrote.""I’ll always cherish the Methodist Church because it gave us the great gift of personal salvation, but the great obligation of social gospel, and for me, having faith, hope, and love in action was exactly what we were called to do,"" she said.Our rulingTrump said, ""We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion.""The reality is we were able to find quite a lot about Clinton’s Methodist upbringing and beliefs, and how she says it ties into her political philosophy. We documented just some of what we found here, and experts agree there is more out there.Trump’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump flubs claim that Hillary Clinton deleted her support of trade deal from her book,"Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of trying to delete part of her personal history during a June 22, 2016, speech that focused in part on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.""Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas — and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission,"" Trump said. ""Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.""She has even deleted this record of total support from her book,"" he said, adding, ""deletion is something she is very good at,"" a reference to the tens of thousands of emails she deleted on her home internet server.Did Hillary Clinton actually censor her own book to hide her past support for the trade agreement that has since come under fire?We contacted the Trump campaign asking for its facts to back up the claim. They didn't respond to our query.For starters, there is no evidence that any of Trump's comments have influenced Clinton's thoughts on the treaty.The deal was reached in October 2015, well after Clinton departed as secretary of state, and signed the following the February.The book was published in June 2014, with a deal still more than a year away.Clinton also refers to it as ""important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia.""""Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement,"" she wrote, echoing the stance she would take when Sanders criticized her support for the deal. ""It’s safe to say that the TPP won’t be perfect—no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be—but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.""So how much of this did Clinton delete from the paperback edition, which the publisher says was trimmed to accommodate the smaller size?Nothing.The pages are now renumbered as 69 and 70, but the content is the same.We found one reference to the TPP that was cut. Here it is from page 254, in a chapter dealing with Latin American issues:So we worked hard to improve and ratify trade agreements with Colombia and Panama and encouraged Canada and the group of countries that became known as the Pacific Alliance -- Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile -- all open-market democracies driving toward a more prosperous future to join negotiations with Asian nations on TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. The Alliance stood in stark contrast to Venezuela, with its more authoritarian policies and state-controlled economy.That's a description of trying to get other countries involved, not a ringing endorsement.Finally, Clinton came out in opposition to the deal after it was finalized in October 2015. By then, the paperback had been out for six months.Our rulingTrump said Hillary Clinton ""has even deleted this record of total support (for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) from her book.""The paperback removed a small reference to the TPP but the two pages that talked about it and why the agreement was important weren't deleted. The paperback edition continues to have text expressing support for the trade deal.Anyone who compares the hardcover and paperback versions of the book can see that the claim is ridiculous. We rate it Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Trump wrong that Clinton's refugee plan would cost more than rebuilding all inner cities,"A day after Hillary Clinton gave her list of Donald Trump’s many flaws on the economy, Trump returned the favor. In a speech from New York, he called her a ""world-class liar"" who has ""spent her entire life making money for special interests.""Trump delivered a broadside on Clinton’s immigration policies — to him, they represent ""mass amnesty"" and ""open borders"" — and blended those faults with her plans for refugees.""Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration,"" Trump said. ""For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.""We asked the Trump campaign where he got those spending numbers and did not hear back. But as you’ll see, whatever number Clinton could conceivably spend resettling refugees come nowhere near what it would cost to rebuild America’s urban centers.The cost of refugeesWe used that as one starting point.President Barack Obama seeks to increase the number of refugees accepted from around the world to 100,000. That includes 10,000 Syrian refugees. Clinton has said she wants to take in 65,000 Syrians. If we add her higher number to Obama’s, and we assume she wouldn’t trim his plan, we can estimate a total number of refugees of 155,000.Scaling up the dollar amounts, we can roughly estimate a total cost for her plan of about $1.3 billion. That is about half a percent of the ""hundreds of billions"" that Trump claimed.The cost of rebuilding inner citiesTrump used a term that generally refers to low-income urban neighborhoods. What he meant by rebuilding them is unclear. It could include rebuilding substandard housing, fixing aging water systems, investing in schools and job training, creating an enticing business environment, or any number of aspects of life where low-income communities are lacking.""It’s a very conservative estimate,"" Greene said. ""It only includes public housing, and that’s a small share of the low-income housing stock.""Not all public housing is in urban centers, but Greene, a housing specialist, told us that the great majority of it is.New York City alone could use billions of dollars in improvements.Researchers at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, an urban planning research center in Cambridge, Mass., found a number of estimates for different urban needs.The Federal Transit Administration estimated in 2013 that it will cost $85.9 billion to bring the nation’s transit systems to a state of good repair.The Council on Great City Schools said facility needs for schools in the 50 largest cities will cost $85 billion.The institute’s director George McCarthy estimated that it would cost $975 million just to demolish abandoned structures in Detroit.We could go further, but the numbers are clear. Barely scratching the surface of the needs of America’s cities, we find a price tag of over $225 billion.Even if Clinton doubled the Obama administration’s funding for refugees, the money would barely make a dent.Our rulingTrump said that Clinton wants to spend hundreds of billions on refugees and for that money, ""we could rebuild every inner city in America."" Trump’s campaign provided no supporting numbers.Clinton has not said how much she would spend on refugees, but the Obama administration request for FY 2017 is about $2.2 billion. That figure could increase for Clinton, as she has said she wants to take in more Syrian refugees. If it doubles or even triples, it is nowhere near ""hundreds of billions.""It is also a scant fraction of the price tag to rebuild America’s inner cities. There is no comprehensive tally of what it would take to deal with substandard housing and infrastructure, but we quickly found a backlog of about $225 billion in projects.Trump’s numbers are off by a huge margin.

PANTS-FIRE,Greg Abbott makes unfounded claim about ISIS 'running through' U.S.-Mexico border,"At the May 2016 Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Greg Abbott told thousands of delegates that the Islamic State group, which has ravaged parts of the Middle East, was at work along the Texas-Mexico border.""Our country better wake up. We’re facing an existential threat,"" he said. ""ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies.""So, here we go again.Abbott’s dataWe emailed Abbott spokesman John Wittman to ask when ISIS ran through the border, and also which Obama policies had made the border more porous, as Abbott said.The news story, citing prosecutorial documents, said a 21-year-old Minnesota man charged with conspiracy to join ISIS ""told the ISIS members about the route (‘to the U.S. through Mexico’) so that it could be used to send members to America to carry out terrorist attacks.""ISIS at the gatesFor our part, we looked first for signs of ISIS border crossings, then considered Abbott’s charge about Obama fostering a porous border.At the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for border security, including the U.S. Border Patrol, spokeswoman Marsha Catron emailed in reply: ""The suggestion that (ISIS) operatives have been apprehended at the Southwest border is not supported by facts on the ground. DHS does not have any credible intelligence that terrorist organizations are planning to attempt to cross the southwest border to carry out attacks in the United States.""That in mind, we also queried experts outside of government.We thought perhaps there are reports Manjarrez hadn’t seen, so we looked elsewhere.Nelson said: ""There’s no doubt that if ISIS had the opportunity, they would conduct an attack in the U.S., but to state that they’re going to do so by going through Mexico and going through the southern border is a little bit disconnected."" He said the group was more focused on radicalizing Americans already in the country.Clarke said ISIS would need a domestic network of safe houses and weapons stashes to wage a significant attack, even if members were to come across the border.So, no confirmed ISIS sightings.We looked next at if the border has become ""porous"" on Obama’s watch, as Abbott said.Border Patrol spending up, apprehensions downThere are no signs of a more porous border that we divined.When we asked Nelson at the CSIS to what extent border security had decreased under Obama, he said, ""I would say it hasn’t."" He said, ""The amount of resources Obama has put forward to secure the border has been significant.""On Obama’s watch, federal figures suggest, border security spending and staffing escalated and, in the latest full fiscal year, 2015, apprehensions of individuals crossing the border without legal authority declined in comparison to the three previous years.Some perspective:--The 17,522 Border Patrol agents in 2015 were up a sliver, less than 1 percent, from 2009, though down 6 percent from the all-time high of 18,611 agents in 2013.Obama policies?We asked Manjarrez if DACA and DAPA made the border more porous.

For instance, he said that many children who arrived amid a surge in 2014-2015 cited rumors that they would not be deported as a motivation for their trips to the border. The increased ""clutter"" at the border, he said, made it harder for Border Patrol agents to pinpoint security threats.experts and news reports gave more credit to rising violence in Central American countries and to a 2008 law passed under Bush shielding non-Mexican children from immediate deportation when apprehended at the border.Abbott againWe shared our findings--no confirmation of ISIS on the border and statistics suggesting a greater security presence--with the governor’s office. Wittman said Abbott had nothing to add.Our rulingAbbott said ""ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies.""We found no factual basis — Abbott offered none — to support the claim that ISIS is ""running through"" the border. Other claims of ISIS forces marshaling on the U.S.-Mexico border have been debunked, and this one deserves the same fate. Border security itself has been stepped up, by the federal government and Texas, with apprehensions lately on the decline.Abbott’s claim isn’t just wrong, it’s ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump suggests Barack Obama supported ISIS, but that's a conspiracy theory","In a series of comments designed to cast doubt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has charged that the Obama administration has actively supported the Islamic extremist group that became ISIS.In this fact-check, we’ll begin by recapping what Trump said. Then we’ll look at whether he has any evidence to support the allegation. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)What Trump saidThen, on June 14, Trump told the Associated Press that Obama ""claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people.""The 2012 intelligence memoThe document outlines what is known about ""the general situation"" on the ground in Syria and Iraq after the rebellion against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. In that context, the document refers, among other groups, to al-Qaida in Iraq, or AQI, which eventually morphed into ISIS,  sometimes called the Islamic State or ISIL. The document calls AQI one of a few ""major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.""Specifically, it said, ""AQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning, both ideologically and through the media. AQI declared its opposition (to) Assad’s government because it considered it a sectarian regime targeting Sunnis."" (As background, AQI and ISIS are part of the Sunni branch of Islam, which is often in conflict with the Shia branch.)Meanwhile, the document said that ""the West, Gulf countries and Turkey support the opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the regime.""The significance of the memoTrump sees the memo as the smoking gun that demonstrates U.S. support for ISIS or its predecessor group. But that’s not the case.Rather, experts say it means that the United States shared an overarching goal with the opposition -- namely, countering Assad -- without actively supporting all elements of that opposition. In the byzantine world of the Syrian opposition, the United States sought to support moderate elements while opposing extremists such as AQI and, later, ISIS.The White House firmly rejected the notion that the United States actively supported either AQI or ISIS, noting the number of terrorists the administration has killed, including major leadership figures.""We, in conjunction with our Iraqi partners, relentlessly pursued and ultimately degraded AQI with every tool in our arsenal -- including military force,"" said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council. ""And, of course, the fact that we eliminated AQI's leader, Abu Ayyub al-Masri in a joint U.S.-Iraqi raid leaves no doubt about our determination to rid Iraq of this group.""Independent experts agreed with the White House.""The United States has never backed AQI and has never backed ISIS,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. ""It was never part of the opposition that the United States supported, full stop.""Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. ""It has never been the policy or stated goal of the Obama administration to arm or assist al-Qaida,"" he said.""I would say it's another unsupportable conspiracy theory,"" said John Limbert, an international affairs professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who previously served as a foreign service officer in post-war Iraq and as deputy coordinator for counterterrorism in the State Department.A point Trump could have made, but didn’tIronically, experts say, Trump could have made a different point against the Obama administration's Syria policy.Specifically, the policy of arming and promoting Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime ended up indirectly helping the al Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, Landis said.Al Nusra was ""allied with many of the leaders that the U.S. did arm or assist,"" Landis said. And other rebel groups were overrun by al Nusra, he added, even having to surrender their U.S.-provided arms to the al-Qaida affiliate on occasion.The difference with what Trump said is that these developments were unintended -- and unwanted -- side effects of the United States’ policy, not a goal of it.""I think our policy has been both foolish and tragic, but it doesn’t make the argument from Breitbart true,"" Gartenstein-Ross said.Our rulingTrump said ""the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State.""U.S. efforts to court ""moderate"" opponents of Assad may have benefited other Islamic extremist groups such as al Nusra, but any such benefits were an unintended consequence of U.S. policy, not a goal of that policy itself.That’s different from the argument made by Trump -- that the U.S. was actively supporting ISIS or its predecessors. In fact, experts say that assertion is flat wrong. The implication that the Obama administration was actively helping the United States' enemies is ridiculous. It has always been U.S. policy to oppose AQI and ISIS, and the United States has aggressively fought the group for years. We rate Trump’s assertion Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Pants On Fire for viral rumor Bernie Sanders won California,"But early results on Election Day showed Clinton crushing Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. That gap closed steadily as officials tallied more votes (to 12.6 points as of midafternoon June 10, 2016), but remained large enough for media outlets and professional pollsters to declare Clinton the winner.Still, there are those who point to millions of uncounted ballots in the state, and say Sanders was robbed. Justice Gazette, a group that describes itself as a counter to traditional media, is one of them.There’s no doubt Sanders ran a strong race in California. But the Gazette’s claim seemed outlandish and ripe for a fact check.Our researchOnce they are, pollsters expect the gap to narrow, but not close.Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, told PolitiFact California he does not think Clinton’s lead is in jeopardy.Clinton’s lead ""might go down into the single digits, but it’s still going to be a Clinton win,"" DiCamillo said.DiCamillo estimated Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by roughly a 2 to 1 margin to overtake Clinton.""You’re smoking something if you think that’s going to happen,"" he added.Of the Justice Gazette claim of two-thirds of Sanders’ votes being uncounted, DiCamillo said ""nobody can claim to know that.""Neither during his speech in Santa Monica on election night, nor since, has Sanders protested the California results. A representative for the Sanders campaign said it had no affiliation with the Justice Gazette story.""No one’s questioning the fundamental integrity of the election,"" Ben Tulchin, Sanders’ national pollster, told PolitiFact California, in an interview on June 10, 2016.Tulchin added that the campaign believes California can do more to make it easier for independents to vote in a Democratic primary.The Sanders pollster said the campaign expects the California ""race to close substantially,"" perhaps ""to low single digits,"" once all the votes are counted.As for overtaking Clinton’s lead, Tulchin said ""there’s a small chance.

There are more than two million uncounted votes. But based on polling shortly before the race, showing Sanders even or slightly ahead with voters who had yet to cast ballots, professional pollsters and news outlets say Clinton’s lead could shrink somewhat but is not in danger.

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump said, 'Crime is rising.' It's not (and hasn't been for decades)","After big primaries in California and New Jersey on June 7, Donald Trump -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- painted a picture of a nation in crisis.But the line from Trump’s remarks that leapt out at us was this one: ""Crime is rising."" Our previous research has shown that’s not so. So we took a closer look. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)We looked at two broad categories of crime -- violent crime and property crime -- that are frequently cited by experts as catch-all categories. Violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, while property crimes include burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.First, we looked at the trend for violent crime and found that it has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available.Next, we looked at property crime data. It showed the same pattern:Here, the trend looks quite similar:Finally, we asked two criminologists to make sure we weren’t missing something. As it happens, James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, was watching Trump’s speech and noticed the comment as well.""He is incorrect,"" Fox said. ""There are some spikes in homicide and shootings in certain cities, yet other cities continue to experience low rates. As a nation, we are far better off than anytime for the past several decades. Crime rates are low, and there is no consistent and reliable indication that things are getting worse.""""Mr. Trump is wrong if he is talking about overall crime and even violent crime,"" agreed University of Maryland criminologist Raymond Paternoster. Any possible upward swing in the past year or so wouldn’t show up in the data currently available, he said.Our rulingSpeaking generally about the state of the country, Trump said, ""Crime is rising.""If you look at overall violent and property crimes -- the only categories that would seem inclusive enough to qualify as ""crime,"" as Trump put it -- he is flat wrong. In fact, crime rates have been falling almost without fail for roughly a quarter-century. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.Our fact-check acknowledged the point made in the post, although this data is preliminary and subject to revision. Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend. In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trump’s statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline. Trump didn’t say that crime was rising ""recently"" or ""in recent months"" or ""over the past year"" or ""in some places."" Ultimately, we find that Trump’s sweeping rhetoric about a nation in decline and beset by crime ignores the overall trend of violent and property crime rates over the past 25 years, which is that they have fallen, consistently and significantly.

PANTS-FIRE,Rating Katie McGinty’s curious campaign college claim,"Katie McGinty comes from a working class upbringing, as she routinely tells voters. The senate candidate was the ninth of 10 kids of a restaurant hostess and a police officer. She grew up in Rhawnhurst. She’s hosted numerous campaign events at diners.But what’s drawn the most scrutiny over the last few days are the statements she’s made about college. The third paragraph on the about page of McGinty’s website touts a claim we often hear about candidates from less privileged upbringings: ""She was the first in her family to go to a four-year college."" Keep an eye on that phrasing.McGinty graduated from St. Joseph’s in 1985, according to a list of notable alumni from the university, and started there in 1981, according to her LinkedIn page.  Through campaign spokesperson Josh Levitt, brother John provided this statement: ""The way that Katie and our family have always talked about our experience is she was the first of the 10 McGinty kids to attend and graduate from a four-year college, straight out of high school. We were all really proud of that, just as we were proud that I earned my degree by completing a two-year program and then enrolling in La Salle.""  Our rulingU.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty’s campaign website claims she was first person in her family to go to a four-year college. She’s elided this statement further through the course of her campaign.John took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school.

PANTS-FIRE,Dog meat: Regional treat or global health threat?,"Every June, the city of Yulin in China’s southwestern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region hosts a spectacle that has drawn international condemnation.  An estimated 10,000 dogs are butchered as part of a dog meat festival that started about six years ago.Action is needed, the resolution continued, because the Dog Meat Festival in Yulin ""threatens global public health.""We are not insensitive to how ugly the scene might well be in Yulin.But our focus is on whether this festival in itself poses a threat to global public health.Hastings spokesman Evan Polisar sent us a statement that said ""anything that happens in China has global significance, positively or negatively, due to China's enormous size."" The statement noted that rabies kills about 2,000 people a year in China. People who handle the dogs are most at risk of contracting rabies by being bitten or scratched.""Since rabies is deadly and the number in China is so big, a reduction of that number is a global accomplishment,"" Polisar told us in an email.The statement from Hastings’ office also mentioned the potential for food contamination at restaurants that serve dog meat.Perhaps, but that falls well short of describing a global health threat, officials at the World Health Organization told us.Put simply, you may reject the dog festival as being cruel to animals or unethical, but you shouldn’t suggest it poses a global health threat.""While much can be said from the ethics and animal welfare points of view, we’re not aware of scientifically justified arguments behind the claim that a dog meat festival in China or the practice of eating dog meat represent a global threat to public health,"" said Dr. Kazuaki Miyagishima, director of WHO’s Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases. ""While it may pose a potential public health issue within China because of the lack of compliance with existing regulations, this would have no or very limited international impact.""Dog meat is eaten primarily in countries in Asia, although it is also reported in some places in Africa. This map shows the nations most commonly mentioned in news reports.Hastings’ resolution also mentioned cholera, but China reported no outbreaks of cholera in 2014 and while there was one between 2010 and 2013, it occurred far away in another part of China to the north and east of Yulin.We could find no survey of global health threats that made any reference to dog meat or the dog meat trade. Worldwide, rabies kills about 60,000 people a year, about a third of them in India. HIV/Aids and tuberculosis, clear global health threats, each kill over a million people annually.There are reports from China and Africa that dog slaughter is particularly cruel because some believe that the meat tastes sweeter if the animal dies in pain. The moral objections are obvious. The government of Yulin has distanced itself from the festival and moved to limit it.Our rulingHastings said in his resolution that the dog meat festival in Yulin, China threatens global public health. No evidence backs that up. A leading expert at the World Health Organization dismissed the idea, both for the festival in particular, and the practice of eating dog meat in general. Peer-reviewed studies in China find little connection between the dog meat trade and rabies.There may be other reasons to condemn the festival, but the risk it poses to public health globally is not one of them.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

We weren’t fighting amateurs; we were fighting a vicious enemy armed by Iran,"" Keyser says.Then he pivots to the claim we’re fact-checking: ""Now Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it.""Keyser is among five Republicans vying to win the June 28 primary and the right to take on Bennet in the general election.He’s not the only Republican attacking a Democratic opponent this election season on the Iran deal, which the Obama administration and five other nations approved in 2015.Those Democrats did support the deal, but the intention was clearly not to allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. When we rechecked the terms for this fact-check, we found that was still the case.We contacted the Keyser campaign. A spokesman did not provide evidence to back up the claim.The deal’s termsThe deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years.A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb.  To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be.Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes.A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s ""breakout time"" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal.""It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. ""It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days.""Our rulingKeyser said, ""Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it.""Keyser portrays the agreement as a plot to arm Iran with nukes when it’s designed to do exactly the opposite.The terms of the deal forbid Iran from pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must allow inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal).It's ridiculous to say Obama and Bennet wanted this deal because they want to give Iran a nuclear weapon. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c9edf88f-91bb-450c-82cf-14dacd88c0e3"

And Gingrich would have been on firmer ground had he stuck to the narrative of Trump's ascension rather than focusing on the timeline.But the speed at which Trump went from his announcement at Trump Tower to becoming the GOP standard bearer isn’t a remarkable achievement.That’s a span of 346 days, if you include May 26.We didn’t have too look too far to find shorter spans for non-incumbents.John Kerry in 2004George W.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrong that Hillary Clinton wants to release all violent criminals from prison,"""President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians,"" Trump said. He continued, ""This is Hillary Clinton's agenda, too, to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released.""We think most observers would agree that releasing every violent criminal in American prisons would amount to political suicide, not to mention bad policy. But we thought it was worth checking Clinton's actual policy prescriptions.What Trump said is far off-base. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)Existing criminal-justice reform effortsTrump said Clinton wants to continue Obama’s release of ""thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members."" But Trump overreaches both on the substance of the policy and on Obama’s personal role in enacting it.What Clinton supportsClinton does support criminal justice reform, but we found no evidence that her plan includes the release of ""violent criminals,"" much less ""all"" of them.For starters, we should note that the Sentencing Commission’s action is now a done deal. Short of calling on the commission to reverse itself -- which the panel, being independent, could simply ignore -- or passing a law through Congress, there isn’t really anything Clinton (or Trump) could easily do to stop the forthcoming early releases. And of course, federal judges, not the president, are the ones who must sign off on applications for early release.More broadly, we looked at Clinton’s stated proposals for criminal justice policy and found that she focused her initiatives only on ""nonviolent"" offenders. The Clinton campaign said Trump’s comment is a misrepresentation of her views.• ""End the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons.""• ""Encourage the use of smart strategies — like police body cameras — and end racial profiling to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities.""• ""Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society.""It’s worth noting that Clinton focuses more on what happens before prison (such as sentencing of people not currently incarcerated) and after prison (especially reintegrating ex-convicts into society after they are released) than actually releasing current inmates.""Clinton has not focused on early release,"" said John H. Laub, a professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland.For a politician, this is a canny omission, because it sidesteps difficult questions about who should be released early.""There is little consensus about releasing violent criminals from prison before their terms end,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Then there is the question of who is ‘violent.’ Someone who has a prior record for a violent crime but whose current charge is for a nonviolent crime. or only those with a current charge for violence?""But even if Clinton is sidestepping a thorny issue by remaining largely silent on which, if any, inmates deserve early release, that position does throw a wrench into Trump’s accusation that it’s her stated ""agenda"" to ""release"" violent criminals.Our rulingTrump said it ""is Hillary Clinton's agenda"" to ""release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released.""It would be preposterous for any politician who wants to win an election to propose freeing every violent criminal from jail. Like many political figures today on the right, center and left, Clinton supports something much more modest — easing how the criminal justice system treats nonviolent offenders. That’s a far cry from saying Clinton is poised to set free everyone from Charles Manson to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that US is letting in 'tens of thousands' of terrorists now,"Donald Trump has advocated for a ""temporary"" ban on Muslims coming into the United States to prevent any terrorists from crossing the border. But are there already tens of thousands of terrorists coming into the country now? That’s what he claimed in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly.Still, we decided to take a closer look.On the one hand, by referring to ""vicious, violent people,"" Trump seems to be referring to terrorists and violent extremists. But there is no evidence that tens of thousands of terrorists are being admitted into the United States today -- much less that they are being ""allowed"" in, as if there is a visa preference program for terrorists.However, this would mean that Trump is saying that all or nearly all refugees are terrorists, including the many who are not even Muslim and who don’t come from the Middle East. This is decidedly not the case, experts agreed.""Donald Trump is conflating the terrorists with those who flee terror,"" said Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. ""We are not letting in terrorists, we are letting in refugees from terror. His likening refugees to terrorists is not unlike those who said German Jews from Nazi Germany should be denied immigration because they posed a security risk.""Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that is critical of illegal immigration, speculated that when Trump was referring to ""tens of thousands"" he may have been conflating the number of refugees and the much larger population of undocumented immigrants, and also conflating run-of-the-mill violent criminals with terrorists.""It is correct to say there are tens of thousands of violent criminal aliens,"" Camarota said. ""But remember the total noncitizen population who could be subject to removal is huge, and in any human population of this size there will always be tens of thousands who are criminals.""Of course, even if Trump’s statement could be manhandled into an interpretation that possessed some degree of accuracy, it was still wrong as he stated it.""Trump is certainly wrong on the facts here,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That said, Gartenstein-Ross added that more reasonable concerns could have been expressed with less ""hyperbolic"" rhetoric.The recent migrant flows from Syria and Iraq into Europe, he said, have provided greater cover for terrorists than experts had predicted early on, and while the United States is not facing as much risk from its ongoing inflow of refugees, that risk is not zero. Just going by the math, some small fraction of refugees can be expected to either be well-concealed operatives who made it through the screening process or, much more likely, people who self-radicalize after arriving in the United States.Still, Gartenstein-Ross agreed that there is no evidence that ""tens of thousands of them"" are already here, as Trump said.Our rulingTrump said, ""Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. … This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now.""There is no evidence that ""tens of thousands"" of terrorists are coming into the United States, much less that they are being ""allowed"" in on purpose. While there may be legitimate counter-terrorism concerns about refugee flows, Trump’s overheated rhetoric complicates rather than clarifies the situation. We rate the statement Pants on Fire."

However, the resolution language that leaves a door open to criminalization -- an interpretation some Muslim countries have insisted is the correct reading of the agreement -- bumped the rating to Mostly False, rather than False.Cruz goes furtherCruz’s claim is more extreme than the one PunditFact checked in 2015.

By claiming that the resolution would ""make discussion of radical Islamic terrorism illegal,"" Kayaoglu said, Cruz is interpreting the resolution in the same way as Islamic states, rather than through the understanding emphasized by the U.S. and E.U.When member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation attempt to criminalize blasphemy, they usually are focused on ""things like defaming Muhammad,"" Kayaoglu said.

PANTS-FIRE,Pat McCrory says Springsteen canceled North Carolina show after poor ticket sales,"Gov. Pat McCrory took shots at critics of North Carolina’s controversial new law, commonly known as HB2, during a morning radio appearance May 3 on The John Boy and Billy Big Show.The law banned transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify as, banned cities from enacting their own minimum wages or LGBT-friendly discrimination laws and got rid of anyone’s ability to file a discrimination lawsuit in state court.It was widely panned by progressive politicians as well as entertainers, some of whom even canceled shows in the Tar Heel State.On the show McCrory, with encouragement from John Boy and Billy, went through a laundry list of critics he said were mistaken or hypocritical.The show’s titular hosts – two down-home comedians with a conservative bent – are based in Charlotte and are broadcast in the morning rush hour throughout the country, primarily on rock stations.So it was no surprise that Bruce Springsteen’s name was brought up – although it was McCrory, not the hosts, who broached the subject of the rocker who is arguably the biggest name to have canceled a show in North Carolina over the new law.""Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry – which is happening as I write – is one of them,"" Springsteen wrote April 8 in announcing the decision to cancel his April 10 show.McCrory, however, implied that perhaps The Boss doesn’t command the adoration he once did – and that his cancellation was actually a ploy to avoid the embarrassing optics of a half-empty concert.""I love Bruce Springsteen,"" McCrory said. ""I love his music. But he canceled a concert in Greensboro. By the way, they only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect. Hmm. But Bruce doesn’t mention that. They didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted.""That got a hearty laugh from everyone on set, and McCrory later repeated that 8,000 number.Where'd he hear that?The Greensboro Coliseum, where he had been scheduled to play, can seat more than 20,000 people. Stadium officials said the capacity for the Springsteen concert was actually about 16,000 due to stage and seating logistics.So that 8,000 number, if true, would say a lot about Springsteen – especially keeping in mind that the Coliseum tracks attendance for all of its shows, and Bruuuuuuuuuuuce has two of the 20 largest crowds in stadium history.But those were years ago, in 2002 and 2009. Is McCrory right that North Carolinians in 2016 don’t care much for the Jersey rocker’s music, much less his liberal views? Was he really only using a convenient political stance to cover up embarrassing sales numbers?No, according to the Greensboro Coliseum.Andrew Brown, the arena’s PR director, told us Springsteen had sold more than 15,000 tickets.""No idea where 8,000 may have come from,"" Brown said, adding that there were fewer than 100 tickets left when Springsteen canceled with two days’ notice.""It’s safe to say it would have sold out,"" he said.Like Brown, we also have no idea where the 8,000 number came from. McCrory’s campaign hasn’t responded to our questions, but we’ll update this if we hear back.The Greensboro Coliseum previously reported that Springsteen’s cancellation cost it $100,000.As for Springsteen, the more-than-15,000-tickets number is the same figure the coliseum reported immediately after the cancellation, which was weeks before McCrory questioned the attendance. We appreciate the consistency, which keeps us from dancing in the dark to try to figure out the truth.Our rulingMcCrory was way off on the number of tickets sold, which was widely reported before his radio appearance. What's more, he used that incorrect number to suggest that was why Springsteen canceled. In fact, the arena said the show was on the verge of selling out, not half empty.That’s not just false – ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, it’s on fire. Pants on Fire!UPDATE: McCrory apologizesThe night after our fact-check went up, we heard back from Pat McCrory’s office about his claim that only 8,000 tickets had been sold.Although he’s standing by another claim he made – that he loves Springsteen’s music – McCrory admitted he was wrong about the sales figure and that it was the reason for the cancellation.""The governor apologizes for using the wrong number,"" wrote his spokesman, Josh Ellis, in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. ""It’s too bad Bruce Springsteen actually canceled on nearly 15,000 people at the last minute.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim linking Ted Cruz's father and JFK assassination,"Straight from the grocery aisle tabloids ... Donald Trump is linking Ted Cruz's father to the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.Is it true that Rafael Cruz ""was with"" Oswald before the assassination, or was Trump’s bombshell accusation itself ridiculous?The 1963 photo at left shows Lee Harvey Oswald (left) and an unidentified man who the National Enquirer claims is Rafael Cruz, the father of Ted Cruz. A verified image of Cruz (in 1959 wearing glasses) is at right. Dubious photographic evidenceWe could not independently verify these experts’ validation, as neither Goldstone nor Lieberman got back to us.""Without such images, no professional face examiner will be willing to render an opinion,"" he said.Would Cruz and Oswald have even run in the same circles? NoCruz eventually applied to universities in the United States, was accepted by the University of Texas, and left by ferry to Key West, where he made his way to Austin. He attended classes and worked as a dishwasher, a story his son would often repeat on the campaign trail.Back in Cuba, Batista fled under pressure from Castro’s forces, and Castro assumed power at the beginning of 1959. Later that year, during Cruz’s summer break from college, he returned to Cuba and was ""shocked"" by the nation’s turn to communism. He left, never to return, leaving close relatives behind.In the spring of 1962, Cruz writes, he accepted a job with IBM in Dallas, where he lived for a time with his wife and two daughters from his first marriage. At some point, Cruz moved to New Orleans to take a different job, although the timeline is unclear from his book. It was in New Orleans that Cruz met his second wife, Eleanor. They had a son, the future presidential candidate, in 1970, in the Canadian city of Calgary.So Cruz checks a couple of boxes relevant to Oswald -- a stay in New Orleans (where Oswald had lived and where the photograph in question was taken), a period in Dallas (where Oswald also lived, and where he assassinated Kennedy), and an interest in Cuba.But there is nothing to suggest that this is anything more than simple coincidence. Indeed, historians of the period say that it’s unlikely that someone like Cruz would have palled around with someone like Oswald.Cruz would have already been a staunch anti-communist for several years by the time he was allegedly photographed with Oswald. Given that Oswald was handing out leaflets for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee -- a pro-Castro group -- a partnership between the two men would make no sense on its face.Moreover, it’s believed that Oswald in this period was more of a lone wolf than an organization man. The Warren Commission report examining Kennedy’s assassination quoted Marina Oswald, his widow, saying ""that her husband engaged in Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities ‘primarily for purposes of self-advertising. He wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the newspapers, so that he would be known.’ ""In other words, whatever Oswald was doing pamphleting on that day in New Orleans was likely a freelance effort to ""provoke something"" that would get him attention, Gosse said. Tying Cruz to the photograph as an associate of Oswald ""just looks like a fabrication,"" Gosse said.Other experts on the period agreed that it was unlikely that Oswald and Cruz had crossed paths.David Abraham, a law professor at the University of Miami, concurred that the pairing sounds unlikely.""I know of no evidence that would have put Cruz in the world of Oswald,"" Abraham said. ""The Fair Play for Cuba Committee types were a mix of ideological supporters of socialist transformation and romantic innocents. Whatever one thinks Oswald was, Cruz was neither of these, so I would doubt that they would have met.""""Any effort to find a more meaningful connection that somehow implicates Cruz Sr. seems outlandish at best,"" Beschloss said.Our rulingTrump said that Rafael Cruz ""was with Lee Harvey Oswald"" before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.The sole ""evidence"" for this claim is a grainy photograph that shows Oswald with a man who may bear a resemblance to Cruz. But experts tell PolitiFact that the image is too degraded to offer much confidence. At the same time, multiple experts about the world of early 1960s pro-Castro advocacy said they have never seen evidence of Cruz associating with Oswald and consider Trump’s claim implausible at best and ridiculous at worst.We rate the claim Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c3361f8f-0108-4c22-874e-6ca77257190b"

In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points.And there’s an even more important problem for Trump’s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn’t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women.Polling a Clinton vs. Trump matchupPollClinton share of female voteTrump share of female voteLead among womenIBD/TIPP5136Clinton +15Rasmussen4135Clinton +6USA Today/Suffolk5534Clinton +21GWU/Battleground5435Clinton +19NBC News/WSJ5633Clinton +23Fox News5533Clinton +22CBS News5831Clinton +27Average5334Clinton +19Clearly, this doesn’t support Trump’s assertion that Clinton ""doesn’t do very well with women.""YearDemocratic candidate’s share of female voteRepublican candidate’s share of female voteIndependent candidate’s share of female voteMajor party faring better among women2012Obama 55Romney 44Dem +112008Obama 56McCain 43Dem +132004Kerry 51Bush 48Dem +32000Gore 54Bush 43Nader 2Dem +111996Clinton 54Dole 38Perot 7Dem +161992Clinton 45Bush 37Perot 17Dem +81988Dukakis 49Bush 50GOP +11984Mondale 44Reagan 56GOP +121980Carter 45Reagan 46Anderson 7GOP +1So, Clinton’s 19-point average lead over Trump among women -- if it held all the way to November -- would give her the biggest winning margin among women of any presidential candidate since at least 1980.The flip side is that Clinton does under-perform among men; the GWU/Battleground poll found that views of Clinton among men are 33 percent favorable, 66 percent unfavorable.

PANTS-FIRE,NH Democrat says popular political stop is infested with rats,"In a case of Democrat backbiting, congressional candidate Shawn O’Connor says a popular New Hampshire restaurant, known for its chicken tenders and visits from presidential candidates, is full of rodents.It’s one of the latest accusations to fly in the Democratic race for the New Hampshire’s first congressional district. O’Connor is running in the primary against Carol Shea Porter, who has previously held the seat.  Of late, both the state Democratic party and O’Connor have accused the other of making false claims.O’Connor put out a statement claiming a Democratic state senator told others that he -- O’Connor -- planned to place rats into the kitchen of the Puritan Backroom restaurant in Manchester. O’Connor denies the allegation.Is there any truth to this claim?O’Connor’s spokesman Logan Barbosa pointed us to the Manchester Department of Health website, which posts city restaurant inspections. Barbosa said the Puritan Backroom has been cited for ""critical item violation #35 (defined as found to have insects or rodents, or areas were identified that would allow the entry of rodents or insects).""There’s a big difference between having rodents, and having areas that would allow their entry. Let’s take a look.In nine of the 18 inspections since 2006, including the four most recent, the restaurant has had ""no critical violations observed,"" records show.The restaurant was most recently cited in 2013, but for food temperature issues. Over the last decade, records show the Puritan Backroom has never been cited for evidence of rodents on the premises or for any infestation.The restaurant was cited in 2011 and 2007 for an ""outer openings"" violation, which falls under the critical item violation #35. In 2011, inspectors noted the ""facilities outer openings have not been tightly sealed to the outside to prevent the entry of pests.""In 2007, inspectors recommended the restaurant install new weather stripping on the rear door, according to Phil Alexakos, Manchester’s Chief of Environmental Health, who oversees inspections.Neither situation meant the restaurant had pests, Alexakos said. ""If these gaps aren’t repaired, it could introduce pests,"" he said.The city’s public health department hasn’t received any complaints about rodents at the facility, according to Alexakos. Officials have never noted the presence of rodents on site, inspection records show.Restaurant president Arthur Pappas -- who co-owns the Puritan Backroom with son Democratic Executive Councilor Chris Pappas -- disputes the claim.  ""It is absolutely untrue,"" Arthur Pappas said. ""Anybody who has been in my kitchen knows there has never been a problem.""Our ruling O’Connor said the Puritan Backroom restaurant has a ""long-standing problem with rodent infestations.""  Inspection records from the last decade show officials have never noted rodents inside the restaurant. While more than five years ago inspectors noted gaps where pests could potentially enter the restaurant, none have been documented inside over the last ten years.

""We have not added any urinals to any women's restrooms nor do we have any plans to do so.""She said the company never had past plans to do so.So what’s going on with the photo?It’s hard to say for certain.We reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, but we haven’t heard back.If Target had made this change, we’d expect more than just one photo to surface.We reached out to the woman on Facebook, and we'll add her response should we hear back.Our rulingA popular Facebook post alleged last week that Target installed urinals in a women’s restroom in California.Target representatives told us the claim is ""inaccurate,"" and that the company has no plans to change its restrooms, and never did. Best we can tell, the Facebook post is a one-off picture that hasn’t surfaced in any other form (other than the thousands of people sharing it).So stop that!

PANTS-FIRE,"Pants on Fire: Jerry Jones says 'absurd' to firmly link football, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy","The owner of America’s Team says science hasn’t cemented a link between playing football and chronic traumatic brain injury.REPORTER: ""No data, in your mind, to have a relationship between CTE and playing football?""JONES: ""No, that's absurd. There's no data that in any way creates knowledge. There's no way that you can have made a comment that there's an association or some type of assertion.""Contrasting NFL commentsWe asked Dalrymple how Jones reached that  conclusion. Dalrymple said Jones hadn’t said then and Dalrymple didn’t think there would be follow-up.But the next month, at a March 14, 2016, roundtable discussion held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Jan. Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president for health and safety, if the link between football and neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE has been establishedBoston University leads researchSo, has science established a link between football and CTE?According to the book, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine, home to neuropathologist Ann McKee, had quickly grown to be recognized as the nation’s leading authority of football-related brain effects--including CTE.""This trauma triggers progressive degeneration of the brain tissue, including the build-up of an abnormal protein called tau,"" the center says. ""These changes in the brain can begin months, years, or even decades after the last brain trauma or end of active athletic involvement. The brain degeneration is associated with memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia.""McKee said at a press conference before the Super Bowl in 2009 (seven-plus years ago): ""I have never seen this disease in the general population, only in these athletes. It’s a crisis, and anyone who doesn’t recognize the severity of the problem is in tremendous denial.""National research perspectiveAll that said, ESPN reported, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, cautioned that much remains unknown about CTE such as how common it is, when and why symptoms develop, and how the disease -- associated with depression, dementia and memory loss -- spreads inside the brain.The story summed up: ""Although many questions remain unanswered, the research appears not only to reinforce the connection between repetitive head trauma and CTE, but also suggests that the disease may be prevalent among people in the general population who played contact sports, not just former NFL players.""Finally, the story noted an independent analysis of brain tissue from people who had played contact sports and those who had not. Researchers including Kevin Bieniek, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Mayo Clinic's Department of Neuroscience, reviewed 66 brains of people who had played contact sports -- primarily high school and college football, but also boxing, rugby, wrestling and soccer. They also examined the brains of 198 control subjects who hadn’t been exposed to contact sports.And in the end, they spotted CTE signs in the brains of 21 people who played contact sports -- at a rate of almost one in three -- but no such signs in the brains of the people who had not played contact sports.Other scientistsThrough Kristin Mears, spokeswoman for the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Lyketsos emailed this statement: ""In my view, there is good evidence to support ‘a link’ between playing football and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries such as developing CTE. The science, however, is still very limited in terms of the strength of the link and many other important aspects of this link. The research that would be necessary to clarify these issues is costly and will take a long time to complete.""""The problem is not whether there is a risk,"" Koliatsos said, ""but how much of a risk there is. The answer is we really don’t know."" He said it would help to have a study following people over time bolstered by PET scans to look for tau buildups in the brains of  living people. ""What we have now is backward data, brains from people who did poorly. We don’t know about people who have done fairly well. That is the scientific issue,"" Koliatsos said.Our rulingJones said it’s ""absurd"" to say there’s enough data to establish a link between playing football and CTE.In fact, scientists have reached consensus establishing this link, though research remains to be done on the degree to which football players and others involved in high-contact activities risk CTE.We find Jones’s ""absurd"" claim absurd.

PANTS-FIRE,Ellen Troxclair lacks facts for claim about chances of sex assault by an Austin taxi driver,"An Austin City Council member made a honk-the-horn statement about passenger assaults as she advocated for voter approval of a proposition that would shrink what the city requires in background checks of drivers who work with ride-hailing services.""Let me say that again,"" Troxclair said. ""When you look at the number of taxi drivers and the number of TNC drivers and the number of complaints that APD,"" the Austin Police Department, ""has received over that time, you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver.""Is this so?Austin Police Department dataSearle told us Troxclair’s office fielded the APD document in a Jan. 27, 2016, email from Brian Manley, APD’s chief of staff, who wrote: ""Please find attached the information you requested on sexual assault allegations against cab drivers and TNC drivers.""Manley’s email also included a cautionary note about making safety comparisons based on the raw counts--a note he re-sounded when we asked him about the council member’s ""nine times"" analysis. His email to Troxclair’s office said: ""Keep in mind these are only allegations of a crime, not cases that have been prosecuted,"" he said. ""Also, it is hard to say whether there are more allegations against cab drivers than TNC drivers because we don't know how many rides each provider gave in a given year so we cannot come up with a rate, only the raw number.""The document lists 37 reported incidents from Feb. 26, 2014, through Jan. 21, 2016, breaking out to 14 complaints about cabs, 21 complaints tied to vehicles driven for Uber or Lyft and two complaints related to ""independent"" ride-hailed vehicles. Each date-and-time entry indicates a crime ranging from assault ""sexual nature"" to sexual assault to rape.If we limit our focus to the 15 months through January 2016 that taxi cabs and ride-hailing services each rolled with city permission, APD's count of cab-connected assault complaints decreases to six. Shrinking the timeframe  leaves unchanged the 23 assault complaints the department lists as related to ride-hailed vehicles.Troxclair’s equationSo, how did Troxclair reach her conclusion about the chances of an Austin assault being nine times higher with a cab driver?Searle wrote: ""If the estimate is that there are 15,000 TNC drivers, subject to name-based background checks, and there are 913 cab permits, subject to fingerprint background check, then you are 9 times more likely to be assaulted by a cab driver than a TNC driver in Austin.""A city spokesman, Bryce Bencivengo, told us by phone the city had issued 915 cab permits at the time Troxclair spoke at the forum though he also said that shouldn’t be read as a count of taxi drivers.Bencivengo said the city also has fielded figures from Uber and Lyft indicating their respective counts of Austin drivers, but each company also says the tallies are proprietary, not to be released to the public. We asked Uber and Lyft for such counts; an Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, said by email it has 15,000 Austin-area drivers, though she later said it’s accurate to say it has over 10,000 drivers in that the count fluctuates.Searle said Troxclair reached her ""nine times"" conclusion by dividing the 14 cab-connected complaints since June 2014 by the 913 cab permits (getting 0.015) and comparing that to what you get from juxtaposing the 23 ride-hail complaints versus 15,000 ride-hail drivers in Austin (or 0.0015) -- which actually suggests a 10-fold difference.Other analystsWe ran Troxclair’s equation and statement past experts on statistics, each of whom flinched.Hersh, who told us he’s donated services to an anti-proposition group, brought up the timeline weakness in considering several months when taxi cabs were legally operating but ride-hailing services were not. He further said it’s not logical to assume driver counts deliver sufficient information to reach relative safety conclusions.Separately, Rachelle Wilkinson, an adjunct professor of statistics at Austin Community College, said the calculations offered by Troxclair aren’t valid ways to gauge the relative incidences of sexual assaults. It’s ""comparing apples to oranges (number of sexual assault reports to number of drivers),"" Wilkinson said by email. ""A much more valid way to look at the data would be to compare the sexual assault reports to the number of rides given---NOT the number of drivers.  Taxi drivers tend to drive as their profession or job whereas ride-hailing drivers often do it on the side.""That is, the number of rides ""given by taxi drivers is likely much higher (per driver) than the number of rides given by ride-hailing drivers (per driver),"" Wilkinson wrote, adding that ride counts didn’t appear to be part of Troxclair’s backup. Also, Wilkinson suggested, the probability of such assaults appears to be extremely small whether riding in a taxi or a ride-hailed car, she wrote.But absent trip data, the experts concurred, there isn’t a fact-backed justification for Troxclair’s statement.Comparisons possible?So, is there a way to compare the chances of assault in the different kinds of rides?Still, Altamirano said, passenger estimates don’t speak to the types or lengths of trips in taxi cabs versus ride-hailed vehicles. ""The more relevant measure for risk assessment is the share of trips or or time spent in vehicle that lead to an incident. We also have to account for potential differences in the underlying populations,"" Altamirano said. ""If almost everybody that takes a taxi is a businessperson going from or to the airport, there might be fewer drunk men and women relative to"" passengers in ride-hailed vehicles. ""If so, assessing the true risk of each service gets more complicated,"" he said. ""And given that there are millions of trips for both services and a relatively small number of reported incidents, it's very hard to feel confident that there are any clear patterns.""We reached out to Uber and Lyft about Troxclair’s statement, also asking for data on trip counts and lengths. By email, Uber’s Moore said Uber trip counts are ""not public."" A Lyft contact didn’t respond.We also heard back from Troxclair, who stressed by phone that she was clear at the forum that she was qualifying her conclusion by saying it was based on the driver counts for taxi cabs and ride-hailing services. She agreed it would be helpful to have detailed trip-count information.Our rulingTroxclair said statistics show ""you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver"" in Austin than a driver for a ride-hailing service.This claim shakes out to dividing oranges into apples and getting grapefruits--a ridiculous notion. Vital data, at the least about the number and length of trips by taxi cabs or ride-hailed vehicles, remains to be seen, making it impossible to definitively say which type of driver or ride more likely risks an assault. It's also worth mention that the chances of assault in either seem very low.This leaves the ""nine times"" statement incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Pants on Fire: Claim there were over 600 reports of Trump votes getting counted for Marco Rubio,"According to a super PAC supporting New Yorker Donald Trump for president, Texas Republicans just experienced a wagon’s worth of election fraud, all oddly to the good for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (who later dropped out of the race).The web post aired concerns about fraud in seven states including Texas after stating the Trump Ballot Security Project was formed ""when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the"" March 2016 ""Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case,"" the post says, ""votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio.""""The form of evidence of voter irregularities the"" party’s ""credentials committee finds compelling is up to the committee and no requirement that a complaint with the state election board or report to party officials is required to make a claim,"" Stone wrote, adding that the affidavits would be submitted to the committee if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel ""elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected"" through ""a pattern of voter fraud.""Stone said the pro-Trump super PAC has ""collected over 2,200 individual SWORN affidavits documenting voter irregularities in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona. 738 of these are in Texas in at least eight counties. We are NOT finished collecting affidavits in Utah and Wisconsin,"" Stone said.""Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign,"" Stone said.Next, to our inquiries, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas and the chairman of the Travis County Republican Party each said he hadn’t heard or seen any reports of Trump votes being recorded for Rubio--or Cruz.Mike Joyce, the state party spokesman, said by phone said he hadn’t seen even one such news story. ""I would have heard about it,"" if so, Joyce said. ""It would have been brought to our attention."" Joyce said that when he heard about the calls to KLBJ-AM suggesting ballot problems, he checked with James Dickey, chairman of the Travis County GOP, who reported back that he’d heard no such reports from polling places.Dickey said by phone he heard ""limited reports"" about Trump votes showing up for Rubio, but nothing was confirmed.To our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, the state’s chief elections officer, said she couldn’t comment on formal complaints pending review and investigation. That said, Alicia Phillips Pierce said, the agency didn’t receive 600 written complaints in connection with the 2016 primaries.Pierce said the agency fielded less than a dozen ""calls from individuals concerned that votes may have been changed from Trump to Rubio,"" but no one ""indicated they had experienced the supposed phenomena themselves or had any direct knowledge of what allegedly occurred. Instead, they were only responding to second-hand reports they heard on the radio or saw online,"" she said.Stone dismissed the lack of confirmation from Texas news reports, writing: ""Old media. Proves nothing."" He also put no stock in the responses we’d drawn from Pierce and on behalf of the state and Travis County Republicans. ""Why would they admit it?"" Stone wrote.Our rulingA pro-Trump super PAC said there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Trump virtually all getting tallied for Rubio.If so, those reports are no longer public, which leaves us to speculate about the content of the unreleased affidavits described by Trump backer Stone.Judging this statement on available facts, there’s no there there--not even a whisper of one.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE," Rhode Island is small, but not that small","After Rhode Island’s proposed ""Cooler & Warmer"" slogan tanked, many small-state natives threw their own catchphrases into the mix.Enter artist Hilary Treadwell, who sells a quirky T-shirt on her website, Lilhop.com. ""Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide.""Naturally, we asked Treadwell how she came up with this number. That’s what fact checkers do.She said she made it up.""I just like the number three, it’s big enough, but small enough,"" she said.""It’s a joke that speaks to a truth.""She did look up the state’s area, and the length of its coastline and fiddled around with the numbers, but couldn’t get much farther.""I would love to know what it really is,"" she said. ""I’m a math nerd, but non-scientific math.""  So we dug in.We quickly discovered this is a tough question, and after tinkering with the Rhode Island Geographic Information System Geospatial Data Catalog for a few hours, we called for backup.  Chuck Labash and Michael Bradley, who work at the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center, say an accurate calculation would require a Ph.d. or master’s-level study into shallow water bathymetry (the science of underwater depth)  and an analysis of Rhode Island’s tides.Or, you could commission a light detection and ranging airplane flight and measure all of the state’s shores using lasers and sensors within the span of the average hour-long low tide period.But this would cost ""hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" according to Bradley. We didn’t think our bosses would bankroll that kind of research.  We turned to Bryan Oakley, a geoscientist who studies glacial, coastal, and marine depositional environments at Eastern Connecticut State University. He was able to give us rough some numbers.""This seems a tad unrealistic to me,"" Oakley said.Here’s Oakley’s cocktail-napkin analysis: Rhode Island has 400 miles of coastline. The intertidal zone, or the area on the shore covered at high tide and uncovered at low tide, is at most 50 feet wide. The fluctuation in size between tides is about 3.7 square miles at most, making the state .37 percent bigger at low tide, he said.  These numbers, he told us, are very rough and his guess is that Rhode Island is about .1 percent bigger at low tide.Labash and Bradley agreed. So did Jim Turenne, a soil scientist for the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service.Our Ruling: On T-shirts and postcards, Treadwell writes: ""Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide.""She admits making that up.""It’s like I know we’re weird and have problems but hey, we’re still here,"" Treadwell said.  Besides, who would buy a T-shirt saying: ""Rhode Island: 0.1% bigger at low tide?""Nevertheless, it’s ruling time and this is certainly a ridiculous (although fanciful) claim."
PANTS-FIRE,Website stirs Zika fears with false claim about 'liquefied brains',"The claim is completely wrong, and has the barest connection to any actual research. Seeing as it showed up in quick succession in Australia and the United Kingdom, we thought we should move quickly to squash it.The Weekly Observer piece has the gloss of authentic reporting.In a (sic) recent research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers tracked the development of a foetus whose mother contracted the virus on a trip to Central America, when she was 3 months pregnant.The blood tests and the magnetic resonance images showed that the virus was slowly turning the baby’s brain into liquid over a course of nine weeks. At 21 weeks the woman aborted the foetus.That changed by the 19th week. Basic structures in the cranium were not as they should be. That combined with proof that the mother was infected with the Zika virus and a more detailed view using MRI led the parents to terminate the pregnancy at 21 weeks.An autopsy found Zika virus in the fetal brain tissue. Areas of the brain had dead cells and some that had begun to break down.But did the researchers say that the brain had been liquefied?""This is absolutely NOT what we said,"" wrote Adre du Plessis, one of the lead authors and director of the Fetal Medicine Institute at the Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C.A second author, Rita Drigger, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, called the description a ""false interpretation"" of  the case.A third author, Olli Vapalahti at the Department of Virology at the University of Helsinki, Finland, told us some reporter might have misunderstood him during an interview.""I may have tried to explain -- perhaps in too simple terms -- that there was thinning of the cortex and enlargement of the ventricles in the brain, meaning that some of the brain tissue had been replaced by cerebrospinal fluid,"" Vapalahti said. ""I can now see that this has emerged to some hype message which certainly I have not intended to deliver.""In other words, it wasn’t that brain tissue was turned to liquid. Rather, space where brain cells would normally be found contained fluid instead.In a conference call with reporters on March 30, du Plessis said the main point of the article was to caution doctors and parents that an extremely small head might not be the sole indicator of brain damage associated with the Zika virus. In this case, the brain was small but the head was still within the normal range.""What this says is that the current criteria may be falsely reassuring,"" du Plessis said.Further, while the presence of the Zika virus in fetal brain tissue strongly indicated that the virus caused the harm, the researchers stopped short of saying this case proved a causal connection.We reached out to the Weekly Observer and so far have not heard back.Our rulingWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.""In no way was it meant to 'stir fears' or promote any false claims,"" Malham said. ""We assure you the article was deleted as soon as we received your email. I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of the entire editorial team.""It then explains its original error.""Earlier this week, The Weekly Observer aggregated an article from various sources online, saying that Zika Virus is responsible for turning Fetus brain into liquid.""The original article on Uproxx.com  ‘New Data Shows That The Zika Virus Can Turn Fetal Brain Into Liquid’, as well as several others, turned out to contain false claims as the study was misinterpreted by various sources."""

""If they weren’t funded, they’d have to stop patrolling.""What Trump could have meant -- though it’s not what he said -- is that undocumented immigrants in the United States may be benefitting from subsidies such as food stamps through their children.

Rather, it’s Fields who is being deceptive, he said.We tried to reach Trump and Fields and did not hear back.At the CNN town hall, Trump said Fields’ initial claim was that she fell to the ground or that she almost fell to the ground. It was the latter.""As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, (Fields) pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question,"" Terris wrote.

PANTS-FIRE,Image in a Chris Abele ad shows lake that's supposedly created by Estabrook Dam,"That image forms the backdrop for a statement printed on the screen about his opponent’s support of repairs to the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River: ""Chris Larson: $5 million of taxpayer money to benefit a few wealthy citizens.""The narrator takes the claim further, saying the repairs give the wealthy residents ""their own lake.""The message conveyed by the image is clear: These are the properties of those wealthy residents living along the lake created by the Estabrook Dam.Only they’re not.A deeper diveBefore we, um, dive into this one, here is some background on the long-running debate over whether to repair the dam.Built in the 1930s, the dam -- which sits on the river just north of Milwaukee, at the border of Shorewood and Glendale -- was installed to help control flooding and to maintain swimming and water recreation in an urban setting, especially in and around Lincoln Park.It has also created generations of what amounts to lakefront living for some people. When the dam gates are closed, the river forms a 100-acre impoundment upstream. There are about 165 property owners in the area whose property abuts the water, according to a 2015 report prepared for the county.Today, the dam is in poor condition,. The state Department of Natural Resources has ordered the county to keep the gates open until the structure is either repaired or abandoned. That means the lake has been, in effect, drained, and it’s a plain-old river again.Abele and the County Board have disagreed about how to proceed. Larson himself was a member of the board before he was elected state Senator.Abele sides with the Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups that wants the dam removed so the river can be kept in its natural state.Years ago, the North Avenue Dam, several miles downstream, was removed and experts have said the faster current has led to improved water quality, a thriving fish population and new wildlife habitat.A majority of the County Board disagrees and wants to spend about $3.4 million on repairs and $2.2 million in operating and maintenance costs over the next 20 years.Image is all wetThat leads us to the image used in the ad. It looks more like Door County than the Milwaukee River. And that’s not the kind of boat or property you’d find in that area.The boat pictured is either a fishing boat or cruiser and could be up to 36-feet long, said Charles Plueddeman, an Oshkosh-based freelance writer who focuses on the marine industry.""A boat this size could be used on large lakes or offshore in salt water,"" he said.""When I looked at the photo my first thought was ‘this does not look like Wisconsin,’"" Plueddeman said. ""I've not been to that site, but I don't think it would be surrounded by the high, rocky bluffs in this photo. And that would be a very big boat to use on that little impoundment.""Indeed, pontoons and jet skis are more commonly found in the area, said Clark Blachly, who owns a nearby home.""I have been up and down this river hundreds of times there is nothing remotely like this,"" he said.We asked Abele’s campaign manager Tia Torhorst about the image in the ad. She said it was ""stock footage"" and was unaware of where it was shot.In short, it’s not the Milwaukee River.We’ve seen previous -- admittedly higher profile -- instances of the wrong images being used to make point in a political ad.Our ratingAn Abele TV ad uses a lakefront image to criticize Chris Larson for supporting $5 million in Estabrook Dam repairs to benefit ""a few wealthy citizens."" But the photo used is not the Milwaukee River and the boat pictured would be woefully out of place there.We rate the claim that the image represents the area Pants on Fire."

Marco Rubio won his birthplace of Miami-Dade before dropping out of the race), but Trump’s nearly unanimous win is hardly unprecedented.Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state in the 2012 Republican primary, and both the GOP and Democrats split their primaries three ways in 2008.But in 2004, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats.That feat was repeated by both parties in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore won all 67 for the Democrats and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won all 67 for Republicans.In 1996, Bob Dole took 66 of 67 counties for the GOP primary — but really, the 67th was a tie at 190 votes each for Dole and Pat Buchanan in Washington County.Bill Clinton took 63 counties in 1992’s Democratic primary. Paul Tsongas won Alachua, Martin, Seminole and Palm Beach counties. Pat Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to incumbent president George H.W. Bush that year and won Hardee County. Bush nabbed the other 66.In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 64 counties, losing three to Pat Robertson in the GOP race. Counties were split over their Democratic candidate, but Michael Dukakis won the state. Walter Mondale and Gary Hart divided the state for Democrats in 1984, with Jesse Jackson winning one county and John Glenn two.  The state’s online data only goes back to 1978, but there were enough examples to prove Trump wrong in this case.In 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100 percent of Florida counties for the Democrats.

PANTS-FIRE,Light a match to Greg Abbott's ridiculous claim about 'rampant voter fraud',"Greg Abbott took exception to President Barack Obama’s pokes about voter turnout and the governor followed up with a claim that, if supported, would arguably justify Texas Rangers manning polling stations.Obama otherwise called it important for conference participants to study ways of redesigning ""our systems"" to step up voter turnout. Then the Democratic leader said, to laughter, ""the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate.""Abbott, a Republican, told reporters three days later: ""To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment.""We’re separately checking his turnout tout.Abbott, the former longtime state attorney general, went on: ""The fact is voter fraud is rampant--and in Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud.""Rampant fraud?

""There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots.  There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls,"" Levitt said. ""There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls.""Separately, Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014.Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes cast suggests the incidence of Texas voter fraud was about 1 in 18 million.Plaintiff’s lawyer: ‘Not rampant’By phone, Clark told us that ""under no definition of rampant is voter fraud rampant in Texas and the United States,"" though, she said, ""that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.""Our rulingAbbott, defending the Texas mandate to present a photo ID at the polls, said: ""Voter fraud is rampant.""If Abbott has the goods on this, he’s keeping secrets. Best we can tell, in-person voter fraud--the kind targeted by the ID law--remains extremely rare, which makes this claim incorrect and ridiculous.Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,"Donald Trump cites dubious legend about Gen. Pershing, pig's blood and Muslims","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph ""Black Jack"" Pershing.During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War.After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies.After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a ""legend.""We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump’s takeaway is wrong-headed. We’ll take a look at those two concerns separately below.Did it happen?The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades.But the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines.Other historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least.Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to ""pacifying"" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors.""He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.""Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions.""The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,"" Janda said. ""This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.""Facts aside, Trump’s larger point is wrongTo many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified ""terrorists"" is actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable.Silbey of Cornell agreed. ""Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,"" he said. ""The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism.""If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative.""The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,"" Janda said. ""It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.""Our rulingOf the eight historians we checked with, all were at least skeptical that what Trump said actually happened, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. The only evidence of something approximating what Trump said stems from one letter documenting a different scenario written by a veteran more than a half century after the fact.Perhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. In all, Trump’s claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire.In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics.""While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, they do not support the claim Trump made. There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig’s blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today.When we ran this additional information by three of the historians we checked with for our original story -- Silbey, Linn and Janda -- they told us they agreed with our conclusion. Our rating remains Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, arthritic goat milk cannot cure HIV","An Australian doctor says he cured Charlie Sheen and the island nation of Comoros of HIV with a curious treatment — specifically, arthritic goat’s milk.Oz pointed out that Chachoua was not licensed to practice medicine in the United States and his method of convincing Sheen — by injecting himself with Sheen’s blood — was not only unorthodox, but highly inappropriate. Sheen agreed to take his medicine again.It gets weirder.This treatment, says Chachoua, not only cured Sheen but helped eradicate HIV in Comoros, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, in 2006.""We have no cure for AIDS and it’s certainly not going to be anything related to goat’s milk,"" said Jeffrey Laurence, the senior scientific consultant for programs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.The facts on CAEVWhat does this mean? If you remember the lock-and-key model from your biology textbook, you’ll know that your body produces antibodies that are specific to an antigen. Some CAEV antibodies, in addition to flagging CAEV, can also identify HIV. Simply put, they recognize HIV as an antigen. That’s it.  There is no evidence these antibodies ""destroy"" or protect against HIV, said Brian Murphy, a professor of pathology at the University of California Davis’ School of Veterinary Medicine, who’s studied CAEV.Scientists have actually known about this cross-reactivity for decades, but in the grand scheme of AIDS research, it’s meaningless, according to Laurence of amfAR.""It wouldn’t make my list of 100 things to consider in the search for a cure,"" he said. ""There are so many more interesting things to look into without having to look into cross-reactions with goats.""Yahia Chebloune, one of the immunologists on the team, explained the concept to us.The team’s vaccine prototype combines CAEV with HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). Unlike HIV, CAEV doesn’t destroy T helper cells — the white blood cells essential to the immune system — nor does it replicate as aggressively and indefinitely or create an AIDS-like disease in goats.Got goat milk""This is the craziest story I’ve ever heard,"" said Chebloune. ""The claims of Dr. Sam Chachoua are not scientifically serious.""Is it possible that Chachoua inoculated Sheen with a homemade CAEV-based vaccine like Chebloune’s? Our multiple requests for comment went unanswered so we’ll never know for sure.But the one CAEV vaccine prototype we found triggered an immune response in animals and has yet to be tested on humans. What’s more, as Lawrence of amfAR noted, vaccinating someone against a disease is not the same thing as curing it.Our rulingChachoua said he cured Charlie Sheen and Comoros of HIV with ""milk from goats which had arthritis.""Chachoua is taking a nugget of science and twisting into an absurd claim. There is no proof that CAEV — a relative of HIV that’s studied for its vaccine potential — neutralizes HIV.Sheen and people on the island of Comoros both have HIV.We rate Chachoua’s claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Jonathan Stickland makes Pants on Fire claim about Scott Fisher forcing Texans into Obamacare,"That’s war talk for Republicans. And is it so?The narrator of the ad, which was brought to our attention by Fisher consultant Craig Murphy, says Fisher, a Bedford church pastor, is running a negative campaign backed by liberals. Also, the narrator says, Fisher ""tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare.""The image presented with that claim:Stickland consultant cites board resolutionWe asked Stickland’s campaign consultant, Luke Macias, how Stickland concluded that Fisher voted to push a million Texans into Obamacare.By email and phone, Macias maintained that documents emailed to us by Murphy demonstrate that as a member of a board, Fisher in 2013 propelled approval of a ""pro-Obamacare"" resolution that mentioned the Texas effect of Medicaid expansion and urged lawmakers to consider all options to cover health care for indigent Texans which, Macias suggested, would have included Medicaid expansion. Macias said the resolution’s Medicaid element added up to Fisher trying to force Texans into Obamacare.Board action in 2013The relevant documents concern the board of managers for the Tarrant County Hospital District, the county’s tax-supported health district. Fisher was a board member from May 2005 into January 2015, district spokeswoman J.R. Labbe told us by email.Labbe put us in touch with the board chairman at the time, Fisher supporter Trent Petty, who said by phone he didn’t advocate the original resolution once it was offered for the agenda by district staff. Moreover, he said, ""our board never voted for the resolution to expand Medicaid."" Petty suggested we ask Robert Earley, the district’s president and CEO, how the resolution landed on the agenda. By phone, Earley said he couldn’t immediately recall; he speculated an association circulated the proposal to hospitals and other health care entities.Petty told us that at the critical 2013 meeting, board members adopted the call to support ""uncompensated care"" instead of the Medicaid expansion resolution after discussion and agreement among members not to support expansion. Petty said: ""Our board was not comfortable with Medicaid expansion. That substituted language was necessary because we didn’t want... to simply be silent about uncompensated care being addressed in some form or fashion by the state.""Labbe confirmed that board meetings weren’t recorded, leaving us no audio or video record to review.Hospital district resolutionsLet’s peek at the resolutions.Fisher’s recapFisher said he entered the meeting believing the board shouldn’t take a pro-expansion position, which would be ""going totally opposite the recent statement of our governor.""We asked Fisher why the adopted resolution opens by saying the Affordable Care Act would add more than a million impoverished adult Texans to Medicaid. He replied: ""Unsustainability. Those were statements that were made that showed the unsustainability, ‘the fool’s errand’ of expanding Medicaid coverage."" Murphy elaborated by email: ""The Whereas  statements"" in the resolution ""were meant, as in every resolution, as a statement of the current situation. The situation was bad.""""We stripped out any call for Medicaid expansion,"" Fisher summed up.Macias, asked to elaborate on Stickland's claim, said by email: ""Fact: The resolution discusses the benefits of Obamacare and Medicaid expansion and then asks the Legislature to keep ‘ALL possible options.’ How is Medicaid expansion not included in ‘all possible options?’""Our rulingStickland says Fisher ""tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare.""At best, this claim misinterprets Fisher’s motion for the hospital district board to approve a resolution asking lawmakers to fund indigent health care. The adopted proposal urges consideration of all possible sustainable options. However, it doesn't call for forcing Texans into Obamacare.We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump repeats Pants on Fire claim that unemployment rate could be 42 percent,"During his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump repeated a claim he’d made several times before.""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,"" Trump said. ""The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.""Actually, Trump’s the one who shouldn’t be believed. Numbers that high are not even close to accurate.To understand why, let’s start by discussing how the official unemployment rate is calculated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.During the most recent month -- January 2016 -- the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008.Not factored into this calculation, however, are people who are not currently looking for work. This is a longstanding concern for economists, because at least some of those people who aren’t looking for work right now might prefer to be looking for work but don’t feel they have a shot in the current job market.To ease such concerns, the bureau also produces a statistic with a more expansive definition of what it calls ""labor underutilization."" This statistic is known by the wonky shorthand ""U-6.""The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially ""unemployed"" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.Currently the U-6 rate is 9.9 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. But that’s also its lowest level since May 2008.It’s possible to argue that the U-6 rate offers a fairer way of encapsulating the unemployment picture; some mainstream economists are sympathetic to that argument.But where Trump goes off the rails is in suggesting that the ""real"" unemployment rate is somewhere between 28 percent and 42 percent.Why? He’s including a ton of Americans not expected to be working. Let’s explore this point further.Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a ""plausible measure of the potential workforce."" If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you run the numbers, ""the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent,"" Stockman wrote.Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.Indeed, in his column, Stockman acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.""Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers,"" he wrote. ""We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else.""Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.Stockman’s calculation ""treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all.""In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.So is there a plausible calculation that can get us to 42 percent? The short answer is no.To see why, let’s start with the number of Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. That gives us 94 million ""non-working"" Americans.We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work.So what remains? By this calculation, there are 10.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working.If you were to use these numbers to create a new type of ""unemployment"" rate -- call it ""U-7"" if you like -- it would come out to 15.6 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 percent, but it’s only a fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.This isn’t a perfect calculation. There’s probably some double-counting, and there could be good reasons why some of those 10.5 million Americans aren’t working, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, undergoing job training, or being affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early. Some might argue that students shouldn’t get off so easy because they should be able to handle a job along with their studies, or that we should set a higher retirement-age cutoff than 65.Quibble with the numbers if you like, but this is a solid enough back-of-the envelope calculation to show how wildly inaccurate Trump’s claim is. And remember, we are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent.There’s even a silver lining to the current state of affairs, Burtless said. Most of those suffering from being ""out of work"" by Trump's definition can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.The fact that millions of adults are what Trump would term ""jobless,"" he said, ""is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits.""Our rulingTrump said, ""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.""While economists say that there are other, more expansive calculations of unemployment or under-employment, none of the official ones are currently higher than 9.9 percent, and the highest credible number we could calculate was 15.6 percent. That’s far, far lower than 42 percent -- or even 28 percent. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Blogger mangles info on African electrification aid project,"""Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed miserably,"" went the headline in Greenfield’s piece, which was originally published July 31, 2015, but has continued to make the rounds.We’ll get to problems of the grid and reliability in a bit, but the larger issue, and the focus of this fact-check, is whether the Obama administration has actually spent $7 billion to boost electric capacity in Africa.We reached out to Greenfield and did not hear back.The Power Africa initiativeTo make that happen, the administration said it would commit more than $7 billion over five years. The lion’s share of the total -- $5 billion -- would come from the Export-Import Bank, which offers both direct loans and insurance to back-up the deals American companies make with overseas buyers. Another government body, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, would provide about $1.5 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees to do much the same thing.For example, if General Electric built power plants in Ghana, Ghana would be required to pay for the project, and U.S. insurance would make sure General Electric got its money should Ghana fall short.The Power Africa initiative is the starting point for statements about Obama spending $7 billion on electric projects in Africa. The key flaw in Greenfield’s assertion is the program has been slow to get off the ground. When Greenfield wrote his piece, only about a quarter of the total funds had been committed.The status of Power AfricaAccording to the U.S. Agency for International Development, as of August 2015, about $1.7 billion in aid had been obligated. That includes over $1 billion in project financing aid from the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and about $600 million in technical assistance from USAID.Whether all of that $1.7 billion (or $2.1 billion if you include a new project announced in October) represents actual spending lies somewhat in the eye of the beholder. The Export-Import Bank generates a return on its loans and its default rate is low. In 2014, it delivered over $670 million in profits to the U.S. Treasury. Point being, money comes back.But even under the broadest definition of spending, Power Africa has spent much less than half of its earmarked money while it’s now about two and a half years into a five-year effort. Deborah Brautigam directs the International Development Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Brautigam told PolitiFact that a big part of the problem was the congressional battle in 2014 over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.""When Congress didn’t reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, they couldn’t initiate any new projects,"" Brautigam said.Another problem was Power Africa relies on private companies to decide it makes sense to invest in a given African country. Brautigam said the government can’t force firms to move forward.Producing power vs. getting it to peopleThey didn’t criticize Power Africa so much as describe its limitations. Co-author Edward Miguel, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, said Greenfield’s piece distorted the Kenyan research.""It is a bit disappointing, to say the least, when someone runs with your research and writing and grossly misinterprets it,"" Miguel said. ""I would prefer for Power Africa to focus on some different areas, but much of the funding appears to be going into investments that are useful.""Rudy Gharib, spokewoman for Power Africa, said many of the early projects focused on boosting generating capacity ""because of the long lead time needed to get those deals online and because most countries are facing capacity shortages and it is not possible to connect large numbers of new customers without addressing the issue of there not being enough power on the grid.""Our rulingGreenfield said that Obama had spent $7 billion and failed to bring electricity to Africa. The projected dollar total was correct, but the statement missed the reality that as of August 2015, only about $1.7 billion had been committed. And a lot of the money that will be committed will be in the form of loans or loan guarantees, not gifts.How can you declare failure on a project that isn't yet completed?We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Abbott claim on federal fishing rules snags on facts,"Abbott’s January 2016 declaration added up to a sweeping denunciation of federal overreach in which he urged Americans to hold a constitutional convention to limit the authority of the Supreme Court and federal oversight of the states.""Over the last two centuries, the federal Congress has steadily expanded its reach into every nook and cranny of every Americans' life — and kicked the states to the curb in the process,"" Abbott said. Among examples, Abbott elaborated: ""While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep.""Anyone who fishes knows about minimum lengths. The rules are aimed at preventing anglers from removing young fish before they’ve had time to reproduce.So, have the feds really pushed the states aside as the arbitrator of minimum fish lengths down to the tenth of an inch?Abbott’s info In an email, Abbott spokesman John Wittman responded to our inquiry by pointing out a federal law providing minimum length limits for certain kinds of fish caught in ocean waters at issue in a federal case brought against Florida fisherman John Yates in 2007.Wittman told us the officer determined that 72 of Yates’ red grouper measured between 18.75 and 19.75 inches — below the 20-inch minimum. Wittman said the officer was ""thus, charging Mr. Yates with violating federal fish standard by literally fractions of an inch.""State lawsThough Abbott's comments about federal fishing regulations were not limited to Texas alone, it seemed appropriate to begin with the Lone Star State.With Abbott’s backup in hand, we called the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to ask if the federal government sets minimum fish lengths for everyone who fishes in Texas.Department spokesman Josh Havens said by phone that, to the contrary, Texas maintains its own regulations on minimum fish lengths for any catches in public waters. Also, he said, no length regulations apply to fish caught in waters wholly on private lands.Havens agreed that federal fishery laws only apply outside of state waters.Next, we shared with Wittman our haul of information contradicting the governor’s claim. Wittman replied by email:  ""The point is that this entire area -- water, fish, fishing, etc. -- used to be an area of STATE regulation. Put differently, there were NO federal laws governing fish size. It’s the change from state to federal law that we are complaining about.""HistorySo, did the feds take control over what what the states once controlled?The web pages noted by Garrett laid out some history:In the 1940s, several states claimed jurisdiction over resources off their coasts, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck that claim down in 1947, saying states had no title to resources off their shores.The two comparedSo, states never actually ceded authority over fishing to federal rules. That is, as state and federal officials told us, the federal rules only pick up where the state’s authority ends, nine miles from the shoreline in the case of Texas.The federal rules do exist. Could they be overbearing and tyrannical anyway?Another distinction: Texas regulates more fish species than the feds. Havens said that’s because more fish are fishable in the shallow coastal region than in the deeper federally-regulated portions of the ocean. Fish speciesTPWD minimum length (inches)NOAA minimum length for Gulf reef region (inches)Amberjack3430Atlantic sharpnose shark24noneBanded rudderfishnone14Bass18noneBlacktip shark24noneBonnethead shark24noneCatfish, channel and blue12noneCatfish, flathead18noneCatfish, gafftopsail14noneCobia3733Drum, black14noneDrum, red20noneFlounder14noneGar, alligatornonenoneGrouper, blacknone24Grouper, gag2222Grouper, goliathcatch and releasenoneGrouper, yellowfinnone20Lesser amberjacknone14Mackerel, king2724Mackerel, Spanish1412Marlin, blue131noneMarlin, white86noneMulletNonenoneOther allowable sharks64noneSailfish84noneScampnone16Seatrout15noneSheepshead15noneSnapper, lane88Snapper, red1516Snapper, vermillion1010Snook24noneTarpon85noneTriggerfish, gray1614Tripletail17noneFinally, no minimum lengths - state or federal - were specified to anything more precise than the nearest whole inch, meaning no tenths-of-an-inch restrictions.Our rulingIn a January declaration promoting a restoration of powers to the states, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott complained, ""While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep.""According to authorities, both the state of Texas and the federal government set minimum lengths for keeping fish caught by anglers. The feds’ authority, however, only begins at nine miles from the coast of Texas, right where the state’s jurisdiction ends.In other words, the federal government has taken no regulatory authority away from the states when it comes to minimum fish lengths.Moreover, since the state of Texas and the federal government both set similar limits specific only to the nearest whole inch, the suggestion the feds’ rules are stricter doesn’t hold water.We rate this claim: Pants on Fire"
PANTS-FIRE,No evidence to support rumors tying Zika to genetically modified mosquitoes,"One of the claims goes something like this: Zika is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes, a testament to what happens when man tampers with nature or a purposefully manufactured weapon for population control.The video explains that British biotechnology company Oxitec engineered genetically modified mosquitoes to fight the spread of dengue fever and other diseases with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec recently released these mosquitoes in Brazil, ""where we have this explosion of Zika,"" the video says. ""Writing’s on the wall, folks.""We wondered if there is any truth to the notion that Zika is being spread by transgenic mosquitoes.In a word, no. Epidemiologists told us the rumor is baseless. The mosquitoes in question wouldn’t have been capable of starting the outbreak in 2015, and the geographic correlation offered doesn’t hold up.A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the organization has seen no evidence suggesting that Zika is linked to genetically modified mosquitoes.""I don’t know of any scientific evidence for this rumor, or any obvious way to do this that would be more efficient than natural transmission,"" said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.  ""I cannot state more emphatically that I believe this theory to be absolutely untrue,"" said Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University.Let’s dissect this claim bit by bit.Not a new diseaseIn the next half century, evidence of Zika was found in human fluids in a number of African and Asian countries, but only 14 cases of the human disease were documented.In May 2015, Brazil reported the first cases of Zika infection along with a surge in infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which baby’s head is abnormally small. There are now an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases in the country and the disease has spread across Latin America.Incapable mosquitoesThe claim’s second problem is that genetically modified bugs couldn’t have been responsible for the 2015 Zika outbreak.Oxitec spokesman Matthew Warren told PolitiFact that the mosquitoes typically self-destruct within one to four days, and the gene disappears from the population about 12 weeks after the initial release.""This means that offspring of the mosquito do not survive,"" said Durbin of Johns Hopkins. ""Therefore, the progeny of these mosquitoes, even if infected with Zika, would not survive to transmit Zika.""Wrong locationThe claim’s third problem is the geographic correlation, which besides not being the same thing as causation doesn’t actually match up.For another, the trials took place months and years before the Camaçari outbreak (between May 2011 and September 2012 in Juazeiro and in Jacobina between June 2013 and December 2014). So ""even if an Oxitec mosquito ‘hitched a lift,’ "" it would have died long before, Warren said.Oxitec’s true role in Zika’s rapid spreadExperts said the current explosion of Zika in Brazil is more likely due to the lack of barriers, higher population density, increased mobility and novelty of the disease rather than mutant mosquitos.Whereas the disease was confined by the ocean and small populations in Yap and French Polynesia, Durbin pointed out, Zika could spread through a huge amount of territory and infect way more humans in Brazil.""I think it’s extremely likely these introductions are inadvertent and not intentional because historically we’ve seen this kind of thing happen many times,"" Morse said.One final note. The viral image focuses part of its criticism on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation helped fund the genetically modified mosquito program. The foundation also is helping support PolitiFact’s efforts to fact-check claims about global health and development. Gates has no input over what we fact-check or the rulings we issue.An Internet rumor propagated in a YouTube video claims that the ""Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic).""There’s no evidence that this is true. The argument offered — where the Zika outbreak occurred matches up with where the transformed mosquitoes were released — doesn’t hold up. What’s more, the mosquitoes in question were specifically engineered to self-destruct before they can spread viruses.This claim is both inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Sanchez makes Pants On Fire claim about California gun database,"Critics have repeatedly attacked California Attorney General Kamala Harris for what they say is her slow progress investigating gun owners who are legally prohibited from having them.In 2001, California created the nation’s only database to identify these gun owners, including the mentally ill and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders. It allows the seizure of weapons by law enforcement from people in the prohibited categories.But a decade after it went into effect, the tracking system has a backlog of thousands of cases.Enter Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The Orange County congresswoman is Harris’ closest competitor for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats.We decided to focus on whether the database exists, and check on how the state funds have been spent. Our researchIt cross-references all handgun and assault weapon owners in California against criminal records. It’s designed to check for individuals who legally purchased or registered a firearm but later committed a crime that would prevent them from owning the gun. Law enforcement agents are charged with tracking down the individuals and trying to confiscate their weapons.The database became active in December 2006, according to Harris’ office, or four years before she was elected attorney general.""Yes. It does exist,"" said Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office. ""These (enforcement) agents are working these cases every day. … It’s definitely a lot of work. It’s time consuming.""""The database absolutely exists,"" added Mike McLively, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.We asked the Sanchez campaign to explain her claim.A campaign spokesman argued that it’s correct — if you add words that greatly change the original statement:""To date, we don’t have that database as it was promised by the (State) Department of Justice in 2013,"" the spokesman wrote in an email.Still a backlog?It’s a clear misstatement to say ""we don’t have that database."" But we wanted to see what progress Harris has made reducing its backlog, to better examine Sanchez’s claim that ""nothing was done"" and that ""$25 million was spent.""A sample of the firearms seized through the state's APPS program.

The office’s authority to spend the remainder expires May 1, though Harris has asked the Legislature to create a permanent funding stream for the program.Our rulingRep. Loretta Sanchez said in a recent interview that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has done ""nothing"" to address a backlog of cases in a high-profile gun ownership tracking system. The database allows law enforcement to seize guns from people with criminal records and mental illness.Not only does the program exist, but some progress has been made. The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That’s after Harris’ office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor.Some continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there’s no denying that the Attorney General’s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns. And that’s far from ""nothing.""While there’s room to criticize the pace of the program, Sanchez’s statement amounts to a complete misrepresentation of reality.We rate the claim Pants On Fire. Senate Bill 140 Supplemental Budget Report"
PANTS-FIRE,Is this truly a picture of 'Milwaukee's Renaissance' under Mayor Tom Barrett?,"In his campaign for mayor of Milwaukee, Ald. Bob Donovan has criticized the record of Mayor Tom Barrett on crime, the incumbent’s support for a downtown streetcar and the conditions of the city’s neighborhoods.On Jan. 29, 2016, about two weeks ahead of the primary election, Donovan posted on his campaign Facebook page an attack that included a photograph of a dilapidated home. The home was pocked by broken or boarded-up windows, torn-off siding and holes in exterior walls.The post had been shared more than 80 times over the next three days.But it didn’t take that long for a Facebook reader to question how true of a picture it was.Several hours after Donovan’s posting, someone identified on Facebook as Gilberto Gonzales Jr. posted a reply, saying:""This structure was used by the Milwaukee Fire Department for a training fire. It is scheduled for demolition. Prior to that fire it did not look like that. This photo by itself is deceiving.""Gonzalez, it turns out, is someone who would know -- a lieutenant in the Milwaukee Fire Department who was the lead instructor of its training division until 2015. Donovan responded on Facebook that evening, saying:""Perhaps that's the case, Gilberto. But if you're familiar with the corner, you know too that there's about five additional boarded-up homes in eyesight, a fact that is not deceiving. By the way, I was not familiar with the history of the building, but quite frankly I have seen similar dilapidated residences in my travel throughout the city.""The Fire Department confirmed to us that the house, at 3068 N. 20th St., was used for training -- including with live fires in October 2015, which explains the large holes in the structure. The department chose it for training after it was put on the city’s demolition list. Eventually it will be demolished.Donovan told us he didn’t realize the house is in such a condition because of the training. But he contended that didn’t detract from his overall point about deteriorating neighborhoods, saying ""I’m certain we’d have no problem locating another home that looks like that"" in Milwaukee’s inner city.But whether other homes look something like that one doesn’t bear on whether Donovan’s Facebook statement is accurate.In the nearly six years of PolitiFact Wisconsin, we’ve rated dozens of claims as Pants on Fire. That includes three made by Barrett during his gubernatorial campaigns against Gov. Scott Walker.But none of the POFs were related to actual flames.Until now.Our ratingDonovan said in a Facebook post: ""This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership."" The post included a picture of a dilapidated home, all right.

PANTS-FIRE,Flat-out wrong: Rapper B.o.B. duels with Neil deGrasse Tyson over whether Earth is round,"It’s a rap battle straight out of the 15th century.On the other side is astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, known more for his truth-telling about the universe and climate change than spitting rhymes.Their beef: B.o.B. says the earth is flat. Yes, really.We won’t attempt to rap; we’d only embarrass ourselves.

No way, said David Trilling, an astronomy professor at Northern Arizona University.

PANTS-FIRE,Ted Cruz's Pants on Fire claim that health care law is nation's 'biggest job-killer',"To a man, the seven candidates on the stage at the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, oppose Obamacare. When Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was asked what he would do for the millions of people who have gained health insurance thanks to the program, Cruz was quick to describe his take on the health care law’s failings.""First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster,"" Cruz said. ""It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.""Now Cruz is claiming that the critics were right, and it all has come to pass.Only that’s not true, either. At least in any way that the national data picks up.The numbers run against Cruz’s statement.April 2010September 2010January 2014December 2015Unemployment rate9.99.56.65Number of jobs (thousands)139,297139,396145,092149,929Unwilling part-timers (thousands)9,1789,2467,2506,022 All of the job numbers have moved in a positive direction since April 2010, the first full month after President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The unemployment rate has moved steadily from 9.9 percent to 5 percent. The economy has added about 10.7 million jobs. And the number of working people who have part-time work but would rather have full-time work has fallen by nearly 3 million. There was a brief rise in that number between April and September 2010, but the longer term trend is clearly one of decline.That’s not to say the Affordable Care Act deserves all the credit. The fact is many factors drive the labor market and the overall recovery from the Great Recession is the dominant player in this regard.Still, economist Gary Burtless at the Brookings Institution said job growth has been steady and nearly all of it has been in full-time positions. The pattern, he said contradicts ""the prediction that the law would push employers to reduce the hours of their employees in order to avoid the law's penalties on employers who do not provide insurance to the full-time employees.""""In the face of this evidence, critics of the Affordable Care Act keep telling us their predictions of the ‘job killing’ impacts of Obamacare have been borne out by experience,"" Burtless said. ""So far as I can see, this is flatly untrue.""Pinkovskiy found that in terms of jobs, Texas grew at a faster clip than Minnesota.""More exposed states and counties have, if anything, experienced a rise in employment, salaries and output relative to less exposed areas with the implementation or the enactment of the ACA,"" Pinkovskiy wrote.""But that’s far from the millions some have claimed, and it’s not clear that the ACA is responsible,"" Garrett said.We reached out to the Cruz campaign and did not hear back.Our rulingCruz said that Obamacare cost the country millions of jobs and had forced millions into working part-time.The government’s employment surveys show no sign of that occurring. By every measure, millions more people are working and millions fewer are stuck unwillingly in part-time work since the time the Affordable Care Act became law. The law might have affected part-time work for certain kinds of people, but that didn’t change the improvement in the overall numbers.Many of these numbers, especially the well-reported unemployment rate, are readily available and independent economic studies uncovered no sign that job growth has suffered at all under the new health care law."
PANTS-FIRE,Ted Cruz ridiculously says Blue Cross Blue Shield 'cancelled' all individual health plans in Texas,"Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz revealed at a campaign stop that he lately lacks health coverage because, he proclaimed, an insurance provider governed by the Obamacare law announced it was ditching the Texas market.""I don’t have health care right now,"" Cruz said. ""I had purchased an individual policy and Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31. So our health care got cancelled. We got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market. And so we’re in the process of finding another"" policy.The day we published this fact check, Cruz’s campaign separately said Cruz hadn’t realized when he spoke in New Hampshire that after Dec. 31, 2015, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas shifted Cruz’s family from the policy it was losing to an HMO plan.Frazier further said Cruz's family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO but planned to be covered by a Humana PPO effective March 1.For this article, we looked into Cruz’s claim that Blue Cross Blue Shield stopped selling health coverage in Texas at the end of 2015, leaving the market, as Cruz put it.Not so, we found, and the ""notice"" Cruz mentioned in New Hampshire may have been sent his way a couple months before the year ended, leaving time to consider options.July 2015 announcementWe didn’t hear back from Cruz about the basis of his statement.At the time, the insurer’s chief medical officer, Dan McCoy, said preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans would not be affordable in 2016, and the company wouldn’t continue to make them available. McCoy also said the company would continue to offer health maintenance organization, or HMO, plans.An HMO requires enrolled patients to pick a primary care physician through which the patient and family members obtain all but emergency services, sometimes by referral. Visits to health care professionals outside of the HMO network typically aren’t covered. PPO plans give more flexibility; you don’t need a primary physician and can go to any health care professional without a referral inside or outside its network, though it costs less to stay in the network.Costs citedThe company further said it couldn’t simply offer the PPO option at higher rates, saying: ""The law requires that we set our individual plan rates based on all of our individual members' claims history. This means that if the costs of one plan are high, it will raise the rates of all other plans, not just the high-cost plan. If we kept the Blue Choice PPO, this would have raised the rates so much for all our other plans that most people wouldn't be able to afford them. By dropping the PPO, we can still offer our other plans at reasonable rates.""McCoy said then: ""We felt it was important to make sure that we offer a sustainable product. Clearly, the individual marketplace is evolving.""To our own inquiry, Edna Pérez-Vega, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, said by email the company’s ""retail market PPO plan, offered directly to individual consumers on and off the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange,"" had become ""economically unsustainable, paying out more than $400 million in claims"" more ""than it earned in premiums.""The company’s announcement suggested its announcement was timed to give customers time to prepare before open enrollment began anew Nov. 1, 2015: ""If you enrolled in the individual Blue Choice PPO plan last year, you won't be able to keep your PPO plan in 2016. We're sharing this information well in advance of the required notification date so that you have plenty of time to research the plan options that best suit your needs,"" the company said.Company: Health coverage available all over TexasWe asked Pérez-Vega if Cruz was right that the company bowed out of the Texas health insurance market.Without mentioning Cruz or his statement, Pérez-Vega replied that the company offers health plans in every Texas county and it’s the only company offering coverage to individuals in 58 of the 254 counties.

PANTS-FIRE,Mike Rogers says Trump appeals to Democrats as much as Republicans,"Can the Republican establishment steer GOP voters away from Donald Trump? Pundits on CNN chewed over the matter recently, with one conservative arguing they shouldn’t try.Rogers said people who don't see this are ""missing the folks on the street who are drawn to his campaign. He's got this whole group of Democrats for Trump, it's an economic issue. … This is a Republican Party attracting Democrats, independents, Reagan Democrats to a message that says this town is broken. The institutions of government are broken. The economy is broken.""We were intrigued by the idea that Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans, so we asked Rogers' office for his sources. We also checked some national polls.So Democratic support for Trump doesn't come close to his level seen among Republican voters.Arguing that Civis polling shows that Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans ""is a misrepresentation of our data,"" she said.But, in contrast, Trump was supported by 73 percent of Republicans, making him nearly four times more popular among Republicans.""If the claim was truly 'Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,' this is completely untrue – ridiculous,"" Mercury CEO Ron Howard wrote in an email.The Mercury poll also found that 14 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton.Our rulingCNN commentator and former congressman Mike Rogers said, ""Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans.""A January 2016 Fox News poll found Trump was nine times more popular among Republicans than Democrats, when matched up against Clinton. A December 2015 Quinnipiac poll found that the billionaire was 20 times more popular.Rogers, in contrast, cited one survey that didn't even poll people who said they leaned Democrat and another that found Democrat support for Trump was only about one quarter of what it was among Republicans.The relevant numbers render Roger's assertion ridiculous."

PANTS-FIRE,Rubio wrongly credits Reagan for 1981 release of hostages from Iran,"As news of Iran’s release of American prisoners spread, Republicans were quick to deny President Barack Obama much credit for the deal.Presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the United States should not have made any concessions to Iran. Part of the deal included Obama granting clemency to seven Iranians charged in U.S. courts with violating economic sanctions against Iran.Host Chuck Todd pressed Rubio on that position: ""So under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages?""Rubio replied: ""When I become president of the United States, our adversaries around the world will know that America is no longer under the command of someone weak like Barack Obama, and it will be like Ronald Reagan, where as soon as he took office the hostages were released from Iran.""We flagged Rubio’s comment as a misleading framing of history. Reagan’s inauguration in 1981 may have coincided with the release of the hostages, but historians say it did not cause it. Instead, the Iranians had tired of holding the hostages, and that the administration of Jimmy Carter did the legwork to get the hostages released.We asked the Rubio campaign for response but did not hear back.The hostage crisis of 1979In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy and held 52 American hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of Carter’s handling of the crisis.The agreement that led to the release involved $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. Sick told us that the Iranians feared having to start negotiations over with a new administration and believed that they had extracted most of the benefits from holding the hostages.Despite the showy announcement, scholars of the period say that Reagan did not play any significant role in freeing the hostages.No Reagan administration officials participated in the negotiations, Farber said, and the Iranians waited to officially release the Americans as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised.""They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages,"" Farber said.""I don't think they were scared into the release,"" Houghton said. ""In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq.""Rubio’s comments are a misreading of history, said Michael Gunter, professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University, who has authored several papers on the 1981 hostage release.""It is clear that Sen. Marco Rubio is falling back on an exaggerated urban legend that the only way to deal with Iran is through implied threats of military retaliation, as President Reagan supposedly did,"" he said. ""Actually, successful U.S. diplomacy then and now played the most significant role.""Our rulingRubio said that Iranian hostages were released in 1981 as Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was ""no longer under the command of someone weak."" In reality, Reagan’s foreign policy approach wasn’t a factor in the hostages’ release, as scholars told us. The Carter administration negotiated the deal months before Reagan’s inauguration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team. Rubio’s claim is an imaginative re-reading of history. We rate the statement Pants On Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"While blaming Scott Walker, Democrats err in saying Wisconsin's ACT rank dropped from 2nd to 41st ","For years, Wisconsin leaders have expressed pride in how the state’s high school students perform on the ACT exam, which assesses students’ academic readiness for college.That is, among states where more than half of the students take the ACT.""Newly released information from the (Wisconsin) Department of Instruction shows a dramatic decline in student ACT results in the past year,"" the news release stated, blaming Republican Gov. Scott Walker.""Test scores dropped Wisconsin from second in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam.""Such a free-fall should have produced blaring headlines.It turns out the Democratic Party came up with 41st on its own -- by mixing apples and oranges.Scores announcedMore than half of Wisconsin's public school students in grades three through eight -- 51.2 percent -- were proficient or advanced in English language arts in 2014-’15, and 43.7 percent did as well in math.That release stressed that the 2014-’15 school year marked the first time in Wisconsin that all juniors (11th grade) in public high schools had the opportunity to take the test. That’s because testing fees were paid by the state.In other words, the more than 64,000 juniors comprised a unique group in terms of Wisconsin students who have taken the ACT over the years.Traditionally, when state rankings on the ACT are done, the scores are for graduating seniors -- and include students from private as well as public high schools.Now to the scores.The ACT -- which tests in English, reading, writing, math and science -- is scored on a scale of 1 to 36.Wisconsin’s composite score for the public school 11th-graders for 2014-’15 was 20, according to the department’s news release.But the way to think about that score is a baseline. There won’t be a score to compare it to until the next set of public school 11th-graders takes the test.Meanwhile, the composite for the more than 46,000 graduating seniors -- the group whose scores are traditionally used to rank the states -- was higher: 22.2.The department made a point to state that comparisons between the two scores -- given that they are for two different groups of students -- are ""invalid and flawed.""But that’s what the Democratic Party did in its news release.The party took the 20 score for Wisconsin’s juniors and plugged it into the ACT database that compares state scores for graduating seniors.The new score put Wisconsin, once again, second among states where more than half of the graduating seniors took the ACT -- behind Minnesota, which had a score of 22.7.Among all states, Wisconsin’s 22.2 ranked 18th.But the Democratic Party, using the 20 score for the group of juniors, said that score meant Wisconsin tied with Kentucky for 41st place.A spokesman for the ACT told us the party’s claim ""cannot be supported"" because it is ""not an apples to apples comparison.""And when we shared that with Brandon Weathersby, spokesman for the Democratic Party, he acknowledged the party had ""flubbed"" the data.  Our ratingThe state Democratic Party said Wisconsin dropped ""from second in the country to 41st"" among states where more than half the students took the ACT college preparation exam.The party admits it erred, by comparing scores of two different groups of students. In fact, Wisconsin ranked second in the 2014-’15 ACT testing among states where more than half the students took the exam, not 41st.For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Advocate links R.I. obesity and bike ownership,"An  organization trying to rally support for cycling sent us a news release highlighting what it said was a ""shocking trend.""The release from My City Bikes, a website and a mobile app that promotes cycling, was headlined:  ""Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent.""And the My City Bikes press release links declining bicycle ownership with rising obesity in Rhode Island. The group even created a graph charting obesity in Rhode Island and the ""global bicycle ownership rate.""The authors aren’t fazed by the fact that they don’t have any Rhode Island-specific data on bike ownership. Their release, which has a Providence dateline, goes on to state: ""While bicycle ownership has been on the decline, locally obesity rates in Rhode Island have more than doubled, from 10.1% in 1990 to 25.7% in 2012.""But, what use is the ""global"" bike ownership data? Is it relevant? Has My City Bikes even cited it properly?The text of the release says that Johns Hopkins researchers identified a decline in bike ownership — from 60 percent in 1989 to 32 percent in 2012. They suggest that statistic came from the analysis of data from 1.25 billion households ""around the world.""They got that wrong. In fact, the Johns Hopkins researchers saw no significant decline when they analyzed bike ownership in those 1.25 billion households. The decline cited by My City Bikes is for 148 countries and does not include China and India.  In the United States, Olufolajimi Oke, a civil engineer and lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, said there’s been a renaissance of bicycle use in many American cities.""Ownership globally and ownership in the U.S. are two very different things,"" Oke said. ""And one has to be very careful about assuming any correlation between ownership and other indicators of public health.""And Oke had no data on Rhode Island.Those are very small numbers.

He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida.""We looked into it and found that there’s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme’s creator was duped by a satirical website.But the viral image — which has been shared more than 3,000 times — does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what’s the real story?""I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,"" he said in the video. Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner.

Rand Paul of Kentucky said that Rubio has opposed border security:""He thinks he wants to be this ‘Oh I am great and strong on national defense,’ but he is the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless.""Is Rubio for an open border? In a word, no. An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio wasn’t for an open border in 2013, nor does he support it this year while running for president.2013 immigration lawAt the time, Rubio told Fox News, ""If you look at what’s being proposed here, this is a dramatic expansion and improvement in border security that I hope will allow finally for this legislation to have the support it needs.""""Well, it’s a dramatic improvement in border security,"" Rubio said. ""It’s a major surge in border enforcement, and I think it’s important to explain why that’s necessary. Look, as I said before, America’s a special country, so special that people are willing to come here no matter what. Even some people are willing to risk their lives and do it illegally. And we’re compassionate about that, but we’re also a sovereign country. We have a right to protect our borders, every sovereign country does, and that’s why this is so critical.""During the debate, he repeated many of those points when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Rubio if he still supports a path to citizenship. Rubio said that Americans won’t trust the federal government to change immigration laws until illegal immigration is under control.""We know what it takes to do that,"" Rubio said. ""It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing 100 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory E-Verify system and a mandatory entry exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays."" A spokesman for Rubio pointed to this statement when we asked about Paul's claim.Paul's team pointed to Rubio's work on the Gang of Eight bill as support for Paul's statement. But that legislation did not create or even suggest open borders. ""If Sen. Rubio was really for open borders, the Gang of Eight bill wouldn't have been 1,198 pages long while doubling the size of border patrol,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an expert on immigration at the libertarian Cato Institute.  Steven Camarota, at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said that ""open borders is always an overstatement."" But the bill would have dramatically increased immigration, he said.Our rulingPaul said that Rubio ""is the one for an open border.""An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio doesn’t support anything like that. He was one of the authors of a 2013 bill that included billions for border security and more border agents. After that bill died in the House, Rubio has repeatedly said that the border must be secured before the Senate can revisit changing immigration laws. The idea that Rubio supports an open border is inaccurate and ridiculous, so we rate Paul’s statement Pants on Fire."

Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before turning to Rubio.""Marco Rubio after the Paris attacks said not only that we should be considering internment, he actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather, and in fact, compared them to the Nazi party,"" Wasserman Schultz said.Did Rubio actually say those things about Muslims?Our research shows Wasserman Schultz distorted Rubio’s recent TV interviews. We will explain each portion of her statement and why it creates an inaccurate picture of Rubio’s comments.Rubio has not called for internment of Muslims Even the DNC admitted the ""internment"" part of her attack on Rubio is completely inaccurate.Rubio has not proposed anything similar to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II for Muslims.DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett claimed Wasserman Schultz had comments by Trump in mind during this part of her interview.""I would have had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer,"" he said. ""I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer.""""What I'm doing is no different than FDR,"" Trump said. ""I mean, take a look at what FDR did many years ago and he's one of the most highly respected presidents. I mean respected by most people. They named highways after him,"" he said, referencing a highway in New York City named for the former president.When asked if he supports internment camps, Trump said no.These comments by Trump, however, don’t add validity to what Wasserman Schultz said about Rubio.Rubio on Muslim cafes and diners According to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio ""actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather.""In the interview, Kelly asked Rubio, ""Donald Trump is suggesting we may need to close mosques that have problems with radicals at the top. What do you say?""Rubio replied, ""Well, I think we need to target radicalism. A lot of it is actually happening online, not simply in mosques. The vast majority of the mosques in America is not...""Kelly asked: ""But the mosques piece is a controversial piece, so where do you stand on that?""Rubio then said:""Well, I think it's not about closing down mosques. It's about closing down any place. Whether it's a cafe, a diner, an internet spot. Any place where radicals are being inspired.""And that we have — the biggest problem we have is our inability to find out what these places are because we've crippled our intelligence programs, both through an authorized disclosure by a traitor, in other words, [Edward] Snowden, or by some of the things that this president has put in place for the support even of some from my own party to diminish our intelligence capabilities.""So, whatever facilities being used, it's not just a mosques. Any facility that's being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States should be a place that we look at.""Closing down any place if it is being used to ""inspire attacks"" is different from flat-out calling for shuttering cafes and diners simply because Muslims gather there.Nazi comparison The last part of Wasserman Schultz’s attack is that Rubio compared Muslims ""to the Nazi party.""This is also a case of Wasserman Schultz twisting Rubio’s words out of context.Rubio replied, ""I don’t understand it. That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi party but weren’t violent themselves. We are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who don't agree with their ideology. This is a clash of civilizations. ... Of course all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups.""Rubio was trying to use an analogy to suggest it would have been ridiculous to avoid using the word ""Nazis"" during World War II out of fear of offending some Germans who were members of the Nazi party.We emailed a spokesman for Rubio to ask if he had addressed this comparison again but did not hear back, and a Nexis search did not turn up other examples of him talking about this.Our rulingAccording to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio has said ""we should be considering internment"" of Muslims, and ""maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather and in fact compared them to the Nazi party.""Rubio has not called for internment of Muslims. This is flatly wrong. Her paraphrases about Rubio wanting to close Muslim cafes and diners and comparing Muslims to Nazis are at least missing context.But to suggest he wants internment of Muslims — to take away their freedom and rights in the United States and separate them from the rest of society — is a grave accusation that leaves listeners with a grossly misleading impression of Rubio’s statements.We rate her claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Grayson wrongly says Cruz not an American,"If Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wins the Republican presidential nomination, don’t expect Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., to send flowers.Grayson, a U.S. Senate candidate, has threatened to file a lawsuit the minute Cruz’s nomination is confirmed, saying Cruz can’t hold the office of president because he’s not an American.  Well, congressman, Cruz is an American by any definition. He travels on a U.S. passport. He's a member of the U.S. Senate, which requires him to be a citizen for nine years. There is no gray area on whether he is an American.We pressed Grayson on whether he actually meant that Cruz is not an American and he raised the idea that his very citizenship, gained through his mother, is flawed.Cruz’s citizenshipNot so fast, warns Grayson. He challenges the premise that Darragh was an American when Cruz was born.""Cruz’s father says that Cruz’s mother became a naturalized Canadian citizen,"" Grayson said through his spokesman Kevin Franck.Grayson argues that under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, there are two ways to lose your citizenship. You can become a naturalized citizen in another country or declare your allegiance to another nation.""If Cruz’s mother did either of these two things before his birth, then she lost her nationality, and Cruz could not rely upon her nationality to claim U.S. citizenship,"" Grayson said.So there is no evidence to support the allegation. We asked Grayson if he had anything else, and his spokesman said he did not.We asked the Cruz campaign to provide proof that Darragh remained an American citizen throughout her time in Canada, such as a residency document that she would need only if she were not a Canadian. They did not get back to us.But according to several immigration lawyers we reached, even if she had taken the Canadian oath, her American citizenship might have been at risk, but she would not have lost it automatically.""Our holding does no more than to give to this citizen that which is his own, a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship,"" the justices wrote.But there's a kicker when it comes to Canada. Henry Chang, an immigration lawyer and partner in the law firm of Blaney McMurtry in Toronto, told us that in 1970, the Canadian oath had this strong language:""I hereby renounce all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign sovereign or state of whom or which I may at this time be a subject or citizen.""A 1973 case in Canada led the country to drop that line. But until then, Chang said the original oath had the potential to impact Americans who adopted Canadian citizenship.""If someone took the old form of the Canadian oath of naturalization prior to April 3, 1973, which included the renunciatory language, it is much easier for the U.S. government to prove that they committed the expatriating act with the intention of renouncing their U.S. citizenship,"" Chang said.But that still wouldn’t automatically cost Darragh her citizenship. Chang and Lenni Benson, an immigration law professor at New York Law School, said that it’s up to the U.S. government to press the point.""If the government never challenged Sen. Cruz’s mother, it is very unlikely that the act of naturalizing in Canada formally would have caused her to lose her citizenship,"" Benson said.In short, as a matter of law and policy, in the eyes of the law, taking an oath elsewhere does not automatically cost you your American citizenship.The facts on the ground speak for themselves. When Cruz was about four, his parents moved to Texas. There is no evidence that the U.S. government ever challenged Darragh’s citizenship. It has always accepted Cruz as an American, based on his mother’s status. To go back and revisit Darragh’s status would put the government in the position of arguing a weak case that runs against a 25-year-old policy.What it takes to be presidentGrayson also spoke about the constitutional requirement for a president to be a ""natural-born citizen.""Most legal experts contend a ""natural born citizen"" means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn’t have to go through a naturalization process to become a citizen. Cruz has said he never went through that process.In general, a child born with at least one American parent can claim citizenship regardless of where the birth took place. Grayson questions this, but that challenge has been rebuffed before. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., faced questions about his eligibility because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was stationed there. That did not prevent him from running as the GOP nominee in 2008.Despite this legal consensus, the fact remains that Supreme Court has never ruled on this matter and until it does, Cruz’s eligibility remains -- theoretically -- a slightly open question.Our rulingGrayson said that Cruz is ineligible to be president because ""technically"" he’s not American.The suggestion that Cruz isn’t an American is patently wrong. He gained his citizenship through his American mother the moment he was born. Cruz holds a U.S. passport and is a duly elected member of the U.S. Senate. While Grayson alleges that Cruz’s mother had lost her American citizenship while in Canada, the source he cited provided no evidence. Grayson provided no proof that Cruz’s mother had become a Canadian citizen.

And our president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria,"" citing one of the Paris attacker’s alleged Syrian nationality.The United States has a long history of taking in refugees from war-torn countries, including some from Syria. But has President Obama decided to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees?Our attempts to learn the basis for Trump’s statement yielded no replies from his campaign.In October 2015, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity made a claim much like the one Trump offered in Beaumont, though Hannity mentioned another country as well, saying: ""The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country.""White House spokesman Eric Schultz sent back an email stating that the U.S. is increasing the ""number of Syrian and other refugees we admit from around the world on an annual basis,"" going up to 85,000 next year and 100,000 the following year.While Hannity further clarified his statement, that he didn’t say all would be Syrian refugees, Trump explicitly labeled all 250,000 as Syrian refugees.Refugee resettlement""We know of no proposal by the administration to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees,"" she said. Table IRefugee Admissions in FY 2014 and FY 2015Region FY 2014 Actual arrivalsFY 2015 Ceiling Revised FY 2015 Ceiling FY 2015 projected arrivals Proposed FY2016 CeilingAfrica17,47617,00020,40022,60025,000East Asia14,78413,00017,30018,20013,000Europe and Central Asia9591,0002,3002,3504,000Latin America/Caribbean4,3184,0002,3002,0503,000Near East/South Asia32,45033,00027,70024,80034,000Regional Subtotal69,98768,00070,00070,00079,000Unallocated Reserve 2,000  6,000Total69,98770,00070,00070,00085,000Trump said President Obama wants to take in 250,000 people from Syria.If so, neither the administration or any other authoritative source had said as much before Trump stumped in Beaumont.

PANTS-FIRE,Fact-checking Trump's claim that thousands in New Jersey cheered when World Trade Center tumbled,"Arguing that there are terrorist sympathizers in the United States, Donald Trump says he saw ""thousands"" of New Jerseyans celebrating after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. ""And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.""""It was on television. I saw it,"" Trump said. ""It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don't like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.""Urban mythWe conducted an exhaustive search of newspaper and television transcripts on LexisNexis, looking for reports from September 2001 through December 2001 that made any mention of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks.Regarding Jersey City, which Trump mentioned specifically, we found two uncorroborated and unsourced mentions.  Neither begins to approach the scale Trump described.""When we got there, they were all in prayer,"" Paterson Police Chief Lawrence Spagnola said.Nor is there any evidence Trump saw these events play out in any way, be it on TV or in person. We reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back.Our rulingTrump said he ""watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" as the World Trade Center collapsed.This defies basic logic.

PANTS-FIRE,Missouri politician wrongly claims 'zero' evidence of swastika incident on Missouri campus,"Turmoil at MU has opened the door for politicians and bloggers to comment on recent racial incidents that fueled protests and a hunger strike. Some latched onto to one incident: a swastika found smeared on a bathroom wall in a campus residence hall.Peter Kinder, Missouri’s lieutenant governor and a GOP candidate for governor, appeared on the conservative radio show ""Breitbart News Daily"" on Nov. 12 to speak about the racial turmoil on the campus.He was asked by host Stephen K. Bannon, ""Are there any facts?"" Kinder replied that evidence of racism is slim. As an example, he talked about the swastika incident.""This incident of supposed feces depicting a swastika on the wall of a bathrooms in one of the halls … has been supported by zero fact,"" Kinder said.Zero fact? We had to look into that.We reached out to Kinder’s press secretary regarding this claim. We didn't hear back from him until after this story first published, but during Kinder’s talk on Breitbart, he cited two sources.We reached out to Department of Residential Life Director Frankie Minor for more information, and he sent us to MU spokesman Christian Basi, who provided the police report.MUPD filed the report about an incident that occurred on Oct. 24. The report describes the incident as ""vandalism."" At the end of the report an officer provides a narrative of what he saw when he entered the restroom of Gateway Hall. ""I noticed there was a swastika drawn on the wall by someone using feces,"" the report reads.Residence Hall Association President Billy Donley released a statement critical of Residential Life’s response. He found out via a flier in the hall. This tweet was posted on the evening of Oct. 29.On Nov. 20, after this story was initially published, Kinder spokesman Jay Eastlick contacted us to say, ""The lieutenant governor misspoke based on information"" from ""two sources that later updated the information. At the time the police report was made public, the lieutenant governor realized it was a real incident that happened, and he stopped referring to it as a potential hoax.""There was no intention to purposefully mislead. He based it on information he had at the time.""Our rulingThe sources Kinder cites updated their articles on Nov. 12 to include the police report.

PANTS-FIRE,Paris-vaccination conspiracy missing facts,"Shots for everyone!Now that’s the kind of sentiment PolitiFact Georgia could get behind. Then we opened the email with that subject line and saw our alert reader meant vaccinations, not Fireball.The question was about a meme that appeared on Facebook and other social media sites in the wake of the terrorist attack in Paris.The wording, over the image of a syringe with a skull inside and the words National Mandatory Vaccinations stamped on top, was awkwardly clear:""While Americans pray for Paris, France, their government sent HR (House Resolution) 2232 to Congress,"" it read.The implication, of course, is that politicians took advantage of an international tragedy to quickly enact controversial legislation (all with a complicit press). Thank goodness for Internet memes, right?The factsWrong.Her proposal would restrict the federal government from awarding preventive health service grants to state-level entities unless that state required all public schoolchildren be vaccinated. Exemptions are in place, only for medical reasons.While in theory that means it would remain a state decision to enact vaccination rules for public schools, the federal government’s deep pockets have historically brought states in line.States that didn’t comply with the new national standard would see 10 percent of their federal highway funds cut. Eventually, every state agreed – and ensured that what amounted to several million dollars in some places would continue to flow.So while the proposal does not officially make vaccinations mandatory, that would likely be the end result if it were passed into law.Except for one major flaw with the meme. There was no movement on the bill since the massacre in Paris.In fact, there hasn’t been any action on the proposal since the GOP-controlled House assigned it to a subcommittee a week after Wilson introduced it.And there likely won’t be.""It’s a Democratic bill, and it doesn’t look like a coordinated move by the Democrats,"" said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. ""This looks like a lone wolf type bill. It hasn’t moved because it’s not going to.""The conspiracySo then why the meme?The theme park outbreak – and the first reported American death from measles in 12 years – led to a new law in California that revoked ""personal belief"" exemptions and required all children in public schools without medical reasons to be immunized.""While I absolutely understand the freedom to say no to healthcare, I don’t think it’s a freedom to extend when it’s to protect your child or to you put others at risk with your choice,"" said Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""It’s not a bad idea to consider this on a national level.""The anti-vaccination movement is one place where the left and right converge and from that, can move onto greater conspiracies, said Mark Fenster, University of Florida law professor who studies conspiracy theories.The Paris attacks, then, are a ""false flag,"" an operation designed by conspiring forces – this time the media, government and pharmaceutical companies – to distract Americans from the goal of dangerous immunizations.A similar ""false flag"" theory is touted by some in connection with the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. There, the conspiracy goes, the government staged a horrible massacre in a bid to take citizens’ guns.""The anti-vaccine movement is obsessed with their fear of vaccines, and they view any government effort to require their use as a threat,"" Fenster said.""Vaccines may have nothing to do with Paris, but the movement views it as a way to ram through this law while no one is watching,"" he added.Our rulingA meme making the rounds on social media takes a different tack on the Paris terrorist attacks.It claims the tragedy has been a distraction to government efforts to mandate vaccinations for all public schoolchildren.There is a proposal for a similar law, but there has been no movement on the proposal since a week after it was introduced last spring.That’s the last bit of truth to the meme.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump says Obama administration is pushing refugees toward states with GOP governors,"As growing numbers of governors were expressing opposition to the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their state, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised the ante in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham.Is the administration sending refugees to Republican-led states but not Democratic ones? In a word, no.Syrian refugee resettlement by stateBefore we delve into the numbers, it’s important to note that the Republicans currently have a commanding lead in governorships -- 31 states held by the Republicans compared to just 18 held by the Democrats. (The governor of Alaska is an independent.)Given this imbalance, it would not be surprising to find Republican-led states ending up with more refugees overall than Democratic-led states. So we will look at not just the raw totals per state but also the average number of resettlements per state for each party.On a per-state basis, Republican-led states have accepted more Syrian refugees so far in 2015, but not dramatically more. Indeed, only one state accepted more than 200 refugee resettlements -- California, which is led by Brown, a Democrat.Who decides where refugees go?Even if Trump had been right on the numbers, experts in refugee resettlement said partisan politics plays no role in determining where refugees end up.Put simply, ""the decision on refugee placement is based first on where the refugee might have family ties or other connections, and then largely on the capacity of voluntary agencies to provide case-management services,"" said Bill Frelick, director of the Human Rights Watch Refugee Rights Program.Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS (originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), said that at the beginning of each fiscal year, the State Department works with nine national voluntary agencies -- six faith-based, three nonsectarian -- to allocate the number of refugees per agency.  The nine groups are the Church World Service, the Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, HIAS, the International Rescue Committee, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Migration and Refugee Services, and World Relief.""The capacity at the local level is determined in consultation with local municipalities and state refugee coordinators, who are state officials, along with other community stakeholders,"" Hetfield said. ""The states do not have veto power, but they are very much consulted in the process.""Every Wednesday, Hetfield said, the nine agencies meet to decide which agency will take which newly approved refugees. Files on each refugee household approved for resettlement by the Department of Homeland Security are reviewed with an eye to the size of the household, the gender and age distribution, the educational and employment backgrounds of adult members, whether family members or friends are already living in the United States and are willing to help, and whether there are special considerations, such as a serious health problem.If an agency has a pre-existing relationship to the household -- such as having resettled other family members in the United States -- the case will typically be assigned to that agency, said Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University. Otherwise, the agency will attempt to allocate new refugee households according to numbers of people the agency feels capable of handling, she said. For instance, an agency will consider whether a local affiliate has adequate language resources available for the newly arrived refugees.In other words, the agency -- not the administration -- allocates the refugees to a particular city. ""The administration does not try to influence the process,"" Hetfield said.Some states tend to get higher rates of refugee resettlement because family links are taken into account, Hetfield said. ""That is why Michigan has so many refugees resettled there -- it is where Iraqis and Syrians have expressed a preference, due to family or other community links,"" he said. According to the AP data, Michigan has accepted 195 Syrian refugees this year.So this, and not the fact that Michigan has a Republican governor, is why the state ranks relatively high in refugee resettlement, he said.Our rulingTrump said the federal government is sending refugees to states with governors who are ""Republicans, not to the Democrats.""The numbers show that Democratic-led states recently received almost as many refugees as -- and by some calculations, even more refugees than -- Republican-led states on a per capita basis.Beyond that, though, Trump is wrong to say that refugees are resettled as a form of partisan political vendetta. People who have taken part in the process say that the administration leaves it up to private groups, mostly faith-based groups, to determine where refugees should go, with the decision based on family links, the availability of language resources locally and the ability of local groups to handle the new workload -- not politics.

PANTS-FIRE,Viral graphic says Japan keeps out radical Islam through strong restrictions on Muslims,"Amid rising concerns about terrorist attacks by ISIS, we’ve seen an uptick in chain emails and viral images about Islam.One viral image points to Japan as an example of a country that keeps out radical Islam by cracking down on all forms of Islam and its adherents, implying that this is a good model for the United States to follow.The graphic is a simple black-and-white block of text with the headline, ""Japan keeps Islam at bay by putting restrictions on Islam and ALL Muslims."" The graphic then mentions a variety of ways in which Japan supposedly keeps tight control over the Muslims in its midst:• ""Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims""• ""Permanent residency is not given to Muslims""• ""Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned""• ""In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taught""• ""Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries""• ""One cannot import a ‘Koran’ published in the Arabic language""• ""Muslims must follow Japanese law and language"".• ""The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim laws""• ""Muslims cannot even rent a house in Japan""• ""There is no sharia law in Japan""We wondered whether the graphic is accurate. To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, ""permanent residency is not given to Muslims,"" the ""propagation of Islam"" is banned, ""one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,"" and ""Muslims cannot even rent a house.""We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect.""The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood,"" said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions.Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong.He said Japan doesn’t discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that ""propagation"" of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported.As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said there’s no specific animus toward Muslims.These four claims ""are totally unfounded,"" said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. ""It is disturbing that such an email is circulating,"" she added. ""These claims are simply ridiculous.""Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked.""I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,"" Abe said. ""I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence.""Our rulingThe graphic says that in Japan, ""permanent residency is not given to Muslims,"" the ""propagation of Islam"" is banned, ""one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,"" and ""Muslims cannot even rent a house.""Each of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base. We rate these claims Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Trump says China gets an advantage from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"Donald Trump likes to talk about how China takes advantage of the United States economy, so it wasn’t surprising to see him bring up the People’s Republic at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee.When asked a question about the recently released Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, Trump took to bashing China.""The TPP is horrible deal,"" Trump said. ""It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.""""If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States -- China in particular, because they're so good. It's the No. 1 abuser of this country,"" Trump said. ""And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.""To give Trump the benefit of the doubt, we asked some experts if there is any way China could benefit ""through the back door"" from the TPP. The short answer: no.An overview of the TPPThe TPP involves 12 countries: the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam.The deal is meant to reduce trade barriers between these countries by lowering tariffs on goods, coordinating regulations and more.The deal could also ""provide stronger legal protections to drug companies, lengthen the term of copyright protection, give foreign investors a new way to challenge countries' laws and regulations, and much more,"" according to Vox.The deal was negotiated in secret before being released to the public.Again, we should make it clear: China was in no way involved in TPP negotiations.Can China somehow benefit?We asked experts if there was any way China could possibly take advantage of the TPP. The experts all agreed: The trade deal will most likely negatively impact China.The only way China might benefit, Trachtman said, is if it has investments in any of the countries involved in the deal. For example, if China has invested in plants in Vietnam, they might become more valuable to China; however, the benefits of those investments would be ""small and rather insignificant.""Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow in trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, said Trump’s assertion that China continuously manipulates its currency is completely off-base.""Some people are all wrapped up in this issue of currency manipulation. I don’t think that’s applicable to the Chinese,"" Pearson said. ""It was never clear to me that China artificially lowered the value of its currency to gain an export advantage (in the past).""We should also note that the TPP actually does mention currency manipulation. A side agreement in the trade deal -- separate from the 6,000 page main text -- says the 12 countries involved agree not to artificially deflate the value of their currencies. However, there is no enforceability provision -- meaning the clause is more of an honor code than a strict regulation.""There aren't many economists who would be comfortable with an enforceable currency manipulation clause,"" says Emily J. Blanchard, an associate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. ""A binding currency provision would tie policy makers' hands at precisely the wrong time: when a central bank-- like the U.S. Federal Reserve--  needs to respond to a downturn in the local economy.""The only way China could benefit from the TPP, Pearson said, is if it experiences the ""spillover benefits"" of increased trading between the 12 countries involved in the TPP.""There is some possibility that there will be trade diversion away from China and more trade between other TPP member countries,"" Pearson said. ""That’s a potential negative. However, that may be entirely offset by the greater level of economic activity that we should expect to see in the TPP member countries.""Blanchard said she finds it ""highly implausible"" that China would benefit from the TPP. If it does, as Pearson suggests, so would the rest of the countries involved in the agreement.""TPP is going to encourage greater trade integration among its signatories in Southeast Asia and beyond,"" she said. ""That will inevitably suck some of the oxygen out of China’s local economy, as supply chains reorient toward other TPP countries, including the U.S.""""If TPP passes, its enforceable labor and environmental provisions, curbs on state-owned enterprises, strong (intellectual property) laws, and transparency requirements will redefine the rules of the road in global trade agreements,"" she said. ""This is definitely not the same rulebook that China would have written.""All three experts agreed that China could try and join the TPP in the future, but it first has to meet the requirements laid out in the agreement -- something we shouldn’t expect to happen any time soon.In the days after the debate, Trump was asked if he knew that China was not part of the trade deal. Trump said he did and repeated his claim that China could benefit. But he still didn’t explain how that would actually work.Our ruling Trump said the Trans Pacific Partnership ""was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.""Not only is China not a part of the TPP, but the experts we talked to all agreed: The TPP isn’t exciting news for China. There’s a chance that China could join the TPP down the line, but not without robust changes to its economy. Until then, China doesn’t stand to gain much from having trade diverted to other countries.Trump can’t blame everything on China. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Carly Fiorina says 'Obamacare isn't helping anyone',"The Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare to some -- is a perennial target of Republicans. But at the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina made a particularly strong statement about the law’s ineffectiveness.""Look, I'm a cancer survivor, okay?"" Fiorina told moderator Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network. ""I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone.""Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry, but during the debate, she listed a number of problems she has with the law.""It is crony capitalism at its worst,"" she said. ""Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies. … Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies.""Fiorina also said that ""Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers, that we have information to shop wisely for our health care.""Reasonable arguments can be made against the law and its many provisions. But is no one at all getting any actual help from the law? We decided to take a closer look.Here are a couple of more ways people are benefitting:• Americans no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions: Smaller than the previous categories, but unknown.There is some overlap between these categories. But whatever the number is, it’s in the tens of millions -- and most of those people, Gaba said, ""would disagree that it's ‘not helping anyone.’ ""Jonathan Oberlander, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, added two additional categories of Americans who have benefited from the ACA:• Americans with private insurance who now have access to preventive services at no charge: Unknown, but likely in the millions.""The statement is utter nonsense. Put simply, it is a wild exaggeration that amounts to a lie,"" Oberlander said. ""You can certainly debate the overall impact and desirability of Obamacare. But to say it isn’t helping anyone is to ignore both reality and overwhelming evidence to the contrary.""Policy experts who have mixed feelings about the law or oppose it outright say that some of these benefits have come at too high a cost, or have left more people significantly hurt than significantly helped.For instance, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who has provided unofficial advice to Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the law has squeezed out many of the more limited-benefit and catastrophic-coverage plans that beneficiaries may have liked, forcing them to pay for more expensive policies.""This has been a problem for people above 300 percent of the poverty line who get small subsidies, and it’s been a real problem for people above 400 percent of the poverty line who get no subsidy,"" Wilensky said.  Michael Tanner, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said there have been both winners and losers, and that he expects that ""the losers far outnumber the winners.""That said, both Wilensky and Tanner agreed that Fiorina went too far in saying that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone.""""People on expanded Medicaid or who were previously uninsured and substantially subsidized in the exchange are better off than they were,"" Wilensky said, even if ""they may or may not be as well off as they could be.""Tanner added that, despite his qualms with the law, ""you can’t truthfully say that no one has benefited. Even if you believe that the previously uninsured are paying too much for crummy policies under the ACA, as I do, I don’t think you can say that none of them have benefited at all. That’s a pretty low bar, of course. If you flew across the country dumping money from an airplane, some people would benefit.""Our rulingFiorina said that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone.""Even taking the low end of estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the ACA, in big ways (such as securing insurance for the first time) or smaller ways (paying less for drugs under Medicare Part D). One does not have to buy into every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price tag to acknowledge that lots of people have benefited from it.

Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public RadioLin said he’s ""not optimistic"" that Alejo’s prediction will come true.""This uninsured motorist problem is perplexing. It’s very difficult to mitigate,"" the professor said.He said AB 60 has the potential to reduce uninsured driving in California, though he and state insurance and motor vehicle officials said it was too early to say whether the law is having that impact.California does not require proof of insurance to obtain a driver’s license. It does, however, require insurance to register a vehicle.Insurance experts say Alejo’s claim about ""everyone"" being insured on California’s roads is far from true.But they point out that the percentage of uninsured motorists has been falling in recent years. Nationwide,  it dropped from 14.9 percent of drivers in 2003 to 12.6 percent in 2012, according to the research council.Compared with a few years ago, Schmid said the cost of auto insurance is less and more people are working, both of which persuade people to carry insurance.The CHP data also point to fewer uninsured motorists. It shows a significant drop in citations issued for drivers who failed to show proof of insurance in each of the past five years.Our rulingAssemblyman Luis Alejo says ""everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured.""This statement is clearly a dream, with no basis in fact.While indicators show the number of uninsured motorists is dropping, CHP officers are still very busy citing uninsured drivers. They wrote more than 66,000 tickets for uninsured drivers from January through August.Insurance experts call Alejo’s claim inaccurate and wishful thinking. They also strongly doubt the problem will ever be fully solved.We rate the claim Pants On Fire, which we define as a statement that is ""not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."""
PANTS-FIRE,Ben Carson's Pants on Fire claim that no signer of the Declaration of Independence held office,"Soon after it was posted, we began hearing from readers asking us to check one of his claims.""You are absolutely right — I have no political experience,"" Carson wrote in the initial version of his post. ""The current Members of Congress have a combined 8,700 years of political experience. Are we sure political experience is what we need. Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience. What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God. They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King. They were willing to risk all they had, even their lives, to be free.""We were already looking into Carson’s initial Facebook comment when the wording change was made. We’ll address both versions here.The signers had 'no elected office experience'Many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had held elective office before joining the Continental Congress, which produced the declaration. We found a long list, so take a deep breath before you start reading.That’s at least 28 of the 56 signers -- about half, and we were conservative in who we counted. The real number may be higher.Either way, Carson’s original claim, that ""every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience,"" is way, way off.The signers had 'no federal elected office experience'The edit Carson made to the Facebook post doesn’t help his case, since there was no federal government before the Declaration of Independence was signed. This makes his entire claim illogical, experts say,""Of course they did not have federal elected office experience because there was no federal government at the time -- we were a British colony,"" said Michael Gerhardt, scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center and professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina.""It makes about as much sense as saying none of them had been to the moon,"" Lewis said. ""Of course they hadn't, because it was an impossibility at that time. No one could possibly serve in the federal government before there was a federal government, at least in the absence of time travel.""Carson’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Our rulingBoth the initial and the revised versions of Carson’s claim are far off base. About half or more of the declaration’s signers had held elective office previously, a reality that severely undercuts Carson’s overall point that the drafting of the Declaration of Independence showed how a lack of political experience can produce landmark political achievements. As for his later addition of ""federal"" to the comment, this makes the claim nonsensical, since there was no federal government prior to the signing of the declaration.We rate Carson’s claim Pants on Fire. "

PANTS-FIRE,Chris Christie says Bernie Sanders’s plan is 'to raise your taxes to 90 percent',"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie drew chuckles at the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo., when he described the Democratic field as consisting of ""a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist -- and for the sake of me, I can’t figure out which one is which.""He went on to single out Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of those three Democratic candidates and a self-described democratic socialist.""The socialist says they’re going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don’t tell you they’re going to raise your taxes to 90 percent to do it,"" Christie said.That echoed a claim made by Donald Trump at a rally in Richmond, Va., on Oct. 14, 2015.At that rally, Trump called Sanders a ""communist"" and said that tax hikes would come for everyone, not just billionaires.There’s no doubt that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the richest 1 percent:But does Sanders want to tax the average Americans at 90 percent as well? Here, we’ll recap the problems we found with Trump’s claim and address why Christie’s claim was equally problematic.What Sanders has saidThe confusion may stem from comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy. In an interview with CNBC, Sanders he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high.And beyond what his camp told us, a review of his past comments — one from 2008, and four more from this year — Sanders doesn’t seem like he’s committed to any figure:• Nov. 5, 2008 on Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto: Sanders said of the top tax rate, ""No, of course, it is not going to be 90 percent."" Pressed by Cavuto for a figure, Sanders said, ""Neil, I’m not going to develop tax policy in a three-minute segment on your show.""In short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific — ""over 50 percent"" — and it would only affect a tiny fraction of Americans.Nothing is certain but taxing corporationsAnd that’s the point that’s even more problematic with this claim -- who Sanders’ supposed 90 percent tax would affect.Both Trump and now Christie have indicated that essentially everyone will be hit by a 90 percent tax hike. With Trump, this rate would supposedly be levied on ""you people"" in the audience at his rally. Christie, for his part, said Sanders would ""raise your taxes to 90 percent.""But whatever big hike a President Sanders would seek to implement -- and based on his comments it would be something south of 90 percent -- would be targeted mostly at the wealthiest Americans, including hikes to the tax on the largest estates and on trading transactions and an elimination of tax deferrals for U.S. corporations located abroad.Beyond this, there’s some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. Indeed, one tax expert cautioned against speculating because Sanders has been so vague about his proposals.""There is not enough substance to (Sanders’) proposals for anyone to have analyzed them,"" Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said when we checked Trump’s original claim. ""Organizations typically wait until there is a fully formulated plan before they try to model them. Sanders is not anywhere near that point yet.""Our rulingChristie said that Sanders’s plan is ""to raise your taxes to 90 percent.""Sanders hasn’t released an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. But based on his previous comments and proposals, the tax policies Sanders is advocating are targeted at corporations and affluent Americans.Sanders has dismissed the notion that he wants to set marginal tax rates for billionaires at 90 percent. And on the whole, his tax proposals so far do not envision raising ""your taxes"" -- that is, those of ordinary Americans -- to anything approaching 90 percent.This is a grossly misleading characterization of the extent and scope of Sanders' plan, so we rate Christie’s claim Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94917f97-e53e-4d00-8f83-c9f2de668891"

PANTS-FIRE,"Fact-checking Sean Hannity's claim on the U.S. accepting 250,000 refugees","The waves of refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq have given the conflict there a domestic immediacy in the race for the White House. While Europe is absorbing the great majority of refugees, some are headed toward the United States. The question is, how many?About 250,000, according to Fox News host Sean Hannity. During an interview with Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush on Oct. 19, 2015, Hannity worried that ISIS would try to infiltrate the arriving masses.""You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq,"" Hannity said. ""The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country.""""We can’t take 250,000 refugees,"" Bush responded. ""I’ve never heard that, and that would be impossible to imagine logistically for us to screen.""What gives?A refugee crisisAdd those three numbers together and you get 255,000 refugees, Hannity said.That math is right, but none of it makes Hannity's claim accurate.The Associated Press report Hannity cited is discussing the total number of refugees admitted to the United States worldwide.But Hannity, in his remarks Oct. 19 and Oct. 20, was discussing refugees coming from Iraq and Syria, fearing they might be infiltrated by ISIS or al-Qaida. Here, again, is what Hannity said Oct. 19:""You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq,"" Hannity said. ""The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country.""And Oct. 20:""You see what’s happening in Europe, there’s a huge backlash because of Syrian refugees and Iraqi refugees and the cost … We’re being told by our National Intelligence Director that ISIS and al-Qaida, not if, they will infiltrate the refugee community. This president has committed to nearly 250,000 coming to America.""Those refugee spots are not awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. They are allocated specifically by region. Europe has an annual limit. So does Africa. So does Near East/South Asia, the area that includes Syria and Iraq.In Fiscal Year 2013, for example, the United States accepted 4,205 Cuban refugees and 16,000 from countries in East Asia.So what’s changing?For Fiscal Year 2016, the Obama administration has proposed raising the cap to 85,000 refugees -- an increase of 15,000 refugees over the previous year. In 2017, the cap would move to 100,000. Many, though not all, of those extra spaces would be used for Syrian refugees, the State Department says.Here is a breakdown of the State Department’s proposal by region for FY 2016:Refugee Admissions in FY 2014 and FY 2015Proposed Refugee Admissions by Region for FY 2016Region FY 2014 Actual arrivalsFY 2015 Ceiling Revised FY 2015 Ceiling FY 2015 projected arrivals Proposed FY2016 CeilingAfrica17,47617,00020,40022,60025,000East Asia14,78413,00017,30018,20013,000Europe and Central Asia9591,0002,3002,3504,000Latin America/Caribbean4,3184,0002,3002,0503,000Near East/South Asia32,45033,00027,70024,80034,000Regional Subtotal69,98768,00070,00070,00079,000Unallocated Reserve 2,000  6,000Total69,98770,00070,00070,00085,000The Migration Policy Institute gathers data to track the movement of people across the globe.

But that’s all lost on the viewing audience, who gets no idea of the time frame and would reasonably think he’s talking about only refugees from Syria and Iraq.From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2015 and is saying it will accept 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017.Over those three years, that’s about 6,000 refugees more than the recent annual average.

PANTS-FIRE,"Dan Patrick says Planned Parenthood does nothing but profit from killing babies, selling body parts","Texas Lt. Gov.

Look, they’re nothing more than a referral service. They pretend to care about women’s health. But they don’t have professionals even giving any information to women except referring them to another clinic. They don’t  have equipment. They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies.""Cavuto: ""Well, I understand your passions, sir. But they do a little bit more than that.""Patrick: ""Very little.""We focused our sights on whether Patrick is right that Planned Parenthood solely provides abortions.To our request for backup information, Patrick’s spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by phone: ""We don’t have anything further to add.""Past fact checksThe most prevalent listed contraception service was ""reversible contraception"" for women (2.1 million services). The most common cancer screening was ""breast exams/breast care"" (487,029 services). That story said that a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history; she said Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed.According to the July 2015 list, Planned Parenthood’s most common pregnancy services in 2013 were pregnancy tests (1.1 million services). Other identified services include HIV tests (704,000 services); emergency contraception kits (1.4 million services) and Pap tests (378,692 services).CaveatsPer all these figures, it’s worth repeating caveats offered by PolitiFact in 2011:--First, many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of ""services"" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared with what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations.--Second, Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, though the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. This basically means observers must accept their accuracy more or less on faith.Planned Parenthood In TexasWe also asked Gutierrez about Planned Parenthood in Texas making fetal tissue available for research. ""Planned Parenthood Greater Texas and Planned Parenthood South have never participated in fetal tissue research projects,"" she replied by email, ""and have no plans to do so. While Planned Parenthood Center for Choice (in Houston) does not currently participate in a fetal tissue study, they have taken part in such worthy studies in the past, following all laws and the highest medical and ethical standards. These studies hold the potential to cure disease and save lives. They last partnered with UTMB,"" the University of Texas Medical Branch, ""on a study to prevent miscarriage.""Our rulingPatrick said Planned Parenthood is ""nothing more than a referral service. … They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies.""To the contrary, Planned Parenthood provides family planning and other women’s health services, including abortions and there’s been no confirmation it sells body parts.We rate this incorrect and ridiculous statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"In next chapter of Sanders-Clinton conspiracy theory, graphic takes aim at CNN's polling operation","A few days ago, we waded into the debate over a conspiracy theory circulating among some supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders -- the one that has CNN, among other media outlets, keeping favorable post-debate poll results for Sanders under wraps because the network, and other parts of the media establishment, are in the tank for Hillary Clinton.Nonetheless, we’ve decided to wade in again after a reader sent us a Facebook post that added a new wrinkle to the alleged CNN conspiracy.The reader sent us a post that showed an image of results from a CNN-ORC International poll taken between Oct. 14 and 17. On the image, two columns were circled in red -- two columns of sub-results by age group for a question about how favorably or unfavorably the respondent views Hillary Clinton.The two columns show responses for survey participants ages 18 to 34 and ages 35 to 49. Every possible answer in those columns has been marked N/A -- ""not applicable.""The creator of the image was dumbfounded, slapping this comment on the image in big red type: ""CNN's Crap Polling: No one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton?""The reader who contacted PolitiFact wondered whether the image creator’s question was legitimate, so we took a closer look.Bottom line: It’s all a misunderstanding about how CNN reports the results of its surveys. (After we emailed questions to the person who had posted it on their Facebook page, we didn’t receive a response, but the post was pulled down. We saved a screenshot, above.)The easiest way to debunk the graphic’s assumption is to look a few columns to the right. There, one can find a heading that reads ""under 50,"" with 74 percent of respondents in that age group saying they feel favorably about Clinton, 23 percent saying they feel unfavorably, 3 percent saying they have no opinion and 1 percent saying they’ve never heard of her. (Our real question: Who belongs to the 1 percent who have never heard of Hillary Clinton?)So this column of poll results clearly shows that people under 50 did tell the survey takers about their opinions about Clinton.What about those mysterious columns full of ""N/A""?""Crosstabs on the following pages only include results for subgroups with enough unweighted cases to produce a sampling error of +/- 8.5 percentage points or less,"" CNN wrote. ""Some subgroups represent too small a share of the national population to produce crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. Interviews were conducted among these subgroups, but results for groups with a sampling error larger than +/-8.5 percentage points are not displayed and instead are denoted with ‘N/A.’ ""In other words, for the age ranges 18 to 34 and 35 to 49, the survey reached too few people to produce a statistically valid sample -- so to avoid publishing questionable numbers, CNN simply reported them as ""N/A.""This pattern -- categories with larger sample sizes given specific figures, and those with smaller sample size marked ""N/A"" -- is echoed elsewhere in the full document.""The CNN/ORC polls are highly regarded,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ""They are one of the few partnerships to provide us subgroup data, which is invaluable. The Facebook question does a disservice to the poll.""Our rulingThe Internet graphic accused CNN of being such an incompetent pollster that it found that ""no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton.""This is based on a misreading of the CNN-sponsored poll. Two age-range subcategories produced too few respondents to qualify as statistically valid results under CNN’s threshold, which was plainly spelled out in the survey-results document. The claim is even debunked on the graphic itself -- it showed a category with actual results for respondents under the age of 50. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Trump: Bernie Sanders wants to tax 'you people' at 90 percent ,"At a recent rally in Richmond, Va., Donald Trump called Bernie Sanders the c-word — ""communist"" — and suggested that Sanders’ plans for wealth redistribution extends beyond targeting Trump and other billionaires.Under Sanders, Trump said, tax hikes would come for everyone.A few days later, Sanders dismissed Trump’s comments in an interview on ABC’s This Week.It’s clear that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the ""1 percent."" But does he want to tax the average Americans standing before Trump at the Richmond rally at 90 percent as well?Sanders hasn’t released a tax plan yet, and we searched Lexis Nexis and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying that rate across the board.We asked the Trump campaign how the GOP frontrunner knew what Sanders is proposing, but we didn’t hear back. However, he may be distorting comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy.Just like IkeEarly in his campaign, Sanders drew alarm when he said in an interview with CNBC that he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high.Looking at his past comments — one from 2008, four from this year — Sanders doesn’t seem like he’s committed to any figure:In short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific — ""over 50 percent"" — and it would not affect all but a tiny fraction of Americans.Nothing is certain but taxing corporationsAnd that’s the point that’s even more problematic with Trump’s claim -- who Sanders’ supposed 90 percent tax would affect.Most of the taxes that Sanders has actually proposed in writing would not apply to ""you people.""

Also, he said, ""they were opposed to emancipating the workers, giving them the rights to vote and to organize"" in unions.Lane added: ""The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called ‘German socialism’ or ‘Aryan socialism.’ This meant citizenship and privileges only for ‘Aryans’ (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others.""Our rulingVillalba said Sanders ""admits he is a democratic socialist… Nazis were Democratic Socialists.""Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. The Nazis were not democratic socialists. Whether or not Villalba intended to link Sanders to the Nazis, his tweet neatly did the job.We find this claim historically inaccurate and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"Ben Carson says Mahmoud Abbas, Ali Khamenei, Vladimir Putin knew each other in 1968 Moscow","It sounds like the opening to a joke: A young Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk into a Soviet-era Moscow university …But it’s a claim that was made with a straight face by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson -- on national television, three times.Then, on Oct. 8, Carson said much the same thing to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer.Putin ""already has substantial ties in the Middle East,"" Carson said. ""In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin.""And then again to Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC on Oct. 9: Putin ""has longstanding relationships with people in that area. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was in that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that was when they first became familiar with Putin.""Really? Three future world leaders -- and three people many Americans consider adversaries -- found themselves kicking around a university in Moscow in 1968, building ties that would serve them decades later? We had to check it out.When we asked Carson’s staff whether they had any supporting evidence, aide Ying Ma wrote back, ""Thanks for your inquiry. We are not in the habit of providing Googling support to the media. If there is a specific aspect of Dr. Carson's statement that you wish to challenge, please let us know and we can go from there.""We did have difficulty finding any support for the claim, and we forwarded what we found to the campaign but did not hear back.Here’s a rundown, point by point.Mahmoud AbbasThe portion of the claim dealing with Abbas has the most supporting evidence, but even here it’s not all that clear-cut.It’s fairly well documented that Abbas -- the head of the West Bank-based Palestinian government -- did do some academic work in the Soviet Union.But there’s no hard evidence that Abbas was at Lumumba in 1968, which is what Carson said.Ali KhameneiOn the other hand, Alfoneh continued, Khamenei’s biography says he spent a ""clandestine life"" in Tehran between March 1966 and March 1967, after which he was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The existence of this ""clandestine"" period may have fed the rumor that he spent time studying in Moscow. Certainly a period studying in the ""godless"" Soviet Union would be something Khamenei -- the head of a theocracy -- would want to keep under wraps.In an interview, Alfoneh said he isn’t convinced of the Khamenei-in-the-Soviet-Union claim. ""I'm very skeptical,"" he said.So where did this rumor come from?A half-dozen experts on the region unanimously told us that they doubted Khamenei ever studied in the Soviet Union -- or that he did so in 1968, when he would have been 29.""I've never seen it corroborated,"" said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.John Limbert, a professor of international affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy, called the idea ""bizarre.""And David Houghton, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at King’s College of London, called it ""unlikely in the absolute extreme.""""The Soviet Union is the absolute last place where one could expect to find Khamenei at any stage in his career, and I personally do not believe that he ever studied there or had any links to Putin,"" Houghton said. ""It looks like a rather daft conspiracy theory to me.""Vladimir PutinThe biggest problem for the Putin portion of Carson’s claim is the calendar: In 1968, Putin would have been 16 years old.According to his official biography, ""in 1960-1968, Vladimir Putin attended Primary School No. 193 in Leningrad. After the eighth grade, he entered High School No. 281, a chemistry-focused magnet school under the aegis of a technology institute, completing his studies there in 1970.""""It’s pretty difficult to imagine that he could have met Messrs. Abbas and Khamenei under any circumstances at age 16 in Moscow, unless he ran into them randomly on the street on some kind of school or family trip — if, indeed, they were actually there,"" said Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.In addition, Putin grew up in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). That is a 9-to-10-hour car ride from Moscow and Patrice Lumumba University.""He studied between 1970 and 1975 in the law faculty of Leningrad State University,"" said Richard Sakwa, a professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent. ""The claim by Ben Carson is garbled rubbish.""A defenseKincaid made the case that Carson was saying Abbas and Khamenei could have been agents of the KGB, and if they were, Putin, who rose to colonel in the KGB, would have known them.""Carson was clearly saying that Putin, as a former KGB colonel and later head of the FSB, the new name for the KGB, would have knowledge of Abbas and Khamenei attending Patrice Lumumba University, a KGB-controlled institution,"" Kincaid told PolitiFact. ""That made them subject to KGB influence, if not KGB agents. Whether Putin personally met them in his younger years is beside the point. … Please report these facts rather than nitpick Carson on the ages of the various players.""We hereby report those ""facts."" Still, this isn’t what Carson said.Our rulingCarson said, ""In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin.""This is one of the more bizarre claims we’ve heard so far in the 2016 presidential campaign, and that’s saying something.Abbas may have attended the university, though we don’t know for sure, or when. No credible evidence has yet surfaced to place Khamenei as a student in the Soviet Union -- ever, much less in close proximity to Abbas, or in 1968. And Putin would have been a teenager in 1968, attending school 450 miles away.The idea that the three men developed lifelong ties as students in the late-1960s-era Soviet Union is ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"Pope, Creflo Dollar and their rides","The image that showed up the PolitiFact Georgia inbox had already pinged wildly around social media.The top part showed the Pope waving from the back seat of the small four-door Fiat 500L. Below it was a photo of a driver purported to be College Park megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar, tooling in a shiny silver roadster with an EU license plate.The reader wondered, could that actually be the lead pastor of World Changers Church International behind those sunglasses, zipping along somewhere in Europe? We wondered too, and decided to do some digging.Breaking down the ridesThat the top part of the meme was accurate was clear from news coverage, and the social media response, during Pope Francis’ recent visit to the United States.The Pope made news for what he said but also for his use of the Italian-made subcompact car.News reports said Vatican police, not the Holy See, selected the car, which has a starting list price of $19,935. But they did so on Francis’ specific request of modesty and simplicity for his ride.Determining who was behind the wheel in the roadster proved more of a challenge.Dollar is a recognizable face who has made his own headlines, most recently from a fundraising video to help his ministry buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650 luxury jet.Though the church removed the video after a backlash, the church’s board of directors later said it still intended to replace Dollar’s jet with the Holy Grail of luxury jets.""We plan to acquire a Gulfstream G650 because it is the best, and it is a reflection of the level of excellence at which this organization chooses to operate,"" the directors said in a prepared statement.So, the idea of Dollar photographed in a sports car didn’t seem all that outlandish. But with the shades covering much of the driver’s face, it was hard to tell just who was behind the wheel.Focusing on the car, though, brought the navigator into much clearer view.We sent the image to Jim Donnelly and Tom Comerro, the senior editor and editorial assistant, respectively at Hemmings Motor News.The official word from the bible for car collectors: the silver roadster is a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Stirling Moss edition.Only 75 of the vehicles were produced, with a starting list price in 2009 of 750,000 Euros, or north of $1 million for a supercharged ride that could reach 217 miles per hour with no windshield.Searching for who has access to that ride led us to a similar picture, of a different angle and a driver with the sunglasses off.Modesty and prosperitySimply put, the image itself is flat-out wrong.And what about the context of those 1,000 words the picture is trying to say?Much has been made of the ""simplicity"" sought by Pope Francis ever since he took a vow of poverty as a Jesuit priest. He took the subway as a cardinal in Argentina and news reports say he humbles himself in either a Ford Focus or a 1984 Renault when getting around the Vatican.Dollar, meanwhile, is well-known for preaching the ""prosperity gospel,"" which says that God wants all believers to do well in all aspects of their lives, including finances.Dollar listed two Rolls Royces – one paid for by his congregation and another by members of his ministerial association of those pastors he has trained – in a 2007 congressional inquiry into the tax-exempt status of a handful of such megachurches.World Changers spokesman Vic Bolton said Dollar no longer uses those $250,000 automobiles and instead drivers a regular Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan (which new lists for $96,000) that’s about 8-10 years old (in the $65,000 range).""It’s a nice car, but it’s no Aston Martin,"" Bolton said. ""I don’t think he drives a Mercedes to send a message. He drives a nice car because that’s what he wants. True prosperity is having options.""The same could be said about Pope Francis. The Catholic Church, too, is mum about its wealth.But a 2014 report found hundreds of millions of Euros tucked away, off the official church balance sheet. And the Vatican bank manages $7.3 billion in assets and keeps $20 million in gold reserves in the U.S. Federal Reserve.That is enough to buy and sell more than a few of those fancy roadsters.So the real difference – beyond the scale of wealth – is between the ideologies of those Christian faiths, said Kate Bowler, a professor of American Christianity at Duke Divinity School in North Carolina.The Catholic Church is heavily collective, with a focus on the church’s responsibility as a group. In the prosperity gospel, responsibility falls entirely to the right-believing individual.Often, the proof of that belief shows up in flashy cars or extravagant churches, such as the 8,500-seat World Changers dome that has become a landmark in College Park.But Bowler said the faith encourages family connections and community connections as truly prosperous, as well as focusing on sharing the gospel so that others may find that success.""It doesn’t really matter if it’s not true,"" Bowler said of the meme, ""because it does capture the essence of a faith that requires proof of wealth to be true.""That means Kanye West being confused for Creflo Dollar adds to, not diminishes, his message, she added.""I don’t think Creflo would mind at all,"" she said. ""He’s a victor and that language of triumph and the wealthy car demonstrates to believers that God is with them.""Our rulingA viral image making its way around social media purports to show Pope Francis getting around town in a small compact sedan, while Georgia’s megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar zips along in a stylish two-seater sports car.The roadster driver is actually rapper Kanye West, making the image clearly false.Even the context – trying to draw distinction between a supposedly humble servant of God with an apparently audacious one – ignores that both the Pope and Dollar have ready access to lavish luxuries.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Dan Patrick says all crime, in estimate, committed by about 15 percent of population","Urging a positive view of law officers ""that you and your family depend on every day,"" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went on to say the vast majority of citizens are law-abiding.A curious listener emailed us. Could Patrick's 100/15 statement be so?Patrick’s backupAsked how Patrick reached his figures, his spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by email that Patrick ""uses 15% as the number of citizens that commit 100% of crime as an indicator of the number of criminals in the total population to make the point that most citizens are law-abiding. That is higher than statistics would indicate,"" Garcia said, writing that according to law enforcement data, ""we have approximately 2.2 million people in jail in America and another 5 million on probation and parole. That is roughly 2.5% of the total population that has been convicted of a crime including non-violent drug offenses.""Garcia declined to elaborate on how that 2.5 percent justified Patrick’s 15 percent figure.That ratio was the lowest since at least 2005, when there were 3,160 people per 100,000 U.S. adults in the ""correctional population,"" the report said.A pair of criminologists told us the numbers offered by Patrick didn’t make a case for the unfamiliar 100/15 formulation.Broadly, Brame and other criminologists we reached said they weren’t aware of a factual way to get to an accurate statement that ‘x’ percent of the population commits all the crime.But there have been studies suggesting a subset of residents commit about half of crimes. Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Dallas, said by email: ""A routine finding in the criminological literature is that about half of the crime is committed by a very small fraction of the population, around 5-8 percent depending on the sample and methodology used. This finding has been replicated in many different studies around the world. The bottom line is that a small fraction of the offending population is responsible for a great majority of crime."" Piquero said most of the studies tracked residents only into late adolescence or early adulthood.The Philadelphia studies and othersSince the 1960s, researchers have probed how often youths come into police contact, consistently finding that a subset of people account for around half of the crimes reported to police.Our rulingPatrick said: ""100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population.""Sure, not all of us commit crimes, a point that’s patently obvious. When it comes to the specifics of this ""15 percent"" declaration, however, we found nothing to back it up — including the statistics offered by Patrick’s office.Invented stats meet our definition of a ridiculous claim.

PANTS-FIRE,Chart shown at Planned Parenthood hearing is misleading and 'ethically wrong',"Congress may have avoided a government shutdown related to Planned Parenthood funding — at least so far — but the controversy over the women’s health organization looks like it’s here to stay.Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sparred with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards during a high-profile hearing on Sept. 29. One of their face-offs originated with a chart Chaffetz flashed, indicating that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than ""life-saving procedures"" in 2013, a complete reversal from just seven years ago.The chart features a pair of lines crossing — one headed upward (abortions) and the other headed downward (cancer screening and prevention services).When referring to the chart in the hearing, Chaffetz said, ""In pink, that's the reduction in the breast exams, and the red is the increase in the abortions. That's what's going on in your organization.""""This is a slide that has never been shown to me before,"" Richards responded. ""Excuse me, my lawyer is informing me that the source of this is actually Americans United for Life, which is an anti-abortion group. So, I would check your source.""""Then we will get to the bottom of the truth of that,"" Chaffetz agreed.The chart, we found, gives a misleading impression. The numbers listed on the chart are based on actual statistics, but they are small and were hard to read during the televised hearings. The chart’s most prominent feature — the much larger crossed arrows — suggests a conclusion that’s flat wrong.We reached out to Chaffetz’s office but did not hear back. A spokesperson for Americans United for Life told PolitiFact that the graphic is accurate and honest.Experts, however, begged to differ.""That graphic is a damn lie,"" said Alberto Cairo, who researches visual communication at the University of Miami. ""Regardless of whatever people think of this issue, this distortion is ethically wrong.""Dueling axesChaffetz’s chart falls into a category known as a dual-axis chart. On the left side, cancer screenings and prevention services are plotted in the millions. On the right side, abortions are plotted in the hundreds of thousands.But the way the chart was assembled is problematic.For starters, dual-axis charts are particularly susceptible to showing spurious correlations. With two axes, trend lines can be exaggerated and manipulated, as most people ignore the axis labels that put the numbers in context.""It forces your brain to see a relationship that isn’t there,"" Cairo said. ""As economist Gary Smith once said, ‘If you double the axes, you can double the mischief.’ ""Second, it’s even more inappropriate to use a dual-axis chart when comparing equivalent measures (in this case, the number of services performed by Planned Parenthood) using different scales, said Enrico Bertini, a professor at New York University who studies data visualization and who called the chart ""scandalous.""  Typically, dual-axis charts are used to compare lines that represent different things — ""for instance, abortion rates and cost,"" said Bertini. ""But in this case the unit is the same.""  ""You cannot put two measures, one in the millions and one in the hundreds, without making it explicit,"" Cairo said. ""We map data into visual properties — height, length, color — but we need to keep the proportions. We cannot force the data to adopt a shape we like.""Finally, perhaps the most egregious decision was to not label the axes. Experts told us that, given this decision, they cannot rule out purposeful deception.""By claiming to combine these two lines into one graph and then omitting the y-axis, we are being misled into to making a false comparison of two non-equivalent contexts,"" said Noah Iliinsky, a visualization and information designer based in Seattle. ""The graph is absolutely misleading, and intentionally so.""Iliinsky also said he saw ""propagandized design choices"" in the choice of the arrowheads, which suggest a ""strong continuation of these trends, which we don’t know to be true.""Corrected chartsWith guidance from the experts, we compiled the number of abortions and cancer screenings/prevention services from Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (we could not find a report from 2008). Here’s what the chart should look like:As you can see from the chart, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. It is true, however, that the organization now provides fewer cancer screenings and preventive services, though medical experts said that’s more likely due to changing health guidelines than the organization prioritizing abortions.Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood and for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer. Medical groups used to recommend an annual Pap, but now suggests the test every three or five years for most women.Planned Parenthood also provides an array of other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment — services that have gone up by 50 percent since 2006 — as well as pregnancy tests. Here’s how all of the services have changed from 2006 to 2013:A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood told PolitiFact that the number of services provided in each category tend to fluctuate from year to year for myriad reasons, ranging from changes in laws and medical practices to the opening or closure of Planned Parenthood clinics.Megan Christin, a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, speculated that the decline in contraception could be due to a growth in the use of IUDs, which last for five to eight years.Overall, if we compare abortions and non-abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood — and if we use standard scales on the axes, we see largely consistent trend lines for both:Our rulingAt the hearing, Chaffetz presented a chart that showed the number of abortions at Planned Parenthood rising higher than the number of preventive services and cancer screenings between 2006 and 2013.But that’s inaccurate, disputed by the chart’s own, hard to read numerical labels. In fact, there were three times as many cancer screenings and prevention services as abortions in 2013. Experts in data presentation said this was an egregious example of using a chart to mislead.We rate the claim Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,"Viral, flawed post compares Honduras, Switzerland on gun laws and homicide rates","There’s a reason they don’t call it Factbook. The latest example of a misleading factoid gone viral casts restrictive gun policy as a backfiring failure, with two countries as case studies.On one side of the post is Honduras, with a population of 8.2 million people and a government that ""bans citizens from owning guns."" Honduras has ""the highest homicide rate in the entire world,"" the post claims.On the other side is similarly populated Switzerland, which ""requires citizens to own guns"" and has the ""lowest homicide rate in the entire world.""A reader wanted to know if the post’s counterintuitive message is right.Here’s why it’s flawed.Population We’ll pause on the numbers and start with an overriding issue with the post’s premise. It holds up population as the sole constant that justifies comparing these countries’ gun policy and violence.There’s really no point in comparing the challenges of Honduras, a lower middle-income country in Central America beleaguered by corruption and violence from the drug trade and gangs, to Switzerland, an affluent country nestled in western Europe.""Of course, what you want to do is compare countries where everything else is the same, except for guns and gun laws, to see if guns and gun laws have any effect,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health.  ""Switzerland and Honduras are not even close to being the same in many aspects of their society that will influence the levels of violence and homicide.""""The determinants of homicide rates are multiple and not very well understood, and guns laws may indeed be one among many, many determinants,"" said Christopher Mikton, World Health Organization technical officer for violence prevention. ""But to point them out as the sole cause is wrong.""But even if you choose to ignore the macrofactors, the post messes up the particulars, too.RatesSwitzerland’s homicide rate is among the lowest in the world, but the meme goes too far in saying it’s the very lowest. By the UN and WHO measures, the most recent Swiss intentional homicide rate is 0.6 deaths per population.LawsThe post is wrong about the gun laws in each country.Honduras doesn’t ""ban"" citizens from owning guns.The Small Arms Survey says the most popular gun in Honduras is the 9mm handgun, ""which can be legally purchased and owned"" — undermining the meme’s claim that Hondurans are banned from owning guns. Because this weapon is banned in nearby Mexico, the UN has said the difference in laws fosters the exchange of illegal weapons between the countries.The disparity in homicide rates and gun control laws showed ""gun legislation, on its own, means little in terms of gun violence,"" the Insight Crime analysis found.But, again, Switzerland does not require ""citizens to own guns.""""As soon as they have finished their military service — typically around 30 years of age — they have to return the gun,"" he said.Our rulingThe viral post aims to jolt readers with a counterintuitive implication: Gun laws can lead to deadly unintended consequences.But the post is flawed on many levels. The comparison based on similar population size alone is shallow, and non-scientific. Moreover, Switzerland does not have the world’s lowest homicide level, and the post is flatly wrong about the laws in each country.This claim rates Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump says the unemployment rate may be 42 percent,"During the televised press conference in which he announced his tax plan, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump returned to a claim he has made before -- that the official unemployment rate -- currently 5.1 percent -- woefully undercounts the percentage of people who are unemployed.During the Sept. 28, 2015, media event, Trump described an unemployment rate in the range of 5 percent as ""such a phony number.""""The number isn't reflective,"" he said. ""I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent."" He continued, ""5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent.""We’ll start by offering a refresher about how the official unemployment rate is calculated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.Not factored into this calculation are people who are not currently looking for work.This is the portion of the population that alternative measures -- such as those cited by Trump -- attempt to factor in. Broadly speaking, supporters of these alternative measures say that not working, regardless of the reason, is tantamount to being unemployed, and should be reflected that way in the official measurements.The 42% calculationStockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a ""plausible measure of the potential workforce."" If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you run the numbers, ""the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent,"" Stockman wrote.Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.In the column, Stockman himself acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.""Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers,"" he wrote. ""We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else.""Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.Stockman’s calculation ""treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all.""In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.Taking another whack at the numbersAll of this spotlights a long-running debate among economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than the one traditionally used. It’s within the economic mainstream to believe that the traditional method that produces 5.1 percent is too limiting, even if the far more permissive calculation that produces 42 percent is vastly overstated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics itself offers a more expansive alternative measurement of labor ""underutilization"" called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially ""unemployed"" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.Currently the U-6 rate is 10.3 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see if we could come up with a percentage that approaches Trump’s 42 percent.We started with the 94 million Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. Here’s a summary.CategoryPeopleNeither working nor officially unemployed, age 16 and up, civilians and noninstitutionalized only94.0 million9.7 million37.8 million8.7 million2.9 million1.4 million10.3 million2.0 million9.0 million745,000 (estimate)Remainder:11.5 millionIn other words, there are perhaps 11.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working (though they could be full-time students between 34 and 65, undergoing job training over age 29, or be affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early).If you turn this into a new type of ""unemployment"" rate, it comes out to 16.4 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 percent, but it’s only a small fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.As Burtless told us previously, most of those suffering from being ""out of work"" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.""The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits,"" he said.Our rulingTrump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump’s 42 percent. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."

Here’s the exchange.Muslim?According to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. (He was not raised in any particular faith as a child.) Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life.In office, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.Born in Kenya?As part of his ""birther"" crusade, Trump said in 2011, Obama's ""grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth.""Our rulingAn audience member at a Trump campaign event said, ""You know our current president is (Muslim). You know he's not even an American.""PolitiFact and others have repeatedly debunked both of these claims -- that Obama is Muslim and that he wasn’t born in America. Against all odds, they live on.Obama is Christian and was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.We rate the audience member’s claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Ben Carson says pediatricians realize need to cut down number and proximity of vaccines,"CNN’s Jake Tapper noted that a backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak in California. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has linked childhood vaccines to autism despite the medical community debunking that myth.During the second GOP debate, Tapper asked Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon who now lives in West Palm Beach, if Trump should stop making such a claim.Carson then turned the subject to the scheduling of vaccines:""But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time. And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that’s appropriate.""We contacted Carson’s campaign to ask for his evidence and did not get a reply.VaccinesMore than 90 percent of children entering kindergarten have been immunized with recommended vaccines in accordance with this schedule. But some parents have sought to delay vaccines or reduce the number given per visit, while others have rejected them entirely, despite recommendations by the scientific community.That’s not a good idea, according to the report.""Delaying or declining vaccination has led to outbreaks of such vaccine-preventable diseases as measles and whooping cough that may jeopardize public health, particularly for people who are under-immunized or who were never immunized,"" wrote researchers.The researchers also concluded that there is ""no evidence that the schedule is unsafe.""""Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise,"" wrote Karen Remley, executive director of the academy.Despite the scientific consensus, pediatricians are facing pressure from parents to delay vaccines.A survey of 534 pediatricians done for the American Academy of Pediatricians in 2012 showed that 93 percent reported that within a typical month some parents asked to spread out the vaccinations. The vast majority thought these parents were putting their children at risk for disease but thought they would build trust with the families if they agreed to the request.While there is anecdotal evidence that some pediatricians have acquiesced to parents’ requests to delay vaccinations, that decision is not rooted in public health or science.""There is no evidence that pediatricians 'recognize' that we give too many vaccines in too short a time,"" said Mark Schleiss, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Minnesota. ""Far from it. ... There is no evidence at all that spacing vaccines out or changing the schedule would improve health or help children.""Eugene R. Hershorin, chief of the division of general pediatrics at the University of Miami, pointed to what happened a decade ago when England and Japan delayed the DTaP vaccine, a combination vaccine used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.""There was a tremendous increase in the incidence of pertussis in both countries, leading them to re-institute the schedule immediately,"" he said.Our rulingCarson said pediatricians have cut down on the number and proximity of vaccines because they recognize there have been ""too many in too short a period of time.""Leading medical organizations have concluded that the scheduling of vaccines -- including multiple ones at once -- is safe.While there is evidence that some parents ask pediatricians to delay vaccines, that’s a decision based on parents’ wishes and isn’t based on scientific evidence.There is no evidence that pediatricians are cutting down the number and proximity of vaccines based on any conclusion by them that there have been too many in too short a period of time.Carson has provided no evidence to support his claim.

PANTS-FIRE,Internet posts say three Democratic senators 'took bribes from Iran' to support nuclear deal,"There’s no question that the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran has unleashed passions. Some of the passions directed against the deal are clear from a recent series of Web posts accusing Democratic lawmakers of accepting bribes from Iran to approve the deal.""After more fake suspense, (Minnesota Democratic Sen.) Al Franken, another IAPAC-backed politician who also benefited from Iran Lobby money, came out for the nuke sellout.""Senator Jeanne Shaheen (of New Hampshire), the Iran Lobby’s third Dem senator, didn’t bother playing coy like her colleagues. She came out for the deal a while back even though she only got half the IAPAC cash that Franken and Markey received.""The article continues, ""Democrats in favor of a deal that will let a terrorist regime go nuclear have taken money from lobbies for that regime. They have broken their oath by taking bribes from a regime whose leaders chant, ‘Death to America.’ ""To understand the charges, we’ll break down the claims into manageable pieces.First, did the three Democratic senators receive money ""from Iran""? Second, is it true that the senators ""took bribes""? And third, have these ""bribes"" only gone to Democrats?Did the senators receive money ‘from Iran’?It’s not logical to assume that just because a group has ""Iranian"" in its name that it’s a stooge for the government of Iran.In reality, the groups in question -- PAAIA and IAPAC -- are organizations that represent Iranian-Americans. That’s a key difference: Often, people emigrate to the United States because they oppose the government of their previous country. Just because a senator received money from a group of Cuban-Americans doesn’t mean they are effectively taking money from Fidel and Raul Castro. In fact, and certainly in the case of Cuba, it’s much more likely that the group’s members can’t stand the Castro regime.However, the group itself strenuously denies that it is a front for Iran’s theocratic government.""We have no connection to the Iranian government -- no, none at all,"" said Morad Ghorban, director of government relations and policy for the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. ""We’re a non-profit, non-partisan, non-religious organization that is really here to serve the interests of the Iranian-American community before policymakers and the American public.""When asked which form of government would work best for Iran, 69 percent of Iranian-Americans said Iran should be a secular democracy, compared to just 9 percent who said it should be any form of an ""Islamic Republic."" The breakdown was much the same in the prior poll, from 2011.Such views undercut the notion that the organization is a puppet for the mullahs.The accusation that the group is a front for the Iranian regime ""has no basis,"" said Vali Nasr, dean of the John Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an expert in the region. ""This organization is supported by Iranian-Americans in leadership positions across high-tech, finance, law and other sectors. It has no support from Iranian government. Its board and membership includes Republicans and Democrats and has a wide perspective on political issues.""Did the senators take bribes?Given all the possible influences on a lawmaker’s vote -- the views of constituents, pressure from party leaders, lobbying by other interest groups, even their own gut feelings -- it’s hardly obvious that the support of Iranian-Americans was the factor that tipped the balance for them on the Iran deal. But even if you assume that it did represent the tipping point on their vote, it’s hard to consider this a ""bribe.""In bribery, it’s the agreement to vote a certain way that matters, added Brett Kappel, a partner in political law at the firm Akerman LLP.""Making a campaign contribution to a senator in the hope that he will vote for a resolution when it comes to the floor is not a bribe – there has to be an agreement"" to do something, he said.And there’s even less reason in this case to believe these transactions would qualify as bribes. Markey, Franken and Shaheen all received their support from the group during the 2014 election cycle. At that point, there was not even a certainty that there would be a nuclear agreement, much less what it would contain.Have these ‘bribes’ only gone to Democrats?Actually, no: The group has given donations in a bipartisan fashion, including to a variety of Republicans who are almost certain to vote against the nuclear deal.During the 2014 campaign cycle, IAPAC gave money to such Republicans as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Reps. Randy Forbes of Virginia, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, John Mica of Florida, and Ed Royce of California, and the National Republican Congressional Committee.In the 2012 campaign cycle, the group supported GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and John Cornyn of Texas, Rep. Peter Roskam and the National Republican Congressional Committee, as well as a Democrat who has come out against the agreement, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. And in the 2010 campaign cycle, the group supported Sen. Charles Schumer, another Democratic opponent of the deal, as well as Republican Rep. Randy Wittman of Virginia.The original article did note that ""the Iran Lobby had even tried, and failed to turn"" Flake and Schumer into deal supporters. But it gave no indication of the breadth of Republicans who received support from the group, the lack of which communicates an unbalanced perspective on the group’s political leanings.The article’s author, Greenfield, said the focus on Democrats was justified. ""The acid test of influence is action,"" he said. ""The final determination will be seen when the vote happens. Currently, however, no Republicans are backing a deal ... while the Democrats listed in the article are. Other Democrats who have received Iran Lobby money have come out against the deal and were not in any way deemed traitors.""""Some of the candidates we supported in the past … are not going to be supporting this deal,"" said Ghorban of PAAIA. ""There are other issues where we will work with them.""Our rulingPosts on the Internet said that Markey, Franken and Shaheen ""took bribes from Iran"" on their way to supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran.The ""bribes"" in this case are campaign contributions, and there’s no evidence they are anything more than that. The donations came from a group of Iranian-Americans and not the government of Iran, and the allegation glosses over the fact that many top Republicans who oppose the nuclear deal also received the same type of support from the same group.This claim is wildly inaccurate. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Jeb Bush: Planned Parenthood isn't involved in women's health,"Planned Parenthood is not involved in women’s health issues, said Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush.""When I was governor, we expanded those programs through community-based organizations, and that’s something I think the federal government needs to continue to do,"" Bush said. ""I, for one, don’t think Planned Parenthood ought to get a penny, though. And that’s the difference because they’re not actually doing women’s health issues. They're involved in something way different than that.""While ""women’s health"" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood’s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.)Here’s the section of the report breaking down services provided in 2013:Our rulingBush said, Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues.""It’s hard to reconcile Bush’s statement with the fact that -- setting abortion procedures aside -- Planned Parenthood offered more than 10 million services in 2013.

PANTS-FIRE,Liberal group tags Bobby Jindal as 'anchor baby',"Billionaire Donald Trump’s immigration proposals include forcing Mexico to pay for a wall at the border, tripling the number of immigration officers, and ending the long-standing practice of birthright citizenship.There are exceptions but generally speaking, if you are born in the United States, you can claim citizenship regardless of the immigration status of your parents. This goes back to the 14th Amendment."" ‘We have to end birthright citizenship to stop anchor babies,’ says Republican Bobby Jindal whose noncitizen parents arrived in the U.S. four months before he was born and used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby.""The part we’re fact-checking is the claim that Jindal’s parents gained citizenship through him.People define ""anchor baby"" in different ways. Some use it when food assistance and medical care for a low-income child of undocumented immigrants produce indirect benefits for the parents. That doesn’t apply in Jindal’s case.For one, his parents had healthy incomes when they arrived, and more to the point, Occupy Democrats focused on another meaning of anchor baby — a child through whom a noncitizen can craft a path to full citizenship.Coming to AmericaHowever, regarding Jindal’s personal timeline, the post is accurate. Jindal’s parents moved from India to Baton Rouge, La., on Feb. 1, 1971. Jindal was born on June 10, 1971. So that’s just about four months later.At the time, his mother had a scholarship to study nuclear physics at Louisiana State University, and his father, an engineer professor, was working for a subsidiary of the Kansas City Southern Railway. A couple of years later, Amar Jindal took a new job with the Exxon oil company. Jindal’s mother Raj Gupta earned two master’s degrees, one in physics and another in nuclear engineering. She ultimately worked for the state Labor Department in information technology.Mike Reed, communications director in the Louisiana governor’s office, told us that Raj Gupta became an American citizen in 1976, and Amar Jindal followed 10 years later in 1986.Why does that matter? Because those dates mean that Jindal’s birthright citizenship played no legal role in his parent’s citizenship applications.Let’s see why.21 is the magic numberTwo leaders in immigration law explained that Jindal only could have helped his parents become citizens when he had turned 21 years old.If Jindal’s citizenship had made any difference, the earliest his parents could have been eligible would have been 1992, five years after he turned 21.When his mother became a citizen in 1976, Jindal was 5, and in 1986, for his father’s naturalization, he was 15. It’s not even close.""If both parents had lawful permanent residence, then it doesn’t make a difference if they had a kid,"" said David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.Lenni Benson, a law professor at New York Law School, also said that given the Jindals’ circumstances, the son’s citizenship was ""irrelevant.""""Once they secured immigrant visas and became lawful permanent residents, they could seek naturalization on their own after five years of residence and meeting other requirements,"" Benson said.At the end of the day, there is no evidence that Jindal was an ""anchor baby.""Occupy Democrats did not return a message to the group’s email address.Our rulingThe experts we reached told us Jindal’s citizenship was irrelevant, bringing Occupy Democrats' claim into the realm of ridiculous. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, Michele Bachmann did not say there are no 'illegal Mexicans in China' thanks to the Great Wall","Donald Trump’s border wall proposal has earned him high praise from his political predecessor, former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., according to a meme circulating on social media.It’s a tidy confluence of past and present presidential campaigns, as Trump’s lead in the Republican field is often compared to Bachmann’s early success in the 2012 presidential election.Several readers asked us to look into whether Bachmann actually made the comments. We obliged and found no evidence backing the claim. We also reached out to Bachmann’s spokesperson, who said the former member of Congress never made the remarks.The first thing that had us raising our eyebrows was some of the text that accompanied the meme when it was posted on Facebook.""What do you think about a Trump/Bachmann ticket in the 2016 Presidential race?"" it said. ""Former Rep. Michelle Bachman (sic) told Fox News' Jenna Jameson she ‘admired Donald's leadership and vision’ and also complimented Trump on his reality show success, ‘If Donald can do for this country what he did for Arsenio Hall America will be great again.’ ""We also searched three comprehensive databases -- Nexis and CQ, which aggregate transcripts, and Critical Mention, which records video and closed captioning -- and found no record of Bachmann ever making those comments.To our knowledge, she hasn’t appeared on Fox News since Trump announced his candidacy. She has commented on and praised Trump in several interviews on different networks, though she has never mentioned his wall proposal. Here’s a rundown of her Trump-related remarks:Before Trump, Bachmann championed the idea of a border fence for years, but we couldn’t find an instance when she’s evoked the Great Wall of China. ButTrump has.Bachmann’s spokeswoman told us that Bachmann agrees with Trump’s views on immigration, adding, ""Trump's emphasis on stopping the current tidal wave of immigration is in sync with a plurality of voters, as polls demonstrate a great majority of Americans believe.""Our rulingA meme says that Bachmann said, ""The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago.

PANTS-FIRE,Dick Black says Jill McCabe backs selling fetal parts for profit,"Undercover videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discuss harvesting fetal tissue appall state Sen. Dick Black, R-Loudoun.A staunch opponent of abortion, Black is seeking to link the controversy to his Democratic opponent this fall, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician.McCabe ""supports selling late term abortions for bigger body parts,"" Black tweeted on July 28. He renewed the charge on Aug. 4, tweeting that McCabe ""supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable.""So we decided to examine Black’s charge.Let’s start with some background. The controversy over fetal parts erupted last month when the Center for Medical Progress, a conservative group that opposes abortion, released a nine-minute video secretly taped during a 2014 lunch with Deborah Nucatola, Planned Parenthood’s senior director of medical services. The center says the tape shows Nucatola talking about performing partial-birth abortions to keep body parts intact in order to ""sell"" them.The video put Planned Parenthood on the defensive and ignited Republican calls to end federal funding for the group and for investigations into its practices.Planned Parenthood provides a wide array of health services to women -- 97 percent of which are not related to abortions. The organization has denounced the secret taping as a misleading campaign by anti-abortion activists. Officials of the group say fetal tissues are integral to medical research and that the organization does not profit from their sale.Allegations by Black and others that profits were made raise legal questions. Federal law bars clinics from selling fetal tissue for gain. It’s legal, however, for clinics to donate the tissue for scientific research and receive reimbursement for their ""reasonable"" costs in providing the tissue.Cecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, has said the organization’s clinics don’t sell fetal tissue for profit but do provide it for research and are reimbursed for their collection costs. In the video, Nucatola discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided.Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact National that the fees Nucatola discusses don’t appear geared to making a profit.Many of the sales are made to brokers -- middlemen who process the tissue and then sell it to researchers at significant markups. A vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells, for example, can sell for about $24,000. The brokers say their prices reflect their high costs of buying medical equipment and employing skilled technicians.Now, let’s get back to Black’s claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit.Chris Lore, Black’s legislative assistant, told us the senator’s statement isn’t based on any statement from McCabe explicitly supporting the practice. Instead, Lore said, it’s implicit by the support she’s received from Planned Parenthood.The group has endorsed McCabe and has given her a 100 percent rating. Lore also noted McCabe has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia.In addition to those endorsements, Lore noted that amid the controversy, McCabe was quoted in a newspaper saying she still supports Planned Parenthood.""You take those two facts into consideration and it seems her position is pretty clear,"" Lore said.Lore forwarded a copy of a Loudoun Times-Mirror story in which McCabe was asked about whether she still welcomed Planned Parenthood’s support in the wake of the controversy.""I'm a doctor, and I take care of patients, including women,"" McCabe was quoted as saying. ""Women need health care choices and Planned Parenthood provides that. That's kind of the end of it for me.""We contacted Lore a second time for more information. After we spoke with him, Black posted this message on Twitter: ""PolitiFact is desperate to give cover to @DrJillMcCabe to give cover for supporting late term abortions. #MediaLies #PPSellsBabyParts.""We also reached out to McCabe to see what her position was on late term abortions and selling tissue for a profit. We heard back from Kyle Sutton, her campaign manager.""Jill McCabe does not support late term abortions, but as a doctor she does understand that there are unfortunately circumstances where a pregnancy proceeding to full-term is not in the best health interest of either a mother, or child,"" Sutton wrote in an email. What about selling fetal tissue for profit?""Jill does not support selling fetal tissue for profit, the same way she does not support any illegal activities, because they're illegal,"" Sutton wrote.We also asked McCabe if she supports Planned Parenthood providing tissue for research at cost, without a profit.""As a doctor, Jill McCabe understands life-saving medical research,"" her campaign manager wrote in an email.Our rulingSen. Dick Black says McCabe, ""supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable.""McCabe indicates she supports late term abortions in instances when it is ""in the best health interest"" of the mother or child. She says she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit.Black links McCabe’s qualified support for late term abortions to what he says is an effort to profit from the sale of ""large baby parts.""  In effect, he’s accusing his opponent of supporting an illegal practice because U.S. law bans the sale of fetal tissue for profit.It’s incumbent of Black to prove his inflammatory claim and he offers nothing but speculation.We rate his statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump: 'The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over',"In the first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race, billionaire developer Donald Trump -- the leader in recent polls -- made a splash.Early in the debate, Fox News’ Chris Wallace, one of the moderators, pressed Trump on some of his past statements about undocumented immigration -- the signature issue of Trump’s campaign.Wallace asked Trump, ""What evidence do you have, specific evidence, that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?""Trump cited conversations with ""border patrol people"" who told him that it was true: ""Our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid, and the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them, they don't want to take care of them. Why should they, when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?And that’s what’s happening, whether you like it or not.""The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey found Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong.What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact.""Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’ "" Massey said. ""Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border.""Other experts sided with Massey.""Immigrants come to work or to join family,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. ""And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave.""""No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object,"" added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration.""While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups,"" Smith said.But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added.About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is pushing people out.It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said.Trump ""does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population,"" Massey said. ""People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate.""In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well.Our rulingTrump said, ""The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over."" Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are ""bad"" or not, we found no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States. For the second time, we rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Rush Limbaugh says Austin effectively banning barbecue restaurants,"Conservative Rush Limbaugh told listeners that liberal Austin has moved toward wiping out local barbecue joints.On his July 28, 2015, program, the commentator read from a web post stating the Austin City Council in April 2015 ""passed a preliminary plan"" restricting smoke from barbecue restaurants. Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the contemplated requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members ""these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.""""It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue,"" Limbaugh echoed. What ""kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway?"" he added.Smoke pouring from commercial barbecue smokers has been a hot Austin topic, in particular pitting a new South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way has reduced the value of their homesteads.And did the council adopt a plan amounting to a ban on ‘cue restaurants?Citing a websiteThat post said the council had passed a preliminary plan to restrict smoke from barbecue restaurants, continuing:""The city council’s current proposal will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke. These restrictions will require at least $100,000 in extra investments for most barbecue restaurants as they will be forced to buy extra smokers along with severely expensive diffusers, and in some cases will have to lease or purchase more property.""One business expert told council members that these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin.""It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue.""We didn’t connect with the unnamed authors of that post. Nor did our query to Limbaugh draw a reply.Limbaugh’s claim, Dean said, is not true.Blowing smoke in AustinCredit for publicly suggesting the city regulate smoke from restaurants belongs to Austin City Council Member Sabino ""Pio"" Renteria, whose idea to require smoke mitigation wasn’t embraced by pitmasters who said purchasing expensive ""smoke scrubbers"" could kill barbecue stands inside the city limits. ""It will force 99 percent of Austin BBQ places to either close or move out of town,"" John Mueller of John Mueller Meat Co. said in a statement.In March 2015, Renteria said he was revising his original proposal to have it apply only to restaurants and mobile food vendors within 100 feet of residential property—down from 150 feet. He also said he wanted to look at other smoke-mitigating options besides scrubbers.At a March 31, 2015, work session, council members questioned how regulating smoke emissions would affect small businesses and longtime businesses, and whether there might be a way to target regulations at new businesses or ones that had been the subject of complaints.Committee recommendationsThe other council committee also gathered. But it hadn’t made a recommendation by the day Limbaugh suggested Austin barbecue was about to vamoose.Then again, Ora Houston, the Austin City Council member who chairs the Health and Human Services panel, earlier made the motion against the city limiting barbecue smoke by ordinance that was adopted by the Economic Opportunity committee. By phone, Houston responded to our inquiry by saying she continues to prefer that the city address smoke concerns one by one. ""I would not be a supporter of a motion to have a citywide ban on barbecue smoke,"" Houston said. ""That’s what the city is known for, music and barbecue.""Our rulingLimbaugh said Austin is ""effectively"" imposing ""a ban on barbecue restaurants.""In early 2015, there was worry that a mandate that barbecue restaurants limit smoke from smokers would have that impact. However, the council didn’t adopt such a regulation and we sniffed out no factual indication it’s poised to do so.

PANTS-FIRE,Harry Reid is way off on claim that 30% of women rely only on Planned Parenthood for health care ,"An anti-abortion group recently released several secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing fetal tissue, and that has given opponents of the abortion-providing health organization new momentum to shut off federal funding.Planned Parenthood ""is the health care backbone for American women during their lives,"" Reid said. ""In fact, it's the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care.""A reader thought that number sounded high and asked us to check it out.We started by doing some basic math.According to the 2013 Census Bureau population estimate, there were about 161 million women in the United States, of whom 131 million were age 15 or over -- the primary constituency for Planned Parenthood. Thirty percent of that number is about 39 million women.Did Planned Parenthood serve 39 million women who had no other health care options? Not even close.Equally problematic, there's no indication in Planned Parenthood’s data that each of the 2.7 million patients had no other health care resources to rely on, as Reid said was the case.Our ruling"
PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump wrongly says the number of illegal immigrants is 30 million or higher,"The day after Donald Trump visited the border in Laredo, Texas, he was armed with some fresh claims about illegal immigration, including how many immigrants are actually here.Host Joe Scarborough then asked Trump, ""Who are you hearing that from?""Trump replied: ""I am hearing it from other people, and I have seen it written in various newspapers. The truth is the government has no idea how many illegals are here.""Is Trump right that there are 30 million or more illegal immigrants? We decided to see what the latest evidence shows.Counting illegal immigrantsAccording to the department’s estimates, the number of illegal immigrants peaked around 12 million in 2007 and has gradually declined to closer to 11 million.All of them arrive at their figures by subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census.All of the researchers we interviewed found similar figures to the federal government and said that Trump’s claim was wildly inflated.""There are, to my knowledge, no credible, research-based estimates of 30 million,"" said Jeffrey Passel, an expert on Hispanic immigration at the Pew Research Center. ""The 11-12 million range is broadly accepted by almost all researchers and immigration advocates (regardless of perspective).""Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the total number of illegal immigrants has essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving has roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status.Could the census be missing enough illegal immigrants in its counts that the estimate is actually in Trump’s range? The experts we talked with said no.""Even though the empirical estimates have a margin of error of maybe plus or minus a million, there is virtually no evidence that the real number could be even a few million higher than 11 million,"" said Robert Warren, a fellow at the Center for Migration Studies and a former demographer with the Census Bureau and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Camarota said that the reason the 30 million figure is unlikely is that the census asks other questions that allow researchers to estimate how good the data is -- for example, the number of births to immigrant mothers, school enrollment and death records, which helps shore up the figure. In other words, if there were three times the generally accepted number of illegal immigrants in the United States, they would show up in those other categories.Marc Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that doesn’t take positions on immigration legislation, said that 30 million ""is a totally absurd number.""""There is NO published report by a serious research organization or academic that suggests anything in the range of 30 million,"" he said.So how did Trump come up with his inflated figure? We aren’t certain, since a campaign spokeswoman declined to comment. But we’ve heard others cite similar figures.The Center for Immigration Studies disagrees with that last point.Our rulingTrump said the number of illegal immigrants in the United States is ""30 million, it could be 34 million.""The Department of Homeland Security says the number of illegal immigrants was about 11.4 million as of January 2012. Other independent groups that research illegal immigration put the number between 11 and 12 million. We found no compelling evidence that the number could as high as Trump said.Trump has provided no proof that the number of illegal immigrants is triple the widespread consensus. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"No, 300,000 slave owners did not fight on the Union side in the Civil War","A common argument in the dispute over official displays of the Confederate battle flag is that most people misunderstand the reasons behind the Civil War. It was not about slavery, these advocates say, but about the right to secede from the Union.Baldwin gave many reasons to back up his conclusion, but a reader asked us to examine one in particular: Slavery was not the pivotal reason for the war because thousands of slave owners supported the North.""Do you not realize that when Lincoln signed his (Emancipation) proclamation, there were over 300,000 slaveholders who were fighting in the Union army?"" Baldwin wrote. ""Check it out.""The first thing we did was reach out to Baldwin to learn his source. We did not hear from him.As we researched this, we found that Baldwin’s statement was vague on one key point -- he didn’t say which states the slaveholders came from. When the war began, slavery was legal in four Union states. Those were Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. West Virginia fell somewhere in between because it split off from Virginia in 1863 to join the Union.So in theory, there were slaveholders from Union states and slaveholders from Confederate states that could have fought on the Union side. That distinction might make no difference to Baldwin’s argument, but it makes a big difference in the underlying math.Keep your states straight""It will be seen that the disloyalty of West Point was not as great as is generally supposed. In the navy about one-third of the officers came from slaveholding States, yet remained faithful to the Union; while one-eighth of the Union army, or 300,000 men, were contributed by the Southern States.""In addition to McPherson, we reached historians Robert Tinkler at California State University-Chico and Gary Gallagher at the University of Virginia. All of them agree on these approximate totals:White Union soldiers from Confederate states -- 75,000-100,000White Union soldiers from slaveholding Union states -- 200,000So, in round figures, it is reasonably accurate to say that 300,000 white men from slaveholding states fought on the Union side. (In addition, as many as 200,000 black former slaves became Union soldiers and sailors.)But there is no reason to believe that all or even a hefty minority of these white soldiers were slave owners themselves. In fact, all three historians we reached told us there was no evidence to back up that assertion and plenty of reasons to suggest it does not fit the facts that are known.Few slaveholding Union soldiersGallagher told us that there is no breakdown of which Union soldiers came from slave-owning families. However, we do know where slavery was common and where it wasn’t, and the Union soldiers in question came from places where it wasn’t.For the men from the Confederate states, Tinkler said the pattern is clear.""These soldiers generally came from low slaveholding areas, such as the mountain regions of Tennessee, and small, non-slaveholding families,"" he said.The upland residents of what became West Virginia fit the same mold. Tinkler said across Appalachia, support for secession was thin at the start of the war and as time went by, resistance increased. The Confederate Congress played a role in that.""In October 1862, Congress amended the Conscription Act with what became known as the ‘Twenty Negro Law,’ a provision that exempted from the draft one white man of military age on plantations with at least 20 slaves,"" Tinkler wrote. ""Designed to help secure plantation districts against slave revolts, this exemption policy inspired much class-based opposition to the Confederacy. ‘A rich man’s war, but a poor man’s fight’ became the cry of many southerners of modest means.""Needless to say, men of modest means were less likely to own slaves.All three historians told us that the number of men on the Union side who owned slaves was quite small.""Very few of them were slaveholders, probably not more than a very few thousand,"" McPherson told us. ""Among those Southern whites who did own slaves, even in the Unionist border slave states, many supported the Confederacy, and fought for it.""Implausible numbersIn 1860, there were about 412,000 men from slaveholding families who could serve as soldiers.We can only take this as a rough guide for several reasons — in the course of the war, young men would be killed, others would come of age, and later in the war, the Confederates broadened the age of conscription to span from 17 to 50 years old. But the general scale shows how Baldwin’s figure stretches belief.Gallagher noted that over the four years of the war, the South put 800,000-900,000 men under arms. It was a mobilization effort that he called ""astonishing.""""That could only be accomplished by putting the vast majority of males from slaveholding families into service,"" Gallagher said.Our rulingBaldwin said that 300,000 slaveholders fought in the Union army. The closest we can get to that figure is an estimate that 300,000 men from states that allowed slavery put on the Union blue uniform. But that provides no evidence that all of them owned slaves, either directly themselves or through their families.The historians we reached said the actual number of slaveholders who fought for the Union was tiny, perhaps a few thousand.The data from the 1860 census show that if Baldwin were correct, an overwhelming fraction of all of the young men from slave-owning families across the Deep South and beyond would needed to have broken with their communities and fought for the Union. Had that happened, it is hard to see how the Confederacy would have been able to fight at all.The chance that a few thousand slaveholders fought for the Union, rather than the 300,000 as Baldwin said, does little to keep this statement in the realm of reality. We rate it Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Did a Vermont pastor get sentenced to prison for refusing to marry a gay couple?,"Is it real? We decided to take a closer look.The article was published at a site called NewsExaminer on July 10. It says that a pastor from Proctor, Vt., was sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. It came just days after the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that same-sex marriage would be allowed in all 50 states. (The ruling didn’t legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont, which approved it on its own in 2009.)The article cites several individuals involved in the case, but none seem to exist.The Hon. Myron Danus, the judge who supposedly made the ruling, is also fictitious. We checked the Vermont Court Administration Office in Montpelier, the U.S. District Court in Rutland County, and the Rutland County District Court to check if there is any judge by that name in the state, and there isn’t.We also couldn’t find a record for the Vermont Family Research Committee or its purported president, Steve Shand.However, the Christian Proctor Church is as fake as its pastor. According to the Proctor Town Offices, the town has only three churches: St. Dominic’s, Union, and St. Paul’s.Our rulingPosts about a Christian pastor in Vermont being sentenced to one year in prison after refusing to marry a gay couple have circulated on the Internet.

PANTS-FIRE,It's a hoax: Jay-Z and Beyonce aren't trying to buy rights to the Confederate flag,"Now, in the latest line of Confederate flag related news, comes another claim from Newswatch33 that has caught the attention of a variety of other media sources.According to Newswatch33, the Carters want to purchase the resell rights to the Confederate flag for close to $280 million. This means that anyone who would want to sell merchandise with the flag’s image would have to request permission from the couple or risk a lawsuit. The article includes a quote by a person identified as the couple’s attorney, Ralph Hammerstein, in connection to the matter.Is there any truth to this?The short answer is no. It’s a well-conceived hoax.Can someone even buy the rights to the Confederate flag?Again, no.About Newswatch33Some of the other articles published by Newswatch33 have already been proven to be bogus.Other claims from the website seem just as ludicrous.Why you can't buy rights to the Confederate flagThere’s no evidence Hammerstein is really the Carters’ attorney, nor any other verifiable account of this story.Even if the quote were accurate -- which it’s not -- getting the rights to the Confederate flag would be a fool’s errand. Not even for $280 million?""No,"" said Christopher Jon Sprigman, a law professor at New York University.""Because the flag was created under the laws of the Confederacy, even if there was a copyright on this, it’s a question of whether it would still be covered (by that copyright),"" Sprigman said.The particular design that we now associate with the Confederacy was actually rejected as the Confederate States of America’s national flag in 1861. Designed by South Carolinian Rep. William Porcher Miles, it was later an unofficial emblem of General Robert E.

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump says Mexican government 'forces many bad people into our country',"""The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart,"" he told interviewer Katy Tur. ""They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn’t believe. They're forcing people into our country. … And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico’s problems.""In the interview, Trump left no doubt that he believes the Mexican government is taking an active role in pushing migrants into the United States: He used the word ""forcing"" four times to describe what the government was doing.But is it really the government forcing Mexicans across the border, rather than individual decisions to leave, either to seek employment or to join family members in the United States?A range of immigration experts told PolitiFact that there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. (The Mexican Embassy did not respond to our inquiries, nor did a Trump representative.)The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey finds Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong.What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact.""Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’ "" Massey said. ""Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border.""Other experts sided with Massey.""Immigrants come to work or to join family,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. ""And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave.""""No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object,"" added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration.""While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups,"" Smith said.But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added.About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is forcing people to leave.It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said.Trump ""does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population,"" Massey said. ""People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate.""In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well.Our rulingTrump said ""the Mexican government forces many bad people into our country."" Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are ""bad"" or not, there is no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"Occupy Democrats group says Wisconsin is 'dead broke' due to actions by Scott Walker, GOP","A Facebook meme posted by a liberal Democratic group puts a new twist on an old claim that the state of Wisconsin is ""broke.""The post by Occupy Democrats includes a photo of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and this statement:""Last year, Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed a $541 million tax cut for millionaires and corporations. Today, Wisconsin’s budget is $283 million in the red, funding for education is being slashed, government programs are being gutted, and the state is about to miss a $108 million debt payment -- because it is dead broke.""Occupy Democrats was founded by Omar Rivero, an unsuccessful 2014 Democratic nominee for the Florida state House. The group frequently posts provocative memes that draw considerable attention. The March 15, 2015 ""dead broke"" post continues to make the rounds and had been shared more than 18,000 times as of July 1, 2015.The group did not respond to an email asking for backup for the claim.The claim Wisconsin is ""broke"" is familiar  -- though in the past we have heard it from the other side of the aisle. Walker and other Republicans have used it to describe the condition of the state’s finances when they took office in 2011.What’s more, the state had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans.So what about the Occupy Democrats claim that various actions by Walker have left the state ""dead broke""?Behind the claimBefore the group gets to its central point, it lays out a list of assertions that amount to its evidence. Some of them -- education being ""slashed"" and government programs ""gutted"" -- are offered without specifics. In the cases where details are provided, the picture is not always so clean.Take the tax cut.At the time the 2014 tax cut was approved, projections showed that the state was on track to have a $1 billion budget surplus in June 2015.Times changed, and so do budget projections.But this deferral strategy is nothing new. It has been employed for years by Walker and previous governors, including his predecessor Democrat Jim Doyle. It’s even got a nickname: ""Scoop and toss"" -- as in scoop up the debt and toss it into the future for others to address.So, while it’s true that Walker skipped a payment, it’s a financing move that’s not unusual, and not an indication of bankruptcy or similar financial calamity.Indeed, the move helped bring the 2013-15 budget into balance.That points us back to the group’s ""dead broke"" claim.But the state is still paying its bills and there has been no indication that it's on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency. Further, under federal law, the state is not allowed to make such a declaration.Said Patrick: ""There is no imbalance and Wisconsin is not ‘dead broke.’ ""Some may find such a statement from Walker’s office ironic. But that does not mean it is inaccurate.Our rating In a Facebook meme, the group Occupy Democrats says Wisconsin is ""dead broke"" because of various actions by Walker and Republicans.Yes, there were tax cuts, and cuts to many programs along the way.

This machine was able to reduce the time it took to separate seeds from the cotton. However, at the same time the increase in the number of plantations willing to move from other crops to cotton meant the greater need for a large amount of cheap labor, i.e. slaves. Thus, the southern economy became a one crop economy, depending on cotton and therefore on slavery.""In fact, most of the causes listed on that page, four out of five, revolved around slavery, including the growth of the abolition movement, the fight over allowing slavery in new states, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, who was seen as anti-slavery.Just in case the Internet led us astray, we also reached out to a pair of experts on the history of the Civil War.They, too, said McInnes got it fundamentally wrong.Indeed, the first sentence refers to slaveholding states, and throughout, the institution of slavery is the pivot point around which all else turns.So just to be clear: Slavery led to secession, which led to the Civil War. Our rulingMcInnes’ Twitter profile shows a man staring intently with eyes crossed, which captures the accuracy of tweet.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chain email says Medicare won't pay for 'observational' stay in hospital due to Obamacare,"A reader recently sent us a chain email we hadn’t seen before. The lengthy missive, purportedly written by a ""senior gentleman in Mesa, Arizona,"" details a visit to a hospital made contentious by Medicare payment rules. The anonymous author claims to have experienced ""a medical situation that made it very clear that the ‘Affordable Care Act’ is neither affordable, nor do they care.""Here’s what happened next:""I said, ‘Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you admit me for observation, my Medicare will not pay anything. This is due to the Affordable Care Act.’ He said, ‘That's right, it won't.’ I then grabbed for my bag of clothing and said, ‘Then I'm going home.’ He said you're really too sick to be going home, but I understand your position. This health program is going to hit seniors especially hard.""Then another doctor came into the room. ""I said, ‘Doc, you and I both know that under the Affordable Care Act anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.’ At which point he nodded in affirmation. I said, ‘You will either admit me for a specific treatment or you won't admit me.’ Realizing he wasn't going to win this one, he said he would prepare my release papers.""We zeroed in on the core claim of this story, that ""under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.""When we looked into it, we found that Medicare does indeed have different reimbursement policies for patients who had been admitted to hospitals for observation as opposed to being admitted to treat a specific diagnosis. However, the email’s author (and, if his recounting is accurate, each of the medical professionals he spoke to) were sorely misinformed about how Medicare rules operate.The different reimbursement rates have to do with follow-up in-home care, not the original hospital stay. And crucially, the controversy over reimbursement for patients under ""observation care"" has nothing whatsoever to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act.What is ‘observation care’?Because observation care is considered outpatient treatment, Medicare generally covers such visits, minus things like copayments and the cost of routine drugs. Where Medicare reimbursement significantly falls short is once an observation patient leaves the hospital.In other words, assuming the email author’s story actually happened, he shouldn’t have had to worry about Medicare paying for his time in the hospital while under observation. Medicare would have paid, minus copayments and the like; there was no need for him to go home while in a fragile state just to avoid being responsible for the full cost of his care.Is this related to the Affordable Care Act?Tying this policy to Obama’s law is flat-out wrong.""The Affordable Care Act has nothing to do with observation status,"" said Mary T. (Terry) Berthelot, a senior attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Several other health-policy experts confirmed that. The policy was established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.While we’re at it, we’ll take a moment to debunk an additional Affordable Care Act-related claim included in the email.The author writes that during a visit to his family practitioner, ""I told him that I had heard that the Affordable Care Act would no longer pay for cancer treatment for those 76 and older, is that true? His understanding is that it is true.""Our rulingThe chain email said that ""under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.""That’s wrong. Medicare will cover the hospital stay, minus standard copayments and the like. Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however.Even more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama’s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason. This claim rates Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Donald Trump gets claim about U.S. GDP doubly wrong,"During his rambling presidential announcement speech, real estate developer and television personality Donald Trump took on many, many targets. One of those was economic growth under President Barack Obama.""The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.""For starters, Trump didn’t even phrase his claim correctly. He said that ""our gross domestic product … was below zero."" Real gross domestic product was in the trillions of dollars -- not anywhere close to zero. He meant growth in GDP. But even phrased appropriately, his claim is wrong. (Trump's staff did not return inquiries from PolitiFact.)The real annualized change in gross domestic product during the first quarter of 2015 was indeed negative -- it fell by 0.7 percent. But ""never below zero""? That’s way off.Negative GDP growth -- in other words, GDP shrinkage -- from quarter to quarter is one of the hallmarks of a recession. And there have been lots of recessions over the years -- 11 since World War II.The first year the government calculated the change in GDP from quarter to quarter was 1947. We looked back and found no fewer than 42 quarters over that period in which GDP shrank on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis. That’s roughly 15 percent of the time.Here’s a summary of how frequently this has happened historically: YearQuarters of negative GDP growth that year19472194931953219541195621957219581195911960219691197021973119743197511980219812198221990119911200122008320092201112014120151We should also note that the poor first quarter of 2015 may not end up as a negative quarter once the final revisions are made. In a couple of weeks, the government will release a final number that takes into account new and complete data, and it’s currently so close to zero that it’s possible it could slip into positive territory.It’s also worth noting that this quarterly figure should be taken with some caution.""This estimate does not suggest a recession,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University. ""We've had a weird pattern in the last few years of weak first quarter estimates."" Some analysts have chalked these up to unusually harsh winters that seasonal adjustments weren’t strong enough to iron out. The general rule of thumb is that it takes two quarters of negative growth to signal a recession.Finally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we’ll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents.Our rulingTrump said that in ""the last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero."" He messes up his economic terms; the gross domestic product was not ""zero."" And the growth in the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years. That’s a lot more than ""never."" We rate his claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Rick Scott says we have 'record funding' for the environment in Florida,"Gov. Rick Scott says that Florida has invested big bucks in the environment.As he boasted about the state’s record during his economic summit for GOP presidential contenders in Orlando June 2, Scott reeled off a bunch of statistics about Florida’s budget and economy including this one: ""If you care about the environment, we've got record funding.""But despite that record, does Florida now have ""record funding"" for the environment? No, it doesn’t.Everglades and springs fundingScott’s spokesman pointed us to his proposals to increase funding for springs restoration and for preserving the Everglades.As for the Everglades, the state reached an agreement in 2012 with the federal government to end a dispute that predates Scott. Over 13 years, the state will spend $880 million on Everglades cleanup, or about $32 million a year.In 2014 the Legislature increased Everglades restoration funding to $169 million, more than double the previous year’s total. The Legislature also earmarked $90 million for raising 2.6 miles of the Tamiami Trail to let the Everglades flow more freely beneath it. That brought the total amount during that session to $259 million.""The one place where he did step up was on the Everglades,"" said Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida. ""It was the environmental highlight of his term as governor.""But where Scott has fallen short on the Everglades is acquiring U.S. Sugar land south of Lake Okeechobee, Jackalone said. A deal in the works for the state to buy about 46,000 acres fell apart earlier this year.Department of Environmental ProtectionWhile Everglades and springs restoration are important parts of environmental funding, they don’t provide a complete picture.If we look back a decade at funding for the Department of Environmental Protection, the high point was $2.9 billion in 2006-07 under then Gov. Jeb Bush. DEP is tasked with protecting air, water and land. Under Scott, DEP’s budget peaked at $1.8 billion in 2011-12.In 2006-07, the state used an extra $310 million (on top of Florida Forever’s usual $300 million land-buying program) to purchase Babcock Ranch, 73,000 acres of cypress domes and pine forests in Charlotte and Lee counties.DEP’s budget was also in the $2 billion range part of the time under the next governor, Charlie Crist. But once the recession kicked in, DEP’s budget decreased.What Scott omitsThere have been several other cuts related to the environment under Scott:But environmentalists say he doesn’t hold a record for overall environmental funding.""He cut back services to DEP, he cut back funding to various water management districts in state, he hasn’t done what needs to be done to acquire sugar land south of Okeechobee to finish Everglades restoration,"" Jackalone said. Also, ""he cut back on environmental enforcement.""Our rulingScott said, ""If you care about the environment, we've got record funding.""Scott's team points to investments the state has made to restore the Everglades and springs during Scott’s tenure -- and he has championed both.While those are high-profile projects, he claimed that Florida has ""record funding"" for the environment overall, and that’s not the case. The budget for the state Department of Environmental Protection and for Florida Forever were not a record under Scott -- two major pots of money that relate to the environment.Scott repeated a previously debunked claim in a national forum; his statement has long been proved incorrect. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,West Texas sheriff says U.S. only nation not to use military to secure 'our border',"A Texas sheriff was emphatic about the United States being alone on the planet in relying on non-military agencies to patrol its borders.Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter also was incorrect, we found.Our eyes clamped on what Painter said next: ""We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border. We’re not serious about it.""By phone, Painter told us the United States is one of the few nations in the world not using the military to secure the border. He said he based his declaration on news reports showing military forces on the borders of other countries. ""All you’ve got to do is look at the news on TV,"" Painter said. ""You see it."" He said he didn’t remember which countries he saw on those news reports.Experts say not soIn contrast, experts we consulted called the Texan’s statement a substantial exaggeration.Wilson said numerous countries similarly rely on military forces to pitch in near international borders in part because some border zones are isolated and other agencies don’t have the manpower. He offered as examples of strong military presences Guatemala and Brazil.U.S. Homeland SecurityFor our part, we checked on how the United States regulates border security, then peeked at how Canada does so. In both instances, the military has not been the primary agency handling border safety.By email, Wilson said civilian law enforcement agencies handle U.S. border security. Still, he said, ""we have securitized border management, rolling customs and immigration functions into agencies that have law enforcement and national security at the heart of their mission.""Since the 1980s, the report said, U.S. forces including the National Guard, as authorized by Congress, have conducted a wide variety of counterdrug support missions along the borders of the United States."" The Defense Department’s ""support role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts appears to have increased the department’s profile in border security,"" the report said. Also, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each authorized National Guard troops to help watch the border with Mexico, the report said.CanadaWe spotted no mention of Canada’s armed forces being involved in border security. They’re not, academic experts told us. Burkhart, who helps direct Boise State’s Canadian Studies program, said by email the Canada Border Services Agency handles such duties with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in concert with the U.S. Coast Guard under the joint law enforcement ""Shiprider"" maritime security program in the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. ""The Canadian Forces, the name for the Canadian military, does not participate in border enforcement,"" Burkhart said.Other nationsJanda followed up by email, calling the sheriff’s statement ""demonstrably false. Most countries in the world use national law enforcement to police their borders just like we do."" He added: ""The only countries that rely on their military to police/defend their borders are nations facing severe instability involving lawlessness and/or refugees in neighboring countries and/or open warfare.""Our rulingPainter said the U.S. stands alone in the world in not using the military to secure ""our border.""We didn’t have to go far to prove Painter wrong. Canada is one of many countries that rely on federal patrols, not the military, to handle border oversight, just as the United States does. The sheriff might’ve seen some border-guarder troops in war-torn lands in TV news reports, but that’s not factual basis for this claim.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, Iraq veteran wasn't runnerup to Caitlyn Jenner for ESPN courage award","""Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but The ESPYS are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,"" said ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt. ""She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.""That didn’t sit well with many people, who thought there were more deserving winners.A Facebook meme, meanwhile, said the runnerup was an Iraq war veteran who lost his arm and leg defending the United States.

""The runner-up was this guy: Army veteran Noah Galloway, who lost an arm and leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq, and now competes in Crossfit events, runs marathons and competed in the 58-hour Death Race.""But the idea that Galloway was runnerup to Jenner is bunk.ESPN put out a follow-up statement on the Arthur Ashe Courage Award two days after announcing Jenner as the recipient. It reads:""The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is meant to honor individuals whose contributions transcend sports through courageous action.

PANTS-FIRE,Ann Coulter wrongly claims that U.S. 'has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population',"Coulter said there is ""absolutely no question"" that the number is at least 30 million. She said the work of two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and a 2006 analysis by two Bear Stearns financial analysts supported her belief. We’ll touch on those items in a bit.Coulter’s mathCoulter zeros in on Mexico to undercut the argument that immigration promotes diversity. ""Diversity in immigration ought to mean every country on earth sends the same percentage of immigrants,"" she writes. In contrast, Mexico provides about a third of all immigrants, and that became her target.Coulter argues that since Mexico has about 120 million people, and one-quarter of that is 30 million, therefore, America has ""taken in"" one-quarter of the total.Misreading the dataWhy does that make such a difference?Well, about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States. By definition, they were never part of Mexico’s population.If they weren’t Mexican, they could not be ""taken in.""One could argue that if the parents hadn’t moved to the United States, the children wouldn’t have been born here. But Coulter offers no analysis and no data on that front. In her framework, a person whose family came from Mexico 70 years ago is just as much a Mexican as someone who arrived yesterday.According to the Census Bureau, about 10.5 million people of Mexican heritage come from families in which both parents were born in the United States. This group is at least second-generation American born.The Pew report found that about 11.6 million people of the 33.5 million total had been born in Mexico, including both authorized and unauthorized immigrants.Estimating the undocumentedTangentially related to this fact-check is Coulter’s suggestion that groups are severely undercounting the number of unauthorized illegal immigrants based on census data.The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration much as Coulter does, disagrees with that last point.""For illegals, we estimate 11 to 12 million with 50 to 60 percent from Mexico,"" said Steven Camarota, the center’s director of research.Jennifer Van Hook, who directs the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, said she believes the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living in the United States is 6.3 million-8.3 million. No matter how you slice it, Coulter’s claim doesn’t get any closer to true, she said.""There is no way it is as high as 30 million,"" Van Hook said.The Migration Policy Institute estimates the total unauthorized population at 11 million. Director of research for American programs Randy Capps said figures produced by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey are just the starting point in determining that figure (the Census Bureau itself doesn't create a count). The final estimate reflects a hike of ""20 to 25 percent to address the undercount of unauthorized immigrants in the ACS.""Capps emphasized that his group, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center and the Center for Immigration Studies generally reach the same results because they all tweak the census data.""All four of these sources incorporate an undercount of unauthorized immigrants ranging from 10 to 25 percent,"" Capps said.Capp’s counterpart at the Pew Research Center, Jeffrey Passel, rejected Coulter’s claim on both methodological and common sense grounds.""It is simply not possible for there to be in excess of 30 million Mexican immigrants in the United States,"" Passel said. ""There are not enough houses available in the country for the 20 or so million more additional Mexicans. Moreover, the Mexican censuses, and surveys are completely inconsistent with such figures.""Our rulingCoulter said that America has taken in one-quarter of the entire population of Mexico. Coulter based this on a study that counted all people of Mexican origin in the United States.But Coulter ignored that 65 percent of those were born in America and about a third came from families in which both parents were born in America. Their immigrant status lay at least two-generations in the past, and America couldn’t ""take them in"" because they were already here.We rate this claim Pants on Fire.Note: This claim was fact-checked as one of the donor-benefits tied to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

PANTS-FIRE,Fireworks lobbyist says sparkler legalization cut Conn. fireworks injury rate by 57 percent in 2000,"One proposal before the General Assembly would restore the state's ban on all fireworks, a prohibition that was in place until the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri lifted it in June 2010.The ban was eased to allow sparklers, spinners and smokers to be purchased in stores. Fireworks that explode or fly through the air remained illegal, although you wouldn't know it during the weeks surrounding that Fourth of July, when the number of neighborhood fireworks displays seems to have, well, skyrocketed since sparklers became legal.Turner argued against the Rhode Island bill, saying the experience in Connecticut, which began allowing sparklers and other ""consumer"" devices, shows the public is actually safer when such products are legal.""When the public is permitted to use sparkling devices as allowed in Rhode Island, they're less apt to go after illegal products,"" Turner told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""Injuries actually go down because more people use a regulated product.""""I'll give you an example,"" he said. ""In 2000, Connecticut, your neighbor, passed a very similar law -- handheld and ground-based sparklers. The Connecticut Department of Public Safety showed a 57-percent decrease in fireworks-related injuries in 2000 compared to the 14 years prior.""We made repeated attempts to contact Turner to find the source of his information. He never returned our phone messages or emails.So we tried to get the data ourselves.Turner cited the state's department of public safety. So we went there. After one month, the only data it could provide was well outside the period Turner mentioned in his testimony. And the numbers it did have -- one or two injuries per year reported to the department's Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit -- were ridiculously small.Instead of just one injury per year in 2010 to 2014 as logged by the public safety department, the hospital data show an average of 35 people admitted to emergency rooms each year during that period.The number in 2000: 40.Basically there was no change in 2000 versus the average of the previous four years. That's a far cry from a 57-percent drop the year that sparklers were legalized, as Turner insisted, referring to a longer period for which we can’t find -- and he hasn’t provided -- any reliable data.The average since 2000: 43 emergency room injuries per year, which is actually a slight increase from the year when Connecticut legalized sparklers.We tried to add in the much smaller numbers for people whose injuries were serious enough to require hospitalization, using inpatient discharge data going back to 1991, the oldest available. But the state would not give us firm numbers for the years when inpatient discharges were 5 or fewer.But even when we assumed numbers most favorable to Turner, the reduction in 2000 wasn't even close.And if you look at subsequent years, the number of injuries have, on average, increased.Our rulingFireworks lobbyist Eric Turner, contending that fireworks injuries decreased when sparklers are legalized, said that when Connecticut legalized sparklers and similar pyrotechnics in 2000, there was ""a 57-percent decrease . . . . compared to the 14 years prior.""While Turner stood up and shot off his mouth on Smith Hill, he wouldn’t respond to our repeated requests for information. And when we contacted the agency he cited in his testimony, we found the current database misses virtually all fireworks injuries.Finally, the most reliable source of information -- hospital records collected by the state health department -- shows no significant change in emergency room visits before and after sparklers and similar devices became legal."

His campaign said the answer was pretty simple: a red eye flight.Feingold took United Airlines flight 995 from San Francisco to Chicago. The flight left at about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday and arrived in Chicago at about 5:44 a.m. Thursday morning, said Russ for Wisconsin campaign manager Tom Russell.Feingold was picked up at the airport and back in the Badger State when his latest quest began, his campaign said.Our ratingThe National Republican Senatorial Committee said that Russ Feingold announced his campaign for Senate while in California.But tweets and other evidence shows he was in Wisconsin at the time.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Was Ronald Reagan's record on black unemployment better than Barack Obama's?,"Recently, a reader forwarded us a social media meme that accused President Barack Obama of having a worse record on African-American employment than former President Ronald Reagan -- a charge which, if true, would be an embarrassment to the nation’s first black president.The meme says: ""During Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent."" This text has been placed over a photograph of an African-American man wearing a T-shirt that reads, ""I need a job.""Is the meme correct? We took a closer look.We’ll start by noting that on its face, the comparison is odd. It compares Reagan’s full eight-year term to five years under Obama (not even the full six-plus years that Obama has been in office so far). Doing so is problematic because it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. In addition, the meme glosses over the question of how much impact a president has on unemployment among any racial or ethnic group. Their policies are generally considered to have some impact, but joblessness is also affected by factors beyond a president’s control, such as technological change and international economic competition.That said, the meme also has problems with the data. We’ll start by looking at the parameters the meme used, even though they are of questionable value.During Reagan’s full term -- January 1981 to January 1989 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent. That’s a decline of 2.8 percentage points, or 19 percent. That’s close to what the meme said.But during Obama’s first five years -- January 2009 to January 2014 -- black unemployment didn’t rise at all, which is what the meme said. Rather, it fell from 12.7 percent to 12.1 -- a decline of 0.6 percentage points, or about 5 percent. The meme’s claim of a 42 percent increase is way off.Now let’s look at the first five years of each presidency -- a more reasonable comparison to make.During Reagan’s first five years -- January 1981 to January 1986 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 14.5 percent. That’s a decline of 0.1 percentage point, or less than a 1 percent decrease. This is a lot less impressive than the meme’s favored eight-year decline of 20 percent. It’s also less impressive than the 5 percent decline during Obama’s first five years.If we instead look at Obama’s entire term to date -- January 2009 to April 2015 -- black unemployment fell from 12.7 percent to 9.6 percent. That’s down 3.1 percentage points, or a decrease of 24 percent. That’s a more impressive decline than under Reagan’s entire term.There are also other ways to compare the two presidents’ records on black unemployment.• The black unemployment rate peaked at 21.2 percent under Reagan in January 1983, but the peak under Obama was significantly lower -- 16.8 percent in March 2010.• The low point for black unemployment under Reagan was 11 percent, reached twice in 1988. The low point under Obama is 9.6 percent, which is the current rate. That’s lower than the lowest point under Reagan.• Under Reagan, black unemployment exceeded its worst level under Obama -- 16.8 percent -- for 26 consecutive months, or more than two years straight.Our rulingThe meme says that ""during Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent.""This claim is problematic on several levels. It presents a time frame cherry-picked to boost Reagan’s record. It flat-out misrepresents the statistics during Obama’s first five years, when black unemployment actually fell. And it ignores several other measures that show that black unemployment was better in absolute terms under Obama than Reagan. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Garnet Coleman said transgender individuals have a 1 in 12 chance of getting murdered,"State Rep. Garnet Coleman brought up murder in urging colleagues to add acts against transgender Texans to the state’s hate-crimes law. ""The facts do not lie,"" the Houston Democrat said in a May 6, 2015, hearing held by the Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence.Coleman, suggesting transgender Americans are more likely to be attacked, went on: ""Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1-in-12 chance of being murdered. The average person has a 1-in-18,000 chance.""By phone, Coleman said: ""The information is false; it’s not verifiable.""We took our own look.Chances of a murderWe recognized, for starters, that counting the number of murders across the population isn’t the same as calculating the chances of any member of a subgroup getting murdered. Various factors come into play including where someone lives and works, for instance.Other researchOverall, the report said, anti-LGBTQ and HIV-affected homicides in 2013 were down 28 percent from the year before, totaling 18 compared with 25 in 2012. But for the third year in a row, the report said, ""transgender, transgender people of color, and LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color experienced disproportionately severe violence."" Thirteen of the 2013 victims were transgender women, the report said.The report also said: ""Unfortunately, data on the prevalence of hate violence against queer, bisexual, transgender and HIV-affected people is virtually non-existent."" Also disconcerting, the report said, its 2013 report documented over 600 more survivors and victims of hate violence through 2012 than the FBI had (1,376 survivors and victims compared to 2,001 survivors and victims).We also reached Vincent Villano, spokesman for the National Center for Transgender Equality. By phone, Villano expressed unfamiliarity with the 1-in-12 figure. ""There really isn’t any data available out there,"" Villano said.Our rulingColeman told colleagues: ""Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1 in 12 chance of being murdered.""We’re not judging here whether transgender individuals are at risk of attack. But we did not find evidence for this figure or even sufficient information to gauge if it was rooted in facts. All told, Coleman's claim was both unsupported and implausible.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"No, the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight didn't generate more revenue than the GDP of 29 countries","But did revenue from the boxing match at the MGM Grand Arena Saturday night surpass the Gross Domestic Products of nearly 30 countries? That was the claim made a couple of times during the HBO/Showtime pay-per-view broadcast.Ticket sales topped $74 million (more than the Super Bowl), organizers said, and another 3 million people were expected to fork over $100 to watch the fight at home. Add in other sources of revenue and Saturday’s event was projected to generate an estimated $400 million.That’s ""larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries,"" HBO boxing sportscaster Jim Lampley said during the live broadcast.We’re not sure where Lampley and event organizers got their information from -- we weren’t able to get in touch with him or someone from HBO -- but that figure is way off, according to the World Bank, which tracks global financial data for about 200 countries and territories.All six are tiny island nations. Here are their 2013 GDPs:Micronesia: $316 millionSao Tome and Principe: $311 millionPalau: $247 millionMarshall Islands: $191 millionKiribati: $169 millionTuvalu: $38 millionThe country with the seventh-lowest GDP is Tonga, with a GDP of $466 million, just surpassing the estimated revenue of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. For comparison, the United States had the world’s largest GDP in 2013 -- $16.8 trillion.We think one explanation for the large discrepancy with Lampley’s claim is the fact that the World Bank doesn’t have GDP data for 22 economies.But of the missing 22, most are territories of other nations -- for example the United States territory of Guam or the British territory of the Cayman Islands. Only six without a 2013 World Bank GDP are fully independent nations: Andorra, North Korea, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria.We looked up the most recent GDP estimates we could find for each country to see if any were less than $400 million, but we found that all six exceeded that amount:Andorra: $3.7 billion (2008 -- World Bank)North Korea: $28 billion (2009 -- CIA World Factbook)Liechtenstein: $4.8 billion (2009 -- World Bank)Myanmar: $64.3 billion (2014 -- CIA World Factbook)Somalia: $2.4 billion (2010 -- CIA World Factbook)Syria: $40.4 billion (2007 -- World Bank)So in total, only six countries have GDPs smaller than the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.Our rulingLampley said the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was ""larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries.""The match was estimated to generate about $400 million, which is a lot of money, to be sure. But only six out of the world’s nearly 200 countries have GDPs smaller than that, according to World Bank data.We’re KO’ing this claim.

Krav Maga does have a strong connection with Israel. It was developed by the Israeli Defense Force in the earliest years of the country’s existence. It emphasizes quick and debilitating counter attacks in one-on-one combat.Krav Maga combines elements of wrestling, boxing and jiu-jitsu.

Here’s a portion of the article:""In a closed-door session with shareholders on Tuesday, Facebook executives wheeled out a set of new rules which, when implemented later this year, will ban their users from creating status updates and image posts related in any way to religion, while also vowing to disband groups and take down pages with religious goals or affiliations.""The story goes on to claim that Facebook will implement the new rules in three phases by removing pages with religious themes; prohibiting the posting or sharing of religious images and memes; and implementing filters to weed out status updates that include words like ""Jesus,"" ""prayer,"" ""church,"" or ""God.""This would be a pretty big deal if it were true, but there’s a problem: The National Report is a fake news site.Our rulingA recent article claims that Facebook plans to institute a ban on all user-generated posts related to religion. However, the article comes from the National Report, a satirical website. It is not factual and was never intended to be. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Meme on Facebook says Ted Cruz declared 'no place' for gays, atheists in 'my America'","Here we go again: A reader just pointed out a Facebook meme suggesting Texan Ted Cruz declared America constitutionally off limits to gays and atheists last month when he declared his candidacy for president.Did not happen.The ‘no place’ Facebook postNow let’s turn to the Facebook post brought to our attention most recently:The afternoon we scrolled the page, we didn’t spot the Cruz meme. But the image and purported Cruz statement had been sent out by the group in this March 25, 2015, tweet:No confirmation in news storiesThe image did not put the statement in quotation marks. Still, the meme as a whole struck us as leaving the impression that Cruz said it.And it doesn’t look like he did. In fact, online searches and a check of the Nexis news database yielded no evidence Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has ever made a comment about the Constitution leaving no place for gays or atheists in his America. To our inquiry about the presented quotation, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email it’s ""obviously false.""Cruz’s speech declaring for presidentIn the speech, Cruz mentioned marriage once, gays and atheists not at all.On marriage, he said: ""Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage.""Cruz didn’t mention atheists, but he emphasized religious faith before students at the university founded by the late Jerry Falwell, an evangelist. For instance, Cruz referred to ""the God-given liberty of every American."" He also said: ""God’s blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn’t done with America yet.""He closed:""I am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children and our children’s children. We stand together for liberty.""This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington. It will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution.""It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America.""Other Cruz commentsFinally, we looked into whether the meme’s quotations reflected on past Cruz comments.Cruz also has stressed his religious faith; he’s a Baptist, Tyler told us.Our rulingA Facebook post suggests Cruz said the day he declared for president, ""There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear.""Cruz has been clear about his belief in God and opposition to legalizing gay marriages. However, there is no record of him saying the Constitution leaves no place for gays or atheists in ""my America.""Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,George Will repeats debunked claim that Ronald Reagan created 1 million jobs in 1 month,"Will is correct that across President Reagan’s two terms, there were 23 months when the economy added over 300,000 jobs (the average monthly gain once the recovery took hold in March 1983 was about 250,000 jobs).We emailed Will and his assistant and did not hear back by the time we published, but there can be only one month that Will had in mind. It is September 1983.Put simply, the strike jangled the monthly job counts on both ends. It drove down the tally for August and pumped it up in September (and drove it back down for October). This graph using government data shows what happened:The government’s September 1983 jobs report explicitly tied the 1.1 million spike to the labor dispute.""Nonagricultural payroll employment rose by 735,000 in September,"" the report said. ""About 675,000 of this increase, however, represented the return of employees to payrolls following settlement of strikes, chiefly that of communications workers.""Our rulingWill said Reagan created 1 million jobs in one month.Will should have, too.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chain email: Secret Service pays the Clintons' mortgage,"Now that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is nearing the launch of her 2016 presidential campaign, old rumors are starting to resurface.The email reads, in part:Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a New York State Senator now comes under this fancy ""congressional retirement staffing plan"" which means that if she never gets re-elected, she STILL receives her Congressional salary until she dies. If Bill out-lives her, he then inherits HER salary until he dies. He is already getting his Presidential salary ($20,000 a month) until he dies. If Hillary out-lives Bill, she also gets HIS salary until she dies, Guess who pays for that?WE DO! Clinton's 20 Acre - $11 million mansion is common knowledge. For her to establish NY residency, they purchased this mansion in upscale Chappaqua, New York....makes sense. They are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. Still makes sense. Here is where it becomes interesting. Their mortgage payments are around $10,000/month. But an extra residence had to be built by the government on the acreage to house the Secret Service Agents. Any improvement to the property is owned by the property owners...the Clinton's. So....the Clinton's charge the federal government $10,000 monthly rent for the use of the extra residence to house the Secret Service staff which is just about equal to their mortgage payment.There’s a lot to unravel here. Is any of it true? Short answer: No.PensionsHowever, the pension for a member of Congress must not exceed 80 percent of the member’s final salary, according to law. So even if she received the highest pension possible, she wouldn’t be getting her full salary. In fact, in Clinton’s case, it would be much lower.Taxpayer-funded mortgage?When we looked at this in 2007, Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said, ""They have not and do not receive money"" from the Secret Service.This time around, we asked current spokesman Nick Merrill, who said, ""this is the same as it used to be, nothing has changed since last time you reported this.""Even if the Clintons got the $1,100 rent from the Secret Service, it would not have covered the size of their monthly mortgage.Our rulingA chain email said Hillary Clinton will receive her ""congressional salary until she dies"" and that the Secret Service pays her mortgage.Actually, a pension for a member of Congress cannot exceed 80 percent of the member’s last salary, according to law. Using federal employee retirement system formulas, Clinton’s retirement pension would likely work out to be about 25 percent of her congressional salary, about $41,000 a year.And while the Clintons are eligible to receive rent payments from the Secret Service -- who need space to operate at the Clintons’ house -- the rent amount would not have covered their mortgage payments. In any case, the Clintons do not accept these rent payments.We rate these claims Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Facebook meme says Ted Cruz a flip-flopper on president needing to be U.S.-born,"Canadian-born Ted Cruz, the Texas senator lately embarked on a bid for president, conveniently flip-flopped on whether a candidate needs to be born in the United States to run for president, an online meme suggests.We speak of this March 26, 2015, Facebook post:The post quotes the pictured Cruz, who was born in Calgary, Alberta, in December 1970 to an American mother and a Cuban-born father, saying Barack ""Obama’s mother’s citizenship is irrelevant since his father wasn’t American and he wasn’t born in America. He can’t be president.""Constitutional provisionThat comment would have been of a piece with inaccurate ""birther"" charges about the Democratic president, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in August 1961 to an American mother and Kenyan father.At issue is the constitutional provision requiring any president to be a ""natural born citizen"" of the United States--meaning the person must be a citizen at birth, most legal experts concur. The candidate also must be 35 years of age and a U.S. resident for 14 years.Cruz flip-flop?The Facebook post, making the case for Cruz’s flip-flop, says Cruz said March 23, 2015, the day he announced his presidential candidacy: ""All you need to know about my parentage is my mother was a citizen. My father and place of birth are irrelevant.""Hypocrite!No confirmation of either commentWe asked Cruz’s campaign if Cruz had ever said Obama couldn’t be president for anything connected to his birthplace. He ""has not,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed.Previously, Gillman took note of a Mother Jones magazine article stating Cruz’s father, Dallas-area pastor Rafael Cruz, had made a comment while stumping for his son that suggested Obama be sent back to Kenya.""We have our work cut out for us,"" the elder Cruz told a North Texas Tea Party gathering Sept. 12, 2012, as later revealed by Mother Jones. ""We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I'd like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.""Our rulingA Facebook meme indicates Ted Cruz has conveniently flip-flopped on whether the president must be U.S.-born.We found no evidence Cruz made the presented comments or that he’s changed his position about the ""natural born citizen"" provision.

PANTS-FIRE,"Has PolitiFact rated Scott Walker the nation's ""most factually-challenged"" politician?","Since we’re in the fact-checking business, we wondered what the party was using as its source.Turns out it's us.RatingsPresident Barack Obama topped the list, with 500 fact checks. Coming in ninth, with 85 fact checks, was Walker -- just behind Hillary Clinton and ahead of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.The Democratic Party said that, based on the tallies, 54 percent of the 85 Walker statements had been rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire -- and that that percentage was higher than anyone else on the top 10 list.OK. But there are several problems with using our ratings to make the claim the party did.The first is obvious. The Democrats based their claim on only the top 10 list, which -- as one might expect -- was dominated by politicians who ran for president or were from states that had PolitiFact operations.  More importantly, we don't rate politicians in the way the Democratic Party's claim suggests. We don’t rate every single claim a person makes. Rather, we choose a statement based largely on whether it is interesting and timely, and we give it a rating based on our research and reporting.And those ratings apply to the individual statements. We don't make sweeping generalizations about a politician's overall facility with the facts.Some notes before we close.Our ratingThe state Democratic Party said Walker ""has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician.""But the party misuses our data to claim we said something we never did.For a statement that is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim, our rating is Pants on Fire. ------More on Scott Walker"
PANTS-FIRE,"Patrick Murphy voted for free lifetime health care for Congress, GOP group says","Murphy, 31, has built a reputation as a middle-of-the-road Democrat, but he could face a challenge on the left from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando. If Rubio runs for president, Murphy is still certain to face a heavyweight on the GOP side -- potentially Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera or CFO Jeff Atwater. Murphy has said he will run whether Rubio runs or not.Did Murphy vote for permanent health care for members of Congress, including himself? Actually, no. Members of Congress do not get health care for life, and Murphy has never voted to give them health care for life.Instead, the NRSC is twisting generic votes in favor of the health care law into an entirely new -- and false -- attack.Murphy and the Affordable Care ActMurphy won his first race for Congress against Allen West in 2012, so he wasn’t in office when Congress approved the Affordable Care Act in 2010.On the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms, which was later repealed.While in office, he has taken votes related to the health care law -- for example, he joined most Democrats in opposing a bill which would have prevented the IRS from enforcing any portion of Obamacare.So what would repeal have to do with members of Congress getting their own insurance?The health care law requires members of Congress to obtain health insurance through an online marketplace, such as healthcare.gov. Previously, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government. If Congress ever repealed Obamacare, members would go back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program.But here’s the problem with the claim: Members of Congress don’t get to use the federal health plan forever. Instead, it’s similar to getting insurance through work. When they lose the election -- essentially losing their job -- they have to find a new way to get health insurance.Included along with the resolution is a ""policy statement on responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars"" that states: ""Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.""By voting against the resolution, ""Patrick Murphy voted to allow Members of Congress to receive taxpayer funded healthcare for life,"" NRSC spokesman Matt Connelly told PolitiFact Florida.But unlike the earlier vote, this one has an added wrinkle in that it carried no power.Both Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense and Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute, said that the House budget resolution doesn’t have the weight of law and it doesn’t go to the president for signature.Murphy’s spokesman Richard Carbo told PolitiFact Florida that ""essentially, the so-called 'ban' is nothing more than words on a page.""""It was a bogus and misleading claim then, and it is a bogus and misleading claim now,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""Obamacare actually gives all Americans the opportunity to obtain what members of Congress already have: access to decent, affordable health insurance.""Our rulingThe NRSC said that Murphy ""voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life.""The NRSC cites votes Murphy took against repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Even if those votes led to actual repeal -- which they didn’t -- members of Congress would not get free healthcare for life.This was a misleading claim when Democrats tried their versions of it in the past -- and it’s just as misleading now.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Koch-backed group says Georgia solar policies cost more,"A group backed by the Koch brothers is arguing a proposed constitutional amendment that would change Florida solar energy regulations will lead the Sunshine State down a dark path.The proposal needs nearly 700,000 signatures to get on the 2016 ballot, allowing voters to decide on an amendment that would change current Florida law that says customers can only buy electricity from a utility. If the amendment is approved, customers could buy electricity from solar installers and not just utility companies. We’ve written about it before here.Is it true that energy regulations in Georgia -- often cited as a leader in implementing new solar policies -- have made electric rates go up? Time to rate the rates.Electric moveIt turns out we’ll be taking a quick look at Louisiana, too, because that’s the state AFP meant to name when citing net metering. They apologized and said they would correct the release, thanking PolitiFact for pointing out the error. We’ll be discussing both states for this check.What is net metering, anyway? In simplest terms, it’s the process of selling self-generated electricity, such as the power made by solar panels on your house, back to a utility company for a credit. The proposed Florida amendment doesn’t really concern itself with that, but rather removes a roadblock to buying power from someone other than a registered electric provider, like Duke Energy or Florida Power & Light. Right now, if a solar provider wants to sell its power, it must sell it to one of these utilities.Critics say being able to end this monopoly is key to expanding solar efforts in Florida, which is ranked 13th in solar installations by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Florida also is one of five states that specifically outlaw buying solar power directly from a provider. The others are Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Georgia.While Georgia isn’t trying to open the market the same way the Florida amendment would, the Peach State is enjoying its own moment in the sunshine on the subject of solar.The state in 2008 offered homeowner tax credits to boost solar installations, a program that expired in 2014.The Georgia Public Service Commission worked with the state’s largest utility, Georgia Power, to create the Georgia Power Advanced Solar Initiative in 2012.The utility created programs to let businesses and homeowners sell solar energy to Georgia Power, as well as working out power-purchase agreements with big solar developers. The plan has been called a success by advocates, the state’s PSC and electric providers, and plans for expanding the amount of solar power in the state are in the works.Georgia Power has said there has been no ""upward pressure on consumer rates."" Spokesman John Kraft told PolitiFact Florida that from the beginning, part of the initiative was that the company would be able to buy solar-generated electricity at or below rates it would cost the company for traditional means, such as electricity generated by burning fossil fuels or using nuclear power. The program was voluntary from the beginning and not a state mandate.The study became controversial because the study’s author -- consultant and Louisiana State University energy studies professor David Dismukes -- had written favorably about the oil and gas industries before. Solar advocates called the report biased for not focusing on the jobs the industry had created and misrepresenting how the state’s tax credits work.Last year, Louisiana voted to end its 50 percent tax credit for solar installations in 2017. Gov. Bobby Jindal is considering cutting it sooner to fill a $1.6 billion budget gap this year.So while Louisiana did see a rate increase, we don’t see evidence that it was specifically related to a solar initiative.Our rulingAmericans for Prosperity Florida said recent solar energy policies in Georgia ""have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable.""The group admitted it meant to say Louisiana, which is having its own debate on the issue. But the program in Georgia is thriving. Part of Georgia's implementation plan was that using solar power wouldn’t affect rates, and it hasn’t, Georgia’s largest utility said. Louisiana did see a rate increase, but it doesn't seem to be specifically related to a solar initiative.The statement is completely wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Creflo Dollar’s need for $65 million jet never gets off the ground,"Pastor Creflo Dollar’s plan to travel the world in the fastest and most luxurious business jet ever built never got off the ground.He and other leaders at World Changers Church International in College Park launched Project G650 with the goal of raising nearly $65 million for the airplane, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful.But negative public reaction to Dollar’s fundraising plea was so swift that it was halted within days of its launch. A promotional video featuring Dollar was quickly pulled down, but lives via YouTube.Some of the harshest words came from the faith community, including contemporary gospel’s Kirk Franklin who said: ""When I camouflage my ‘greeds’ to look like ‘needs,’ that’s a shortage of character."" Others asked: Why couldn’t pastor and evangelist Dollar conduct his mission travels as most do, via commercial airline, rather than a Gulfstream G650?In an article that appeared March 13, Engelmayer told The Christian Post that Dollar is now taking commercial flights when he visits churches in New York.But, ""it’s not that simple,"" Engelmayer said, when a ministry team of 10 to 15 people ""take thousands of pounds,"" even 100,000 pounds, ""of food and provisions with them when they go around the world.""That’s why the Gulfstream G650 is needed, he suggested. ""The plane is not so Creflo Dollar can get on by himself and fly.""Engelmayer made similar comments to the Associated Press. He said members of the ministry travel much of the year bringing their message, food and supplies to people around the world, and this jet has the fuel efficiency, speed, cargo space and seating the church needed.So is that a reason the ministry wanted donations of $65 million -- to have an airplane with cargo space capable of carrying thousands, possibly 100,00 pounds of food and other supplies?PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts.First a little background about the 53-year-old megachurch pastor and evangelist and how he came to say he was praying for a Gulfstream G650.Dollar preaches what is known as the prosperity gospel, a religious doctrine that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. A native of College Park, he founded the non-denominational World Changers Church International, which boasts 30,000 members, 350 employees, an 81-acre campus and mission work on six continents.Dollar has long been criticized for being a preacher who lives a lavish lifestyle with Rolls Royces, million-dollar homes and jets. The tax exempt status of his ministry -- as well as five others -- was the focus of a U.S. Senate committee’s three-plus year investigation that started in 2007 and was based on public complaints and media reports about large salaries, lavish expenditures. Dollar protested the investigation, which closed with no findings of wrongdoing. Committee investigators said Dollar and the ministry at that time had four airplanes, including the one he wanted to replace with the $65 million Gulfstream.The planeWorld Changers and Dollar made the case for the new jet -- the Gulfstream G650, which is manufactured in Savannah -- after the church’s longtime Gulfstream G1159A, more commonly known as a G-III, was damaged and taken out of service last last year.They said the jet -- built in 1984 and purchased in 1999 -- traveled four million miles and had two recent mishaps: one where the right engine failed near Hawaii enroute to Australia;  and a second in which the airplane’s nose hit a London runway while Dollar’s wife, Taffi, and three of his daughters were aboard.PolitiFact found a National Transportation Safety Board report confirming that older jet received  ""substantial airframe damage"" in the accident that occurred on takeoff from London to Canada. Eight people were on the airplane, including one woman who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia confirmed that the jet likely would need to be replaced if it had substantial airframe damage.But Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group in Washington, said Dollar -- in proposing that the disabled jet be replaced with a $65 million G650 -- was suggesting going from ""the old Honda to the new Rolls Royce.""This 18-seat jet, which won aviation’s most prestigious honor, the Collier Trophy in 2014, is considered the best and fastest high-end corporate jet ever built. It’s the mode of travel for world governments, the very top echelon of business executives and likely the richest of the rich, he said.Does it have cargo space for thousands of pounds of food and other supplies? Experts told us the answer is no.Carrying cargo is not this jet’s mission, Aboulafia said.""If they make that claim [that they were buying the Gulfstream G650 to carry cargo], they're expecting the public to be a lot dumber than it is,"" he said.Cargo space on a business jet is measured in terms of golf bags, Aboulafia said.Steve Cass, vice president for technical marketing and communications with the jet’s manufacturer, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., confirmed the jet’s space limitations.The G650 has room for 18 passengers and 2,500 pounds of baggage, Cass said.We sent an email to Engelmayer asking him to clarify his ""cargo’ comments. He did not respond specifically to that request, but said there is ""no campaign for a plane, and the ministry’s work helping people in need and spreading the gospel continues as it always has.""There is nothing more about this to discuss,"" he said.Rusty Leonard, founder and CEO of MinistryWatch.com said he was ‘disturbed, but not surprised"" to learn Dollar was trying to raise money for a $65 million jet.""This is normal behavior for a prosperity gospel preacher who turns the gospel upside down by making it all about your/their own blessings/success rather than about sacrificially blessing others who are in need as Jesus actually taught,"" he said.His organization does not recommend donating to Dollar’s organizations, Leonard said.Our ruling: Dollar and other leaders in World Changers Church International launched and then dropped a campaign that asked  followers to pony up  $65 million for a top-of-the-line luxury jet. It’s an airplane generally reserved for world leaders, the top crop of business executives and billionaires.One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods -- as well as ministers bringing the Word of God -- to other parts of the world.That argument never got off the runway.It is inaccurate and bordering on ridiculous.We rate it Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,"Dan Patrick errs, saying Texas will end fiscal year with more reserves than other states combined","Texas state government can afford tax cuts and targeted investments and will still have billions of dollars left over, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM.This fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined?We emailed Patrick’s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction—rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state’s expected fiscal-year-end reserves.Per Patrick’s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined.Texas, Alaska outpace other statesPew officialAt the moment, per Pew, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances) providing enough for state government to operate for 79.1 days. ""The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days,"" Erford said.Going forward, Erford noted, the NASBO fall 2014 report indicates Texas projecting a reserve balance of about $8 billion through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, which would run second to the projected year-end reserves for Alaska, $11.4 billion. ""According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas’ reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas’ reserves are not more ‘than the other 49 states combined,’"" Erford said.NASBO chartsTexas appears to have bigger balances than many states. But its predicted totals don’t dwarf all other states’ projected savings combined.Patrick: ‘Unintentional error’After we looked over the charts, Patrick’s office told us Patrick made ""an unintentional error"" in the radio interview.

PANTS-FIRE,Fox News host: Climate scientists 'fabricated' temperature data,"""They're (the White House) actually kind of lucky that we don't cover climate change as much as we should,"" Perino said. ""Because yesterday, it was reported that the temperature readings have been fabricated and it's all blowing up in their faces.""Co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle interjected that it was ""fraud science"" and Perino said, ""Yes, I agree.""""I make no claims about the effect of (temperature) adjustments globally,"" Homewood said. ""I feel that by identifying specific examples, we have moved the debate forward by challenging how adjustments work in practice, and whether we can always rely on them.""Homewood’s concerns center on something most of us don’t think about too often: the massive data files used by climate scientists worldwide to track changes globally and in different regions of the earth.Raw data vs. adjusted dataEvery month, readings from thousands of land-based weather stations around the world are shared through the Global Historical Climatology Network. To measure ocean temperatures, there is a flow of data from buoys and ships. Climate trends play out over long periods of time, and the challenge has been to deal with changes in the way temperature is measured that have nothing to do with the weather itself.For instance, local officials might move a station from a valley to a nearby hilltop. They might change the time of day when they record their measurements from sunrise to sunset. They might change the kind of thermometer they use. In the ocean, the practice once was to haul up a bucket of water. Later, the standard practice was to measure the temperature from the engine’s intake valve.What they do is take the raw temperature readings and apply a boatload of statistical techniques to pick out the most reliable data. Where necessary, they adjust the readings to account for the human factors that would skew the data regardless of what happened with actual temperatures.The controversy voiced by Homewood and others is that they don’t accept those adjustments.NOAA says the adjustments -- as was the case in Paraguay -- are necessary to make valid comparisons.""Such changes in observing systems cause false shifts in temperature readings. Paraguay is one example of where these false shifts artificially lower the true station temperature trend,"" the agency said.Homewood is right that the Paraguay adjustments raised the temperature reported for that station. But what Homewood leaves out, NOAA says, is that nearly half the time the adjustments made by researchers lower the temperature below what was actually recorded.No change in the big picture""The adjustments aren't of such a magnitude that they throw into question the overall increase in global temperature for the past 100-plus years,"" Curry said.An independent group of researchers called Berkeley Earth have the sole goal of working with the raw data and analyzing it for themselves. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with the group.In the United States, with about 5 percent of Earth’s land area, the official data file raised temperatures compared to the original readings. But the same methods lowered the data records in Africa, and for all land-based readings taken together, the adjustments basically made no change at all (the black line).

PANTS-FIRE,"Anti-vaccine claim rooted in bad science, confusion","With a measles outbreak sprouting in 14 states, and Georgia reporting its first case in almost three years, vaccine opponents are reviving claims about the dangers of vaccines against the disease in newsfeeds across the country.An alert reader was skeptical of one Facebook post, reviving a 2012 story that purports to list ""10 outrageous (but true) facts."" It starts with the claim that helped spur the anti-vaccination movement, despite being repeatedly debunked: Childhood shots contain mercury, a powerful neurotoxin with no safe level of use.""Doctors who inject children with vaccines are delusional,"" Mike Adams concludes from his list of claims. ""They are practicing a medical holocaust against humanity.""How could PolitiFact Georgia resist jumping in to such subtlety?Adams declined to speak with us about his conclusions regarding mercury. He referred us instead to studies on his website, most of which deal with effects of methyl mercury.That is a very different chemical from ethyl mercury, a component in the vaccine preservative thimerosal.We’ll get to that difference in a minute. But the story of thimerosal and vaccine safety bears repeating.Early vaccinations carried the risk of dangerous and sometimes lethal bacterial infections, such as a staph infection that killed four children in 1916. Thimerosal was added to vaccines to keep multi-dose vials free from such bacteria starting in the 1930s.In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration held meetings to discuss the idea that thimerosal — then used in three childhood vaccines such as the hepatitis B shot — was damaging immunized infants’ brains and contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses.At the time, Dr. Neal Halsey was the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. The Johns Hopkins pediatrician had long pushed for expanding vaccinations as a way for children to live healthier lives.But he was willing to entertain the idea that thimerosal was helping to impair infant brains, even though there were no data to support the theory.Thimerosal was removed and has not been used as a preservative in any vaccine on the recommended schedule for children since 1999.At the same time, several studies, including ones in 2001 and 2004 from the Institute of Medicine, found no evidence linking vaccines and autism.""There was no convincing evidence that there was any harm from thimerosal, but I felt we would have difficulties with public acceptance of vaccines if we continued its use,"" Halsey said. ""We are not using it anymore. Now the science is definitive that the small amount of thimerosal did not cause autism or any other neurological damage. ""The damage may already have been done, though, regarding public suspicion of vaccines. Like Halsey, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, agreed that the science never supported the theory that thimerosal caused harm.But Offit worried attention to the unproven fear of ""mercury"" was minimizing the proven fear of the diseases the vaccines were designed to keep at bay.""Before there were vaccines, whooping cough killed 8,000 children a year, polio crippled 20,000 kids and killed 1,500 to 2,000,"" Offit said. ""Measles killed 500 children a year and caused 48,000 to be hospitalized. The best way to address safety concerns is not to cater to false ones and focus on those real threats.""Adams also confuses the issue with the interchangeable use of the term ""mercury"" for both thimerosal’s ethyl mercury and the more problematic methyl mercury.Think of ethyl mercury like ethyl alcohol — easily expelled from the human body but dangerous in large quantities. Thimerosal was used in trace amounts in vaccines.Methyl mercury is the compound found in fish and water, which builds up because the body can’t easily expel it. While some amounts occur naturally in the environment, it’s more comparable to methyl alcohol, the methanol that fills your gas tank but isn’t fit for human consumption.Repeated research studies agree that there is no evidence of harm from thimerosal’s mercury compound in vaccines.But there is an even bigger problem with Adams’ claim.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aware of the controversy and confusion, lists all ingredients in childhood vaccines for review.MMR, the vaccine making headlines now, never contained thimerosal. Neither did the shots for chickenpox, polio or others.Thimerosal, remember, was designed to prevent bacterial growth with repeated entry into a vial.Therefore, it wouldn’t be used in single-use vials most common in the United States. And there is no need for a preservative with the live virus vaccines such as measles, said Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review.In other words, our reader was right to be skeptical.There has been debate in the scientific community about removing a mercury compound from some vaccines. But the science has always been clear that there is no evidence that compound causes harm.Bluntly, vaccines help, not hurt.And if you still don’t believe that? Consider that the recipe in question — that is, the series of shots recommended for childhood immunization — does not include the ingredient singled out as the problem.Any claims to the contrary muddy what should be a simple issue.We rate the claim Pants On Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Blog: Sheriffs group cried for Obama to be hanged,"Let’s start with the headlines. The poverty center wrote, ""As Extremist ‘Constitutional Sheriffs’ Meet With Senators, Their Supporters Call for Obama’s Lynching."" Urban Intellectuals shortened that, writing, ""Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators.""The group urged lawmakers to overturn Obama’s decision to defer deportation action against millions of undocumented immigrants.While the sheriffs' antipathy for Obama’s priorities were clear, the actual call for lynching took place out on the streets. According to the poverty center’s article, ""Just down the Capitol Mall that same day, a small group of protesters supporting the sheriffs gathered at the White House and began shouting slogans and demanding the removal of President Obama. Some in the crowd demanded the president be lynched -- ‘Hang the lying Muslim traitor!’ one of them shouted.""The article said that an anti-government group called Operation American Freedom organized that protest. A video in advance of the demonstration said, ""The sheriffs are going to be here doing their rally, and Operation American Freedom, or O.A.F., are going to be there as well,"" according to the article.That line strongly suggests that the sheriffs and the protesters were two distinct groups. In fact, the article goes further to attribute the calls for lynching to a single man.One protester in particular—a bearded man toting an American flag—seemed especially intent on seeing Obama hung.""Hang the lying Kenyan traitor terrorist piece of sh-t,"" he shouted at one point. ""He’s a traitor! Hang him!"" The same man kept shouting variations of this throughout the protest.While the article describes how the sheriffs group mingled with the protesters after their meeting, it gives no indication that any sheriffs participated in the calls for hanging the president.Our rulingThe Urban Intellectuals website said that sheriffs called for Obama’s lynching. The article behind that statement amply describes that there were two separate groups in Washington that day. At no time does the article suggest that any sheriff spoke those words.The headline represents a reckless misreading of a published account.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Scott Walker: Records show Soviets treated Ronald Reagan more seriously after he fired controllers,"Then he turned to Reagan, one of his political heroes, and one of the Republican president’s early acts in office -- the mass firing of most of the nation’s air traffic controllers.In August 1981, after contract talks between the federal government and the union for the controllers stalled, nearly 13,000 controllers walked off the job. Just seven months into his first term, Reagan called the strike illegal and demanded they return to work. When more than 11,000 didn't, Reagan fired them in what was an unprecedented action.In his MSNBC interview, Walker asserted that the move was one of the most important foreign policy decisions ""made in our lifetime,"" showing allies and adversaries around the world ""that we were serious.""Then he added this:""Years later, documents released from the Soviet Union showed that that exactly was the case. The Soviet Union started treating (Reagan) more seriously once he did something like that. Ideas have to have consequences. And I think (President Barack Obama) has failed mainly because he's made threats and hasn't followed through on them.""So, Walker goes beyond stating an opinion about the foreign policy implications of Reagan’s move. He states as fact that there are Soviet documents showing the Soviets treated the Reagan more seriously because he fired American air traffic controllers.That’s a bold claim.Walker's evidenceWhen we asked for evidence to back the claim, both the governor's office and Walker's campaign cited statements from a variety of people. Each essentially said the firings showed Reagan meant what he said, and that he was to be taken seriously.Some examples:Those are perceptions of Americans, however. Walker's claim was the Soviets treated Reagan more seriously after he fired the controllers, and that Soviet documents prove it.  And apparently there are no such documents that have been made public.ExpertsFive experts told us they had never heard of such documents. Several were incredulous at the notion.McCartin, a Georgetown University labor history expert who wrote the book about the strike that Walker cited, said: ""I am not aware of any such documents.  If they did exist, I would love to see them.""Svetlana Savranskaya, director of Russia programs at the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told us she ""had to listen to the Walker interview twice, so ridiculous is the statement about the air traffic controllers. There is absolutely no evidence of this. I would love to see the released Soviet documents on this subject that he has apparently seen.""James Graham Wilson, a historian at the U.S. State Department, also told us he was not aware of any Soviet documents showing Moscow’s internal response to the controller firings. He speculated that there could be such records, given how some Soviet experts characterized the firings.In any case, the lack of Soviet records described by Walker is clear.Reagan's own ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, told us: ""It's utter nonsense. There is no evidence of that whatever.""Matlock questioned whether Soviet leaders even paid much attention to the firings, saying: ""At that point, their big question was whether (Reagan) was going to attack them.""Our ratingTouching on foreign policy issues, Walker said: ""Documents released from the Soviet Union"" show ""the Soviet Union started treating"" Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers.There is a view, echoed by Walker, that the firings caught the Soviets’ attention. But Walker cited no Soviet documents showing that the firings made the Soviets treat Reagan more seriously. And experts, several of whom felt Walker’s claim is outrageous, told us they are not aware that any such documents exist.For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.------More on Scott Walker"
PANTS-FIRE,"Rick Perry, in Iowa, says unemployment rate has 'been massaged, it’s been doctored'","Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who plans to say this spring if he’ll again seek the Republican presidential nomination, questioned the validity of federal unemployment statistics as he otherwise extolled the boom in his home state, according to a reporter in attendance.By phone, Weigel told us Perry made his remark while celebrating his state’s economy and did not take reporter questions.At our request, Weigel later emailed us his fuller transcript showing Perry said: ""We've got the lowest participation rate since the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter was president. I'm talking about participation in the work force. That's of really great concern for me.""Perry continued: ""I mean, who is it standing up for these people that I call the uncounted? They've lost hope that they can even get a job, so they're not even counted. When you look at the unemployment rate today, that's not the true unemployment rate, it's been massaged, it's been doctored,"" Perry said.So we were curious what he meant about the rate being doctored and asked Perry aides to elaborate--without success.Jobless rate an imperfect indicatorNationally, the persistence of discouraged workers and declining workforce participation often come up as criticisms of the jobless rate.Perry’s mention of the official jobless rate leaving out discouraged workers was accurate.After Obama’s latest State of the Union address, PolitiFact rated Mostly True the Democratic leader’s declaration the unemployment rate was the lowest it had been since before the financial crisis that blew up around the time of his 2008 election.And as it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the official unemployment rate -- hasn’t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The national December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008.This gets us to Perry’s mention of labor force participation, which gauges the number of people in the labor force compared to the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up on finding a job.More recently, the labor force participation rate has markedly decreased since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66 percent; it was nearly 63 percent as of December 2014, the most recent month of available data. So, the participation rate is lately at its lowest point since the late 1970s, which also was a time when fewer women had jobs outside the home. This decrease has partly been influenced by the aging of the workforce (as in Baby Boomer retirements).No signs of doctoringThese wrinkles noted, is there evidence the jobless rate has been massaged and doctored, as Perry put it?We found none.None of several experts responding to our inquiries said the unemployment rate has been massaged or doctored.In 2013, economists told PolitiFact it would be extremely difficult to alter the unemployment rate.Shobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country. ""Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats,"" he said.Shobe, reached afresh for this story, said he was unaware of developments that would support the former governor’s claim. ""The whole idea that you could get a group of these statisticians to lie about these survey results they’re collecting and have that stick, that’s just crazy,"" Shobe said.""These are career civil servants. Their incentives are to get the best possible numbers.""Asked to assess Perry’s comment in full, Chinn said: ""It’s true that had the labor force participation rate not declined, and we used the number of employed actually observed to calculate a rate, then mechanically the unemployment rate would have to be higher."" Regardless, he said, it’s not so that government statisticians changed the procedure for calculations in order to change the reported unemployment number – which Chinn said is how he would define ""doctored.""Sinclair speculated by email that Perry’s reference to discouraged workers being left out of the rate means he’d prefer to see the rate calculated with the workers counted. But the words ""massaged"" and ""doctored,"" Sinclair said, each carries a charge, implying the rate is nefariously manipulated. ""We have no evidence of that,"" Sinclair said.Our rulingAddressing Iowans, Perry said the official U.S. jobless rate ""has been doctored, it’s been massaged.""There’s legitimate debate about what statistic best measures the state of the workforce and even agreement that the widely quoted unemployment rate (which Perry stressed as meaningful about a week before this Iowa stop) doesn’t provide the fullest picture of the labor force. But that's a far cry from showing the government is massaging or doctoring numbers, which implies organized underhanded wrongdoing.Perry may yet elaborate. We find this claim factually unsupported and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! "
PANTS-FIRE,Alfonso Lopez says Va. shields ducks better than people from assault weapon violence,"When it comes to protection from assault weapons in Virginia, Del. Alfonso Lopez said ducks have it better than people.In a Jan. 19 floor speech, Lopez said his bill is a response to mass shootings around the nation in recent years, including the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Then, the delegate made an analogy to hunting.""Since 1931, federal law prohibits me from having more than three shotgun shells in my shotgun when I’m duck hunting,"" he said. ""That means that ducks have more protection than people in Virginia.""Let me repeat that: Under the law, ducks have more protection than people in Virginia,"" Lopez said.We took a gander at Lopez’s claim.Does that mean ducks are better protected than people under Virginia laws?The very premise of Lopez’s claim is flawed. It’s legal to hunt ducks in Virginia. If you shoot one with a barred firearm for duck hunting, it’s a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum $500 fine.It’s illegal to shoot people in Virginia with any firearm, except in limited instances of self defense.The murder of person in Virginia is punishable by death or lengthy prison sentences. There’s no jail time for shooting a duck, even if it’s done with an illegal shotgun.Lopez told us he wasn’t trying to argue that Virginia laws protect ducks better than people from being shot. ""I was talking about  the number of bullets and shotgun shells,"" he said, adding that, perhaps, he could have been clearer in his speech. ""I was talking about high capacity guns.""Our rulingIn a speech on the House floor, Lopez said that under Virginia law ""ducks have more protection that people"" from assault gun violence. To drive the point home, he repeated it.There’s simply no basis to this jarring claim. Virginia sanctions duck hunting; it’s a misdemeanor with no jail time if you shoot one with a gun that can hold more than three bullets. It’s a felony to purposefully shoot a person, sometimes punishable by death, and the capacity of firearms doesn’t alter this simple fact.We rate Lopez’s statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Ohio Gov. John Kasich puts words in Abraham Lincoln's mouth about tax policy,"In his argument against President Barack Obama’s proposed increase in capital gains tax, Ohio Gov. John Kasich invoked the words of a vaunted former president -- or at least he tried.To support his position, he relayed a quote that he said comes from former President Abraham Lincoln.There’s only one problem. Lincoln never said that.In 1916, Boetcker published the list of ""10 Cannots,"" a collection of personal truisms largely centered around the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. The axioms have been mistakenly attributed to Lincoln for decades.Here are all 10 Cannots (Kasich used No. 3.):1. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.2. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.3. You cannot help little men by tearing down big men.4. You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.5. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.6. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money.7. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.8. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.9. You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence.10. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves.In 1916, Boetcker published leaflets that had a real Lincoln quote on one side and his ""cannots"" on the other. A reader could easily assume these were also Lincoln quotes, and they did.Reagan said, ""What (Democrats) truly don't understand is the principle so eloquently stated by Abraham Lincoln: ‘You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.’ ""So we’ve established that Lincoln did not say that line Kasich used to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy -- ""You cannot help little men by tearing down big men."" But we were left wondering if, in any case, does this at all line up with Lincoln’s position on taxes? As it turns out, not really.Lincoln and taxesWell, Lincoln signed the first federal income taxes into law in 1861 in order to fund the Civil War. What’s more is that these taxes were progressive -- meaning that the wealthier people paid higher tax rates on their income. The highest rate -- 5 percent -- applied to incomes roughly equivalent to $1 million today, Prokopowicz told PolitiFact in an email.""To the extent that signing the bill indicated his approval, Lincoln thus approved of the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy,"" he said. ""This is consistent with Lincoln's politics generally.""Much of the debate over the Civil War income tax laws centered around whether Lincoln had the constitutional authority to impose these taxes, said Jennifer Weber, a Lincoln expert at the University of Kansas. (In 1881, the Supreme Court held up Lincoln’s authority.)In a reminder of how much political parties have changed, Weber noted that it was the conservative Democrats taking Lincoln, a Republican, to task over executive overreach and implementing taxes.There is ""precious little"" record of Lincoln’s views on taxes, said Ed Steers, author of several books on the Lincoln assassination. But he pointed us to a speech Lincoln delivered to the 164th Ohio Infantry in 1864, where he advocated for the progressive tax law.Lincoln said: ""It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes on each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all. ""Prokopowicz added that Lincoln believed strongly in ""opportunity capitalism"" and that the government should not adopt policies that would prevent anyone from acquiring wealth. However, Lincoln also believed that the government had a vital role in creating opportunity, and individuals ought to contribute to the government in order to reap its benefits.""I go for all sharing the privileges of the government, who assist in bearing its burthens,"" Lincoln wrote in 1836 while running for the Illinois state Legislature.Our rulingKasich said that Lincoln said, ""You can’t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down.""It’s well-established that this is not a Lincoln quote. Many have misattributed it to Lincoln, but its real author was a politically conservative minister and public speaker who was born several years after Lincoln’s assassination.Additionally, Kasich used the idea to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy. Lincoln, however, instituted the first-ever federal income tax, and it was progressive.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."

Three Birmingham wards, Heath, Bordesley Green and Sparkbrook, had Muslim populations that exceeded half of the population, all ranging from 70 percent to about 77 percent.Not that this gives any credence to Emerson’s claim about the city of Birmingham as a whole. This does not amount to the city ""being totally Muslim.""I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error. And I am issuing this apology and correction for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful.

PANTS-FIRE,"What will happen to taxes on Jan. 1, 2015? Chain email gets tax rates all wrong","The start of a new year traditionally offers the possibility of rebirth. Apparently, that goes for chain emails, too.Now, readers are flooding the PolitiFact inbox asking whether a new version of the email -- keyed to a new date, Jan. 1, 2015 -- is accurate. It isn’t, and we’ll explain why.Here’s the text of the email that’s currently circulating:Reminder for those who forgot or for many that didn't know Here is what will happen on January 1, 2015 :Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%   Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%   Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%   Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%   Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%   Estate tax went from 0% to 55%   Remember this fact:   These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes.   These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. If you think that it is important that everyone in the U.S. should know this, pass it  on. If not, then delete it.We’ll take these claims in order:To the extent that these tax rates were changed -- and as we’ll see most of them didn’t change in the way the email says -- the changes didn’t take effect on Jan. 1, 2015 (or, for that matter, on Jan. 1, 2014). They took effect on Jan. 1, 2013.That may seem like a minor difference, but in this case, it makes all the difference.The law made permanent many but not all of the Bush-era tax cuts that were set to expire anyway. So some people did see their tax rates go up, primarily upper-income taxpayers. That’s what the email is attempting to spotlight, but it does so in a way that introduces a host of inaccuracies.""Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%""""Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%""Usually, people think about income taxes and payroll taxes separately. But it’s not uncommon for tax experts to look at the combination of income and payroll taxes together, because they give a sense of the overall burden of direct taxation on individuals. That’s what the email did here.On Jan. 1, 2013, the top combined rate for the income and payroll tax went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent, or 43.4 percent due to the additional Medicare tax in the health care law.So if you just look at the federal rates, the email overstates the current top rate.If you take state taxes into account, the email is closer, but still inaccurate. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, calculated 2013 combined tax rates for each state. The group found that the top marginal tax rate, averaged across all states, is 47.9 percent.Of course, any state taxes would have been imposed by state governments, and thus were not part of the Affordable Care Act. And this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison; to make the comparison fair, the initial tax rate would need to be adjusted upward for state and local taxes as well.""Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%""On Jan. 1, 2013, the highest capital gains tax rate rose from 15 percent to 20 percent. The Affordable Care Act’s additional 3.8 percent Medicare tax for high-income earners can be added to make it 23.8 percent. Either way you calculate it, the email exaggerates the amount of the increase. (And most households still pay nothing or 15 percent for capital gains, depending on their income.)""Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%""This line would have been correct if the Bush tax cuts had expired the way they were initially supposed to. But the December 2012 deal ended up going with a top marginal tax rate of 20 percent on dividend income instead of the pre-Bush rate of 39.6 percent on dividend income. It rose to 23.8 percent due to the high-income added Medicare tax under Obamacare.So the final rate cited in the email is far higher than the current rate.Both ends of this claim are wrong. The estate tax was gradually wound down by the Bush-era tax cuts, disappearing entirely, for one year, in 2010. For 2011 and 2012 it was reimposed at 35 percent, then raised to 40 percent on Jan. 1, 2013 as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" bill.""These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.""Most of these changes were passed as part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, which was enacted with bipartisan support. Facing expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would have meant a massive tax increase up and down the income scale, both parties felt compelled to strike a deal that neither side was really enthusiastic about.It’s also incorrect to say that these taxes were all raised by Obamacare. The health care law did add marginally to three of the five taxes -- it was the source of the Medicare tax hike from from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent, and it added 0.9 percentage points to the top payroll tax rate and 3.8 percentage points to the the capital gains and the dividends tax. But the bulk of the increases came from the fiscal cliff deal. Less than a third of the total percentage-point increases cited by the email came from Obamacare.Our rulingThe chain email said that new tax increases went into effect on Jan. 1, 2015, ""all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.""The email gets many things wrong, most notably scaring people by saying their tax rates will go up on New Year’s Day 2015. In addition, most of the rates cited are wrong in some way, and are uniformly higher than the actual rates. And the email is flat-out wrong when it blames Democrats, and Obamacare for the increases. The bulk of the tax hikes stem from a different bill entirely -- one that received support from a large majority of Senate Republicans and a significant minority of House Republicans.Despite some minor changes since the last version of the email that circulated, this one is so riddled with errors -- and gets so few things correct -- that we continue to rate it Pants on Fire.Help fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.

PANTS-FIRE,Giuliani: Obama 'propaganda' says 'everybody should hate the police',"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blamed President Barack Obama for anti-police ""propaganda"" that eventually led to the shooting death of two New York City police officers.""We’ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police,"" Giuliani said. ""The protests are being embraced, the protests are being encouraged. The protests, even the ones that don’t lead to violence, a lot of them lead to violence, all of them lead to a conclusion: The police are bad, the police are racist. That is completely wrong.""Giuliani’s claim that Obama said something akin to ""everybody should hate the police"" struck us as overheated right off the bat, so we decided to look into it. We asked Giuliani for a response but we didn't hear back. In response to his most recent comments, we sifted through Obama’s statements and interviews on the subject since August, when the situation first bubbled up after a white police officer killed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Even the most distorted readings of Obama’s remarks cannot be interpreted as encouraging people to ""hate the police.""Obama has repeatedly emphasized that the work police do is dangerous to themselves but very important to the community. He has said that although ""a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement"" (an oft-repeated talking point), the vast majority of law enforcement officers do not carry out the law in a discriminatory manner. He has also argued that improvement -- achieved through peaceful and cooperative means -- is necessary.Part of Giuliani’s point is that Obama has been empathetic to the protesters, which he has been -- though cautiously so. And he has always discouraged violent protests and excessive police response.Here’s a selection of telling passages from Obama’s comments on race and the criminal justice system since August. We fail to see how they support Guiliani’s point.There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.  There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.... Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.I’ve said this before -- in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement... This is not an argument that there isn’t real crime out there, and that law enforcement doesn't have a difficult job and that they have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty of law enforcement.Sept. 28, speech at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner:In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement… One recent poll showed that the majority of Americans think the criminal justice system doesn’t treat people of all races equally…. And that has a corrosive effect -- not just on the black community; it has a corrosive effect on America. It harms the communities that need law enforcement the most. It makes folks who are victimized by crime and need strong policing reluctant to go to the police because they may not trust them.  Nov. 24, remarks following a grand jury’s decision not to indict the officer who shot Brown:Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They’ve got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law…. The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country. And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates…. There are issues in which the law too often feels as if it is being applied in discriminatory fashion. I don't think that's the norm. I don't think that's true for the majority of communities or the vast majority of law enforcement officials. But these are real issues.Dec. 1, remarks after meeting with community and law enforcementFerguson laid bare a problem that is not unique to St. Louis or that area, and is not unique to our time, and that is a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color…. We also heard law enforcement and were reminded of what a tough job it is to be in law enforcement. Whether you’re in a big city or in a small community, as (Attorney General) Eric Holder put it, police officers have the right to come home. And if they’re in dangerous circumstances, we have to be able to put ourselves in their shoes and recognize that they do have a tough job.I say that as somebody who believes that law enforcement has an incredibly difficult job, that every man or woman in uniform are putting their lives at risk to protect us, that they have the right to come home, just like we do from our jobs, that there’s real crime out there that they’ve got to tackle day in and day out -- but that they’re only going to be able to do their job effectively if everybody has confidence in the system. And right now, unfortunately, we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly. And in some cases, those may be misperceptions; but in some cases, that’s a reality. Dec. 8, interview with BETAnd one of the things that I want us to make sure we understand is that, communities of color need good law enforcement. I mean, there’s a lot of crime, and one of the things that we talked about on Monday here was you’ve got young people who end up getting caught between police that they don’t trust and folks on the streets who are trying to rough them up…. And I’ve said it before: The vast majority of law enforcement officers are doing a really tough job, and most of them are doing it well and are trying to do the right thing.  But a combination of bad training, in some cases; a combination in some cases of departments that really are not trying to root out biases, or tolerate sloppy police work; a combination in some cases of folks just not knowing any better, and in a lot of cases, subconscious fear of folks who look different -- all of this contributes to a national problem that’s going to require a national solution.Our rulingGiuliani said Obama has said ""that everybody should hate the police.""Throughout all of his comments since August, when the latest unrest over racial disparities in the criminal justice system began, Obama has continuously encouraged working with police to find solutions and make change. He has also repeatedly emphasized the importance of law enforcement in communities of color and the fact that police officers have a dangerous job.Giuliani’s claim is an outlandish distortion of what Obama actually said.

PANTS-FIRE,Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov says 80% of U.S. lawmakers have never traveled abroad,"Are American lawmakers rubes who never travel outside the United States? Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, seems to think so.Lavrov dismissed the measure and proceeded to tweak the legislative institutions that passed it.""Congress is a very special group of people,"" Lavrov said. ""More than 80 percent of them never left the United States. They live in their own walls. So I’m not amazed about this Russophobia which is being displayed by the Congress at the moment.""Lavrov didn’t look like he was joking in the interview, so we’re taking the claim at face value. Here’s what we found. (An inquiry to the Russian Embassy in Washington was not returned.)Because calling up all 535 members of the House and Senate and asking them about their lifetime travel histories would be prohibitively time-consuming, we figured the fastest way to test Lavrov’s claim would be to look at lawmakers’ records of official travel.We cross-checked the two lists and found 20 House members who took a CODEL during that six-month period but had never taken a privately financed overseas trip. So that raised the number of confirmed members of Congress who had gone overseas at least once to 432 out of 535 members, or 81 percent.In other words, Lavrov got the percentage who had gone overseas almost exactly backwards.""I think it’s likely to be close to 100 percent who have done official travel of some kind overseas,"" Friedly told PolitiFact.And of course, none of these numbers touch any foreign travel taken in the lawmakers’ personal lives, either as children or adults.Our rulingLavrov said, ""Congress is a very special group of people. More than 80 percent of them never left the United States.""Actually, the data shows that at least 81 percent of members in the recently concluded Congress have taken overseas trips on official business, and the actual percentage is almost certainly higher once all sorts of travel are included, including personal travel completed before being elected to Congress.We rate his claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Appointee Wallace Hall says Joe Straus said he didn't care if Hall was strung from a tree,"According to a University of Texas System regent who’s under criminal investigation, the Republican speaker of the Texas House indicated he didn’t care if the regent got strung up.After saying his own questions about ""unusual admissions"" practices at UT led to a special House committee’s impeachment proceedings, Hall added: ""And this quote from the speaker of the House before a large audience: ‘I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.’ This from the same speaker who claims his job is not to protect the citizens, but his (House) members.""Of course, he did not attempt to confront me personally,"" Hall said. ""Does that seem odd to you? Instead he set up an experimental investigative committee to force me to quit and, failing that, destroy my reputation."" Hall said he also was threatened with investigations by the Department of Public Safety and FBI and is waiting, like his wife and children, to see if he’s indicted in Travis County.That tree-swinging mention struck us as provocative enough to verify.Hall offered no comment in response to our emailed inquiries nor did Straus engage.Straus interviewed in 2013From an online search, though, we learned that Straus talked about Hall and a tree in a public interview during the 2013 Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.In the Sept. 28, 2013, interview, Straus described his expectations of a special House panel formed to consider leveling impeachment charges against Hall. In August 2014, that panel censured and admonished Hall, listing his relentless demands for records from UT-Austin, his handling of confidential student records and his efforts to oust the university’s president, Bill Powers, who later announced his plans to step down. Hall’s defenders, including Perry, say he has simply exercised his oversight duties as a regent.As of mid-December 2014, Hall remained under investigation by the Travis County district attorney’s Public Integrity Unit, in part for his handling of confidential student information.Straus said in the 2013 interview: ""I want a fair, thorough, complete investigation. ...Wherever the trail leads, that’s where we’ll go.""Our transcript picks up with Tribune reporter Jay Root:ROOT: ""What have you heard about the allegations against Wallace Hall that either just don’t disturb you, that think that it’s even appropriate to even be talking about?...""STRAUS: ""I don’t know. I don’t want to prejudge what the committee and the investigation is going to turn up. And I don’t, I don’t want to say I don’t care. But I have, I have no bias here. I don’t, I don’t care whether they, whether they give the guy a medal of honor or hang him from a tree. I don’t know, I don’t know, I have no idea.ROOT: ""Hang him from a tree, really?"" (crowd laughter)STRAUS: ""Well, you know, not literally. But my point is whether the report is harshly critical and leads to some impeachable offense and makes that recommendation or whether it says Wallace Hall is the greatest... regent that’s ever been in the history of Texas, hands off, give him some kind of resolution in his honor. I don’t know. And I’m not gonna know until the investigation is complete.""Our rulingAccording to Hall, Straus said, ""I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.""Straus said close to that, but he said in the same breath he’d likewise be open to a special panel deciding Hall deserved to be honored. Overall, the speaker made it clear he wasn’t judging Hall in advance of the committee’s review -- which is hardly how Hall characterized Straus' attitude.With all this detail available in the online video of the Straus interview, Hall’s statement shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"Peter King says Senate CIA report found detainees were not killed, did not suffer 'lasting injuries'","Rep. Peter King brushed off a new Senate report on the CIA interrogation program as a partisan, one-sided account.Nothing to see here, people. Move along.""This is not a case where people were killed,"" he said.""We’re not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that,"" he added. ""We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth. But again, nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this.""Even an ancillary reading of the Senate report’s executive summary — a 600-page document that is only one-tenth of the still-classified full study — finds King’s comments to be dubious.King’s staff did not respond to requests for comment.""Not a case where people were killed""Let’s put to bed one false claim King made off the bat: that no one was killed.In fact, someone did die as a result of the interrogation program.In 2002, the CIA interrogated Gul Rahman at Cobalt, an overseas detention center with an undisclosed location described as a dungeon. Many of the controversial interrogations outlined in the report took place at Cobalt.Rahman, described in the report as a suspected Islamic extremist, underwent ""48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower, and rough treatment,"" according to communications with CIA headquarters. Later, Rahman was shackled to the wall and made to lie on a cold concrete floor. He was stripped of all of his clothes except a sweatshirt. In the morning, guards discovered Rahman was dead, likely from hypothermia.""Not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that""The report describes how detainees at Cobalt were subject to something called ""rough takedowns"" that included physical abuse. ""Approximately five CIA officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut his clothes off, and secure him with Mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched.""These takedowns were ""thoroughly planned and rehearsed"" and did cause physical harm to detainees. Rahman, for example, had abrasions on his face, legs, and hands, medical examiners found.One of the most discussed elements of the CIA report is the use of ""rectal feeding"" or ""rectal rehydration."" In at least five cases, detainees were force fed through their anus. In one instance, a lunch of ""hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was ‘pureed’ and rectally infused"" into a  detainee named Majid Khan, the report said.While current and former CIA officials have defended the practice as medically necessary, Physicians for Human Rights said in a statement that rectal feedings are, ""a form of sexual assault masquerading as medical treatment."" The CIA’s chief of interrogations characterized rectal feeding as a demonstration of ""total control,"" the report said. Additionally, an unidentified individual in the report said the procedure was used to make people talk and helped to ""clear a person’s head.""One detainee, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, as a result of rectal feeding was ""later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse,"" the report said.These instances of physical harm directly contradict King’s description.""We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions""King’s statement significantly downplays what detainees endured.For starters, they were not just made to stand in awkward positions. That tactic was used in addition to sleep deprivation methods that required detainees remain awake for up to 180 hours.Additionally, two detainees broke bones in their feet while trying to escape capture. Despite a CIA physician recommending they stay off their feet for several weeks, the two detainees were placed in ""standing sleep deprivation."" One of the detainees was kept awake on his feet for 52 hours, the other for an undisclosed amount of time.Similar tactics were used on a detainee with a sprained ankle and on a detainee with a prosthetic leg.Detainees were often naked and shackled with their hands above their head in complete darkness and loud music blasting.In April 2006, President George W. Bush ""expressed discomfort"" when shown images of a detainee ""chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself,"" according to the reports’ account of CIA documents.""Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this""You could probably successfully argue that death is a pretty lasting injury. As were the chronic hemorrhoids and anal fissure suffered by the detainee who faced rectal feeding.But there were additional injuries as well.Abu Zubaydah, a high-level target, was captured in a raid during which he sustained a gunshot wound. Despite the obvious need for medical attention, care was instead withheld to convey that it  was contingent on Zubaydah’s cooperation. The wound eventually deteriorated due to a ""combination of a lack of hygiene, sub-optimal nutrition, inadvertent trauma to the wound secondary to some of the stress techniques utilized at that stage, and the removal of formal obvious medical care,"" the report said.Zubaydah also lost an eye in custody and was subjected to waterboarding, a procedure that simulates drowning. In one session, he ""became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth."" He was revived and vomited large amounts of water.Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often described as the architect of the 9-11 plots, was waterboarded 183 times over 15 sessions.While King alleged no lasting injuries from this technique, the report indicates otherwise, said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University.""Methods were approved that if used only very sporadically might not have caused permanent damage, but they were used in combination and repeatedly over a course of sometimes weeks or months,"" Schanzer said. ""I think to write off those kinds of compounded injuries as being insignificant is totally inconsistent with the facts.""Our rulingKing said, ""Nobody suffered any lasting injuries"" as a result of the CIA enhanced interrogation program. He also said downplayed the methods, claiming it was ""not a case where people were killed,"" and that the techniques amounted to ""people being made to stand in awkward in positions.""This is the opposite of what the report showed. One need not agree with everything in it to conclude that someone did die, an eye was lost, detainees were made to stand on broken limbs and deprived of sleep for 180 hours. It’s as if King didn’t read the report before he went on the radio. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Social media meme says number of unemployed has risen sharply under Barack Obama,"But that hasn’t stopped criticism about weak job gains from circulating on social media.Around the time the new job numbers were being released, a reader asked us to check a meme circulating on social media.The meme’s claim was so out of step with recent jobs data that we decided to delve into the official numbers produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.First, we looked at the most basic measure: How many people were officially categorized as unemployed in January 2009, compared to the number today?We found that there were almost 12.1 million Americans classified as unemployed in 2009, and a bit over 9.1 million in November 2014. Not only are both of the specific job figures in the meme way off-base, but the trend line is even less accurate -- the number of unemployed Americans has declined by 3 million, or by one-fourth, since Obama took office.Tweaking the time frame doesn’t help, either. If you look at the weakest point of Obama’s tenure -- October 2009 -- there were a little less than 15.4 million unemployed Americans, making the decline to today even steeper -- 6.3 million people, or a 41 percent decline. Similarly, pushing the end time to earlier in 2014 (when the meme may have been made) doesn’t change the overall picture.Could the meme creator have been using a different, broader measurement to define the term ""out of work""? Just in case, we took another crack with expanded measures.First, we added together three struggling groups -- the number of people who are unemployed, the number of people who are officially employed but are working part-time because of economic headwinds, and the number of ""discouraged"" workers who want to work but have stopped looking and thus aren’t counted as being in the labor force. Did the combination of these three categories support the meme’s message?No. In January 2009, this broader measurement of employment distress included 20.8 million people, a number that fell to 16.7 million people by November 2014 -- a decline of 4.1 million, or about one-fifth. This statistic doesn’t support the meme’s claims, either.We asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, whether he could think of any statistic we overlooked. He said we could have considered a particular state, such as California, which is both large and has struggled economically. But when he looked at the numbers, he found that California’s unemployment level was 1.87 million in January 2009 and dropped to 1.31 million by October 2014, the latest month available. So this doesn’t support the meme either.The person who created meme ""appears to be very far removed from the national-level unemployment statistics,"" Burtless said.Our rulingThe meme claims that when Obama took office, ""2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work.""No national figure produces the specific numbers cited in the meme -- and, more importantly, the direction of the changes are flatly opposite to what the meme claims. By almost every metric you can use to calculate the number of Americans who are ""out of work,"" the number has been going down, not up.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Jesse Ventura says the Nazis pioneered the use of fluoridated water,"Were Nazis the first to put fluoride in the water?""I worry about it tremendously. We’re forever incorporating Nazi things into our lives. Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis! I don’t particularly like anything the Nazis did too much, and they were the first ones to put fluoride in the water. They tell us, ‘Oh, it’s for your teeth’ and all that — well, isn’t that your parents’ job, to teach you how to brush your teeth and use mouthwash? Why do you need the government putting some type of chemical in your water? I don’t know if you know this [but] fluoride is the main component of Prozac! What you’ve got is people drinking Prozac-water. Well, what does Prozac do to you? It calms you and dumbs you down so you’re less emotional. There’s a reason for all that stuff; what do we need fluoride in our water for? There’s no reason whatsoever to put chemicals in our water.""Nazis, who killed millions of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, were known for chemical tests and inhumane medical experiments. Far be it from us to defend them, even in a minor way.But after tracking down the roots of claims about fluoride on the Web, reaching out to Holocaust historians, contacting well-known critics of water fluoridation, and reading book excerpts, magazine articles, and news stories, we concluded that there's no teeth to this claim.With a national celebrity now making the claim, we decided to put it in the spotlight again.""If those facts are false, then the information we received when doing research for the water conspiracy episode was wrong,"" Ventura told PolitiFact in an email. ""Regardless of if the Nazis did it or not, I don't think we should have it in our water. You don't need the government putting chemicals in the water. It's your responsibility to brush your teeth and use mouthwash. I haven't had a house yet with fluoridated water."" (He’s only used well water.)***When we originally fact-checked this claim, we contacted historian Patricia Heberer-Rice of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, whose expertise is the German medical community, including Holocaust-era experimentation.Meanwhile, in the concentration camp system, as in the ghettos, it would have been surprising if fluoride delivery was a focus — in the final few days before liberation, water lines scarcely delivered water. So, would water have been treated just for the Jews?""I can't see it,"" she said.But she had heard a similar Cold War-era theory. It wasn't about the Nazis fluoridating water. It was the Communists.We re-connected with Heberer-Rice for this fact-check, and she told us that no additional evidence supporting Ventura’s claim had emerged in the three years since our last fact-check.""The first mass fluoridation of drinking water was carried out by the U.S. Public Health Service on a trial basis in certain regions of this country in 1945, with its rapid extension in 1950,"" she said. ""The first interest of German scientists in this approach was in 1949"" -- that is, years after the Nazis had been deposed.***""Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him,"" says a document quoted in the excerpt. ""Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile.""But even Bryson -- a backer of certain conspiracies involving fluoridation -- isn’t convinced by the Nazi connection. His book mentions Nazis or Nazism fewer than 10 times, and none of the references discuss water fluoridation.""I never came across any documentation or credible information showing that fluoride was used in Nazi death camps,"" he told us in 2011.***The hydrologists dedicate more than 30 pages to conspiracy theories and their origins. We contacted one of the co-authors in 2011.""The World War II death camp statement is an absurd lie,"" said Jay Lehr, who has authored or co-authored more than 30 books, most of them self-described ""boring science books for scientists.""""We have done our level best to discourage opponents of fluoridation from using this emotive argument,"" Connett said. ""The historical evidence for this assertion is extremely weak. It is sad that the U.S. media has done such a bad job of educating the public on this issue that it is so easy for crazy ideas to fill the vacuum.""Our rulingVentura said, ""Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis!""Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication. And a Holocaust historian we contacted knew of no such project. This claim remains Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Viral photo of Ferguson protester doesn't withstand close scrutiny,"In the wake of several high-profile confrontations between white police officers and unarmed African-Americans recently, social media has become a major source of accusations, arguments -- and hoaxes.Recently, a reader sent us a photo that has been circulating on social media, showing an African-American protester standing in front of a fire station and holding up a hand-lettered sign that reads, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store.""The sign is an obvious reference to the death of Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Brown’s death became a focus for both peaceful protests and rioting in Ferguson, and it attracted attention around the nation and the world. On Nov. 25, a grand jury decided not to indict, setting off a new wave of demonstrations.The phrase ""every time he robs a store"" refers to surveillance footage showing Brown earlier that day robbing a store of cigarillos and assaulting a store employee. Supporters of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, have said the robbery is an important piece of context in explaining Wilson’s shooting of Brown.Still, the PolitiFact reader asked us whether the photo was real or manufactured, so we decided to take a look.The starkly divergent messages of the three signs provide a clue that something is amiss. And indeed, something is amiss.Our rulingA photograph that went viral purports to show a protester in Ferguson, holding a sign that said, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store."" However, the photo was manipulated by a social media user, who later acknowledged the alteration. The change in wording turns the sign’s message completely on its head, so we rate the claim Pants On Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Meme says Barack Obama has given 'no special recognition' to police killed in action,"Recent events in Ferguson, Mo., have inspired waves of anger on social media. Recently, a reader asked us to check one of the memes now circulating on the Internet.The meme pairs two images. One captures several flag-draped coffins, presumably of law enforcement officers. The other is a still from surveillance footage showing Michael Brown allegedly assaulting an employee at a convenience store that he’s suspected of robbing the day he was killed by police officer Darren Wilson.To these images, the meme adds the following text:""Want to know where racial tension and cultural divide comes from?""794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House.""A man robs a convenience store and assaults a cop; the White House sends three representatives to his memorial service.""The meme appears to stem from the ""Culture Crisis in America"" Facebook community, which describes itself as ""an e-magazine for Americans subscribing to the notion that the cultural deterioration of American values rests within the root of economic and social crises across our land, and indeed, the globe.""Here, we'll focus on the meme's claim that Obama has been indifferent to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, giving them ""no special recognition."" Is that correct?Have 794 officers been killed in the line of duty since Obama was inaugurated?That’s smaller than what was cited in the meme, but given the diversity of criteria that can be used to calculate this statistic, we’re not overly concerned about the meme’s number. (The Officer Down Memorial Page, for instance, counts deaths off-duty ""while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer."")One footnote: The numbers of fallen officers have been declining rather noticeably in recent years. According to the FBI statistics, the number of officers killed initially rose from 96 in 2009 to 128 in 2010, but then began falling, to 125, then 96 and finally to 76 in 2013. That’s a 41 percent decline in three years.Has there been ""no special recognition from the White House"" for fallen officers?This is where the meme is entirely off-base. We found many instances of White House ""special recognition"" for fallen officers. Here’s a selection of events where Obama has appeared, all archived a few quick keystrokes away on the White House website:Excerpt from proclamation:""As a nation, we rely on law enforcement officers to keep our neighborhoods safe, enforce our laws, and respond in times of crisis. These men and women sustain peace and order across America, and we look to them as models of courage and integrity. This week, we honor their extraordinary service and sacrifice, and we remember the fallen heroes whose selfless acts have left behind safer streets and stronger communities.""Excerpt from Obama’s remarks:""To the survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, our hearts go out to you for your loss. The husbands and wives, mothers and fathers you loved, they protected us all. And all Americans are grateful for the lives that they gave in the line of duty.""Excerpt from Obama’s remarks:""Tomorrow we know that you and your fellow first responders will be back on your diligent duty -- looking out for us, looking out for one another, looking back at times with fallen partners, determined to make sure that their extraordinary sacrifices were not in vain. And we will be standing behind you, as one nation and one people, proud of your actions, awed by your courage, and grateful for your service on our behalf.""Excerpt from Obama’s remarks:Excerpt from Obama’s remarks:""Scripture tells us, ‘None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.’ The brave officers we gather to remember today devoted themselves so fully to others -- to serve and to protect others -- that in the process they were willing to give their lives. And so, today, let us not remember them just for how they died, but also for how they lived. … We can never repay our debt to these officers and their families, but we must do what we can, with all that we have, to live our lives in a way that pays tribute to their memory.""Excerpt from proclamation:""During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives. As we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived.""Our rulingThe Facebook meme said that ""794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House.""While the meme offered a reasonable approximation for the number of fallen officers, the meat of its accusation -- that Obama has ignored the suffering of law enforcement officers killed in action -- is demonstrably wrong. We found at least six instances in which Obama honored the lives of fallen officers in writing or in speeches.Archived information about these events was easily available to the public on the White House website, meaning that the meme’s creator was reckless in not taking them into account. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Martinez says Steve Adler hasn't been active in anything that has to do with Austin's City Hall,"Austin mayoral candidate Mike Martinez says his opponent, Steve Adler, lacks experience in municipal matters.Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, asked us to look into Martinez’s claim.Asked how Martinez reached his conclusion, Martinez spokesman Nick Hudson emailed: ""Mike meant something specific when he made this statement. While Mike Martinez has been on the Austin City Council for nearly eight years and has a near-perfect attendance record, Steve Adler has not, to our knowledge, ever taken an active role in our local government by appearing before Council on an item.""That’s a way to get to ""never.""To be sure, Adler has been running as a City Hall outsider eager to get city government moving in a fresh direction. Wick told us Adler never has been on a council-appointed board or commission.Adler also has volunteered in causes that connected with city government, Wick wrote.The story said: ""The idea is for the group – which includes"" Travis County’s district and county attorneys, the Austin Police Department, ""University of Texas and Austin Independent School District police, members of the Anti-Defam­ation League, Out Youth, and other civil rights groups, among others – to identify and develop an approach to dealing with hate-motivated violence ‘before, during, and after’ it happens.""By phone, attorney Karen Gross, a former ADL staff member, told us she and Adler helped launch the task force by reaching out to any group with a possible stake in the collaboration of city, county and non-governmental entities.Wick said Adler also had a hand in writing the city’s cultural master plan.By telephone, Janet Seibert, the city’s civic arts program consultant, said the members were chosen by city staff.The report says the city’s Cultural Arts Division launched the CreateAustin ""strategic planning process"" in September 2006 because the city ""wanted to review and refine municipal roles and responsibilities for cultural support, but that was only half of it. The City recognized they couldn’t support arts, culture and creative industries alone. They sought to trigger and develop community leadership to explore major issues and develop strategies to sustain the creative culture of Austin.""The leadership council, the report said, ""met regularly to review research, findings and community input in order to help shape the cultural plan."" Adler, the report says, was on the  body’s Cultural Infrastructure task force. Adler co-chaired that task force, Seiberg said to our query. She said the Austin City Council accepted the master plan in June 2010.Our rulingMartinez said Adler has ""never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall.""Adler hasn’t been a member of city boards or commissions and we accept Martinez’s assertion Adler hasn’t addressed the council. Then again, Adler had a leadership hand in developing the hate crimes task force and the city’s cultural master plan.All told, this never/anything statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"No, the Kochs won't make $100 billion from the Keystone XL pipeline","Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline are stoking fear about the project by connecting it to two of the biggest bogeymen in politics: Charles and David Koch.Take it with a block of salt, a PunditFact analysis finds.The $100 billion estimate is far from a neutral analyst’s prediction, based instead on the far-out calculations of a group that wants the pipeline, and the Koch brothers, to fail. Here’s what you need to know.Keystone and Kochs in contextHow you get $100 billionIn PunditFact terminology, that would be Pants on Fire.The group came up with two different numbers -- experts didn’t vouch for either -- and multiplied them together to come up with Kochs' potential profits.Multiply one by the other and you get $90 billion. Round it up by $10 billion and you get headlines.Counting the waysWe consulted four experts in energy economics and the petroleum industry to review the forum’s report and offer their analysis. They pointed out 10 significant flaws.Our rulingThe claim here is that the Koch brothers will turn a $100 billion profit if the Keystone XL pipeline is constructed, essentially doubling their net worth.As we’ve shown, the Kochs hold oil leases in Canada. We're not ruling out that they could benefit in some ways from the Keystone XL pipeline. But trying to extrapolate their oil-sands leases into a specific profit figure is sheer folly.

PANTS-FIRE,Social media post says Barack Obama-backed bill will offer free cars to welfare recipients,"Does the ""welfare queen"" now have a new car and gas card to go along with her trusty Obama phone? A recent claim circulating on the Internet says she does.""Recently, the White House announced a plan to offer free vehicles to welfare recipients. According to reports, the bill passed in a narrow vote. The program was initiated by President Barack Obama, and in many way mirrors what has become known as ‘The Obama Phone’, or the program through which welfare recipients can get free cell phone service.""John Earnest announced the program launch, stating ‘The free automobile program gives low-income Americans the opportunity to take ownership of a vehicle at no cost, and will also include a monthly gas card for $100.’""Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that this passing will be the downfall of President Obama."" ‘This absurd plan that the democrats have conjured up is beyond belief. I have no idea how or why congress passed this,’ McConnell stated.""The story earned more than 80,000 Facebook likes by Nov. 17, but here’s the deal: It's not accurate. There was no such bill proposed by the Obama administration, and Congress did not pass any such measure. The White House spokesman is Josh Earnest, not John Earnest. (The premise is also kind of amusing -- Congress hasn’t been in the habit of passing Obama initiatives for some time now, whether by a ""narrow"" margin or not.)Rather, the claim originated at an acknowledged fake-news site.As for the idea that the federal government has established a welfare program involving no-cost gas cards and cars for low-income Americans -- well, this is pure fiction.American News offers a mixture of ads and has no information about the site or who runs it. But it includes many fake, yet often nominally believable, articles ripped from other sources that attract clicks from social media users and, presumably, Web revenue for American News.Our rulingThis post on social media claims that welfare recipients, thanks to Obama, will be eligible for a free vehicle and monthly gas cards. But it was ripped straight from a fake news website. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,First execution under Obamacare death panels? Pants on Fire!,"An old piece of Affordable Care Act mythology has come back from the dead: death panels.""According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution.""Following a hearing by the president’s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death. The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful.""Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure."" ‘Unfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,’ claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. ‘Under the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling.

PANTS-FIRE,Ad in Colorado Senate race suggests Cory Gardner would ban condoms,"Even amid a torrent of campaign ads during the waning days of the 2014 midterm election cycle, a new television ad in Colorado’s tight Senate race certainly stands out.It addresses a topic -- abortion and birth control -- that have recurred often in the campaign between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. But the imagery, and the claim, make the ad unusual.The ad’s sponsors -- the abortion-rights groups NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado -- frame the ad as an ""edgy"" attempt to reach young voters. (The ad also makes claims about climate change, but we won’t address those in this fact-check.)How accurate is the claim about condoms? We have previously addressed claims on Gardner and birth control, but this one is slightly different, so we’ll take a closer look.First, here’s what the Gardner campaign said when we asked about the ad.""Cory does not want to ban condoms,"" said campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano. ""In fact, he believes in increased access to contraceptives. He has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter.""So where does the ad get its evidence from?Past claims about Gardner and birth control have stemmed from his support of efforts to support ""personhood"" measures that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution.It goes on to say that "" 'human person' and 'human being' include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.""Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives.Gardner’s critics may have a point that some forms of birth control could be outlawed if personhood measures became law -- but that shouldn’t affect condoms. That’s because condoms prevent sperm from reaching the egg in the first place. No fertilization ever takes place.The ad’s sponsors didn’t get back to PolitiFact, but Doug Gordon, a spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, told our friends at FactCheck.org that ""we're not saying he is banning condoms. We are saying if Gardner starts limiting other forms of birth control, you better stock up on condoms because there will be so much demand for them — since Gardner wants to ban other forms of birth control.""Our rulingThe ad claims that ""if Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms.""The most obvious interpretation of this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms -- something that’s based on an incorrect interpretation of the measures Gardner has supported in the past (and which he has since distanced himself from). Gardner says he doesn’t support banning condoms, and in any case, condoms would not be at issue under the personhood measure he once supported. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Five years on, chain email about cancer treatment rationing after age 76 is still Pants on Fire","The email -- which has changed somewhat as it has zigzagged around social media -- can be identified by its attribution of the information to Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. (More on him later.) It opens with a dire warning:""MEDICARE AT AGE 76, IMPORTANT PLEASE READ - ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THIS IS TRUE CAN DOWNLOAD THE NEW OBAMA CARE AND LOOK UP THE PAGES MENTIONED. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING......THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75..... If you are younger, then it may apply to your parents….""Here, we'll recap what we know about the cancer claim and a few of the email's other points.The cancer claimThe email bases its claim about the age-based rationing of cancer care on page 272 of H.R. 3200, section 1145. But the claim is not correct.Meanwhile, the email raises a legitimate concern -- ""rationing"" -- but does so in a misleading way.It’s theoretically possible to spend an unlimited amount on health care, but as a society, we only have a limited amount of public resources -- so tough decisions have to be made on how to allocate those resources.Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, ""rationing"" occurred when private insurers denied coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, or denied reimbursement for certain basic services, or priced their plans too high for certain consumers to pay.If anything, John F. Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, said in an earlier interview that private insurers are historically more likely to deny health services than Medicare is. ""That's the argument you hear people making,"" he said. ""But I think they have it backwards.""A final word. Remember Judge Kithil, the supposed author of the email? He’s disowned it.""I wish it would die. I can’t control it,"" David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon in 2013. ""I don’t know how something like that goes viral.""Kithil said he wants readers to disregard his letter, since it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law.""I’ve had calls from all over the country -- 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this,"" he said at the time. He said he pleads with the callers, ""Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it.""Our rulingThe chain email says that the Affordable Care Act requires that, ""at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age.""With this email, longevity has not meant accuracy: Seniors do not need to worry about their cancer care being yanked away once they reach age 76. The claims are based on an incorrect understanding of a bill that never passed. The Affordable Care Act does not include any sections on seniors losing their treatment eligibility once they reach age 76.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,David Dewhurst says prayer rugs found in Texas brush near Mexico border,"For starters, scholars and Muslim religious figures we reached for this story warned against linking Muslim prayer to a person’s interest in terrorism. In themselves, experts said, the rugs -- like the ones pictured below in a photo emailed to us by Anees Siddiqui of Austin -- represent cleanliness; they’re placed on the ground where a Muslim believer prays. Also, the experts said, the rugs are not used by all the world’s estimated 1.6 billion Muslims.Courtesy photo: Anees Siddiqui, spokesman, the Islamic Center of Greater Austin.Dewhurst’s basisTo our inquiry, Andrew Barlow, a state spokesman for Dewhurst, who lost his re-election bid this spring, emailed us two URLs and said, ""Lt. Governor Dewhurst based his statement on this report: ...and this article.""Otherwise, he warned, government agencies would not admit prayer rug discoveries to the press.He said officials in President Barack Obama’s administration forbid the Border Patrol from speaking about anything that ""goes against the administration’s border security narrative.""Bardella said: ""The source stands by his statement.""Other accounts and authoritiesVia the Nexis news database, we spotted news reports of prayer rugs found along the border as long ago as 2005. None of the reports presented on-the-record sourced-by-name evidence.Separately, federal and local law enforcement authorities denied receiving reports of found prayer rugs while Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, emailed us that the agency doesn’t track that information.By phone, Joe Gutierrez Jr., spokesman for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector, said he had heard ""nothing"" about prayer rug finds.Gutierrez said he passed our query on to all Texas Border Patrol sectors by email. A response came from Rod Kise, a public information officer at the Rio Grande Valley Sector headquarters in Edinburg. Kise emailed: ""Regarding the discovery of prayer rugs along the Texas-Mexico Border, we had no reports of prayer rugs being found."" Kise also said: ""It is not unusual to find trash/etc. along smuggling routes.""To our inquiry, Brenda Medina-Moreno, a Laredo spokeswoman for the Webb County sheriff’s office, said by email: ""The Webb County Sheriff’s Office has not come across any prayer rugs and/or reports of the rugs along our border crossings.""Experts: Photograph not a prayer rugThe July 9, 2014, news story was written for Breitbart.com by Picket, who also wrote the story on prayer rugs found by ranchers near Laredo, Texas that Dewhurst relied on.To get our own sense of the photo’s accuracy, we sent a copy of the photograph and a request for analysis to over a dozen U.S. religious figures and scholars. We received  eight replies, with all the respondents saying the pictured item did not look like a prayer rug.Frank Griffel, chairman of the Council of Middle East Studies at Yale University, said: ""Is this a joke? What makes people think that the vague cloth at the border is a prayer rug? I can't see any connection. It's an old piece of cloth and it has no resemblance to a rug, even less so to a prayer rug.""Samer Ali, associate professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, said it didn’t look like a prayer rug because it was too thin, had seams, had hems and didn’t look like any design he’d seen on a prayer rug.Mustafa Umar, director of education and outreach at the Islamic Institute of Orange County in California, said: ""The checkered pattern is not characteristic of a prayer rug and was in fact discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad to use because that pattern distracts the Muslim from prayer.""Our rulingDewhurst said ""prayer rugs have recently been found"" in brush on the Texas side of the U.S.-Mexico border.This claim is weakened because it’s not backed up by sourced-by-name witnesses nor did any authority confirm such a find when we inquired. If prayer rugs were showing up to someone’s alarm, we think there'd be legitimate photographs and the rugs themselves available for inspection.Another hole: While people of the Muslim faith surely cross the Mexico-Texas border – that’s not at issue in this fact check – it’s unreasonable to presume the presence of prayer rugs means individuals carrying them intend to commit violent acts on U.S.soil, an implication of Dewhurst’s declaration.In the end, we find his statement incorrect and ridiculous. Rugs (we mean Pants) on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Providence firefighters’ union says Elorza wants to teach public school children God does not exist,"""Extremist."" That’s one of the ways the Providence firefighters union describes Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza in a recent mailing to city residents.The mailer was sent out in early October 2014, by Local 799 of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Elorza’s opponent, Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr., in the race for mayor.The third? ""Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the ‘non-existence of God,’"" the piece said.The article defines four views of God: the atheist view in which God does not exist; the deist view, which holds that God created the universe but has no influence on daily events; the theist view, which holds that God is not only the creator but also an intervenor in the world’s affairs; and what Elorza calls the ""memist"" view in which God lays down a moral code but ""resides entirely in the minds of its adherents.""Elorza focuses on the theist view, arguing that it violates the laws of physics. Science, he says, proves that the theist God does not exist. And U.S. courts have generally ruled that something can be taught in the public schools that may contradict a religious belief if science supports it. Evolution is one example that Elorza gives.As for the three other views of God, Elorza makes it clear that their existence cannot be proven one way or another. Thus, no argument can be made to support teaching that they do not exist, and doing so would violate the Constitution, according to Elorza.So what is his answer to the question that he posed at the beginning of the article?""I conclude, first, that teaching that the theist God does not exist would not violate any of the underlying values and second, that the consequences of doing so are not as far-reaching as may be initially believed,"" Elorza wrote.Elorza may have concluded, in his lengthy academic paper, that it is legally defensible to teach the non-existence of one particular aspect of God, but nowhere in the article does he say that he wants schools to teach it.In fact, he said just the opposite during a WPRI-12 debate in August, when asked by reporter Ted Nesi about the law review article.""I don’t seek to have this be taught in the public schools,"" Elorza said. ""This is a hypothetical that I laid out over 60 pages in an academic article.""""And it’s not something that you would seek to implement in the Providence schools?"" Nesi asked.Derek Silva, secretary of the firefighters’ union, told us that Elorza is now trying to distance himself from the article.When we contacted Elorza’s campaign, his spokesman, David Ortiz, defended the candidate.""Jorge was raised Christian,"" Ortiz said in an email. ""He believes in God. He does not want to teach atheism in schools, and has never made that suggestion anywhere.""Our rulingThe Providence firefighters union says that Jorge Elorza is an extremist who wants public schools to teach that God does not exist.But their only evidence is a misreading of a 2010 academic article Elorza wrote. Nowhere in the 54-page article does Elorza say he wants public schools to teach that there is no God.Elorza has said repeatedly that’s not his view and we could find no public statements by him that suggest otherwise.This is an inflammatory claim that has no basis in fact.It’s a good thing the firefighters union has experience dealing with flames, because we rule this claim Pants on Fire."

This wasn’t something anybody wanted to oppose.""Rapists walking free?Camp said that after the budget took effect in September 2013, DPS proceeded to bid out the tests of the kits to private laboratories which, Camp said, started working through kits in fall 2014. Camp said it makes sense that some of the resulting DNA ""hits,"" to be passed along by DPS to local police departments, will lead to individuals being convicted of assaults -- and be taken off the streets. For now,"" she said, ""we’re just not far enough into the process to know we’re going to take sexual offenders off the streets. But my guess is we will.""By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said that effective June 2014, the agency had an agreement for the University of North Texas Health Science Center to test about 1,000 kits. Also, Vinger said, the department has contracted with companies in Dallas and Virginia to test the kits. ""In the coming months, we will ultimately direct agencies where to send their kits,"" he said. ""The actual testing is expected to take place over two years.""Vinger said DPS doesn’t track successful prosecutions related to sexual assault testing  — whether via kits or other evidence.   Vinger also said ""backlog"" is misleading in reference to the kits now being tested since most of them hadn’t previously been submitted to a crime lab for testing, based on decisions by local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, he said.By email, we pointed out to Van de Putte that Patrick evidently played a role in initially putting the money for testing the kits into the budget and there is no indication his vote against the full final budget allowed rapists to walk. Garcia, stressing Patrick’s opposition to the final budget, emailed: ""If it was up to him alone, the budget would not have passed at that point in time, Meaning that testing for the rape kits would not be funded.""Our rulingVan de Putte said Patrick voted ""against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free.""This claim is flawed in various ways -- starting with blaming Patrick for a result that didn’t come to be. In reality, Patrick appears to have been among senators to initially put the kit-test funding into the state budget. And while he voted against the final overall budget, there’s no indication he did so to stop the kits from being tested. Also, the contention that rapists walked free as a result of Patrick’s action is incorrect. The funding (to repeat) passed into law.When a statement is incorrect and ridiculous, the Truth-O-Meter warms up in a hurry. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Viral claim says IRS will be delaying tax refunds next year, but it's fake news","Readers recently forwarded us a claim they had begun seeing in their inbox -- and which their friends were believing. It was a link to a story headlined, ""2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015.""This would be a pretty big deal if true. Is it?The short answer is: No.""Normally when you file your taxes, whatever money is owed back to you is quickly repaid. The process of getting your money back has been made even quicker in recent years through the use of E-file and direct deposit of federal tax rebates. But starting in 2015, federal tax refunds for the 2014 fiscal year are going to take longer for Americans to receive. A lot longer.""The deadline to have your federal taxes filed will remain April 15th, but under new directives issued to the IRS, no refunds are to be issued before October 15th, 2015. This means that early filers who normally receive their refunds around the beginning of February will have to wait an additional 7 months longer than normal to get the money owed to them.""White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended the upcoming changes to IRS tax refund policy. 'It’s a minor cost saving measure initiated by the administration with bipartisan support,' said Earnest. 'The recommendation to initiate this new refund structure came out of the Committee On Ways And Means, under the leadership of Republican Congressman David Camp. Absolutely zero dollars are going to be kept that is owed to hardworking Americans. All you are seeing here is a policy change streamlining the way in which the IRS structures tax refund repayments. Americans who find this objectionable can always opt to bring their tax withholding more in line with the actual taxes they will owe in the future.' ""The article went on to quote two Republican senators critical of the move -- Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona.There is one problem with the claim: It comes from a fake-news site.The last time we checked a bogus claim from National Report, the site had a disclaimer that said ""the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report.""

PANTS-FIRE,Trump: Obama's New York fundraising trip cost 'between $25 million and $50 million',"We reached out to Trump to learn where he got his numbers and didn’t hear back. But we wondered, would a one-day New York trip cost between ""$25 million and $50 million""?Note: Under the rules of presidential travel, when the purpose of a trip is political, not official, the president’s political organization reimburses the government. For airfare, the price is based on the cost of a commercial ticket for the president and all those who accompany him. In this case, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would be on the hook.TripTotal daysDaily cost (2014 dollars)Africa - six nations12$5.1 million/dayChile5$3 million/dayChina9$3 million/dayWhile we can’t know all the details of Obama’s New York jaunt, there is no evidence that it approached the complexity of either of the lower cost trips in the GAO report.And if those trips halfway around the world came in at about $3 million per day (in today’s dollars), it is extremely likely that a back-and-forth to New York would cost less. Much less.Bottom line: Presidential travel is expensive, but Trump’s estimate of Obama’s fundraising trip to New York is wildly high, based on everything we know.Our rulingTrump said Obama’s recent New York fundraising trip cost between $25 million and $50 million. Trump provided no evidence, likely because all the available information points to a total that would be way, way lower than $25 million, let alone $50 million.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Pants on Fire: Duncan Hunter makes unconfirmed claim Border Patrol caught at least 10 ISIS fighters,"U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.No federal or state confirmationNo state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources.And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense.""It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of ""no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case.""Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.Our rulingHunter said ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"" and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"" is missing a factual basis.All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

""According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that’s just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened.""Now, we examine whether something called ""the Disaster Assistance Response Team"" was told to get ready for an outbreak of Ebola.""A large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in ‘high risk events’ says that Disaster Assistance Response Teams were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October. The shocking revelation, made on the Golden State FIRE EMS Twitter page, suggests that not only did someone know that the Ebola virus would be reaching America, but that they knew exactly when it would happen.""The tweets are authentic.What’s lacking is anything of substance behind them.We spoke to Ed Castillo, president of Golden State FIRE EMS. Castillo was regretful.""A couple of EMS guys were talking about conspiracy theories,"" Castillo said. ""There are no facts to support it.

""We had to tear down our Twitter account. Now we’re just sticking to Facebook and our Web page. We just want to get back to work.""The Golden State tweets might have been vacuous blather taken as reality, but the Global Research and Brittany posts went beyond even what the tweets said. Their reference to a ""large government supplier of emergency response products"" seems to have greatly reimagined Golden State’s line of work.To write about ""the Disaster Assistance Response Team"" as a singular entity also seems odd. Such a name applies generically to any group that jumps in to help in a disaster.Brittany doesn’t write definitively that these theories are accurate but closed her article on a note of fear.""Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over.""Our rulingBrittany passed along as fact that a government supplier knew that emergency responders had been told well in advance to get ready for Ebola.

PANTS-FIRE,Democrats accuse Southerland of seeking 'health care for life',"Gwen Graham and U.S. Rep Steve Southerland are getting some help from their respective national parties in their hotly contested Panhandle Congressional district race.To bolster Graham, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is using a new commercial to revive an old attack.Let’s see how this claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter.Law of the landThis gets a little complicated, so bear with us.The flap stems from the fact that Congress has to abide by the terms of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law as much as you do.Back in 2010, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa attached an amendment to the law requiring members of Congress to obtain health insurance through the exchanges touted by the bill. Before that, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government.This is much like the way it works for anyone with an employee-sponsored group plan -- in this case, it’s just that their employer is the U.S. government.Using that for proof is dubious, as the Democrats are basically citing one of their own anonymously as a source. They are essentially laundering a Democratic talking point through a nonpartisan newspaper.So let’s say Obamacare was magically legislated away and the old congressional system returns. Here’s the problem with the claim: Lawmakers and their aides don’t get to use the federal health plan forever.Meanwhile, in the real world, if a member of Congress is buying an insurance plan off an exchange, that coverage is subject to the same terms as anyone else’s policy. Again, if they don’t pay the premium, they don’t have coverage. That’s hardly guaranteeing any lawmaker lifetime health insurance.Our rulingThe DCCC says Southerland ""voted himself health care for life.""This is a campaign tactic the Democrats have used before, referring to how members of Congress would get to fall back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program should Obamacare be repealed and its insurance marketplaces be shuttered.This federal program doesn’t last for life, but only as long as a member of Congress or an aide works for the federal government. It also switches over to Medicare when a lawmaker still in office turns 65.We rate this claim Pants On Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,'New York Post' op-ed rebuts starving children claim that was never made,"The ads, writes Huber, ""inform us of a horror we’d otherwise think impossible: America has so failed its children that 17 million — one in five — don’t have enough to eat. Except that, enjoyable as all this self-loathing might seem, it’s simply a fairy tale.""""The only basis for Feeding America’s claim comes from U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys in which heads of households were asked if at any time during a calendar year their children were a) unable to eat what they wanted; b) unable to eat in whatever quantity they wanted; c) forced to eat cheaper brands, or d) afraid their food supply might run out on any single day.""In this fact-check, we focus on Huber’s statement that Feeding America misled the public when it said that ""one in five kids is fighting starvation daily.""As it turns out, we can find no evidence that Feeding America ever made that claim. We asked Huber, and he backed away from it.""The words they use about going to bed hungry seems to me to be starving,"" Huber said. ""I applied that word to their language.""""We say ‘facing hunger,’ or ‘at risk of hunger,’ or ‘on the precipice of hunger,’ "" Fraser said. ""Because the federal government’s data is not about hunger. It’s about food insecurity.""We’ll get into the federal data in just a bit, but beyond denying that Feeding America speaks of starvation, Fraser also denied that his group ever used the line about kids going to bed hungry.""We don’t have any public service announcements that use that,"" Fraser said.Ellyn Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Ad Council, the corporate-backed nonprofit that distributes the announcements, was equally emphatic.""I have confirmed that we have never used the line you are referring to in a PSA,"" Fisher said.Huber also named two celebrity spokeswomen for Feeding America, Paula Deen and Beyonce, that the organization said had not been part of its public service efforts. Huber later told us that Deen had done some work for New York food banks, but that, ""strictly speaking I don't know if she had an audio PSA.""Further, Huber acknowledged that in order to shorten the piece, he paraphrased the questions he drew from the Agriculture Department’s survey. Here are the actual statements and questions put to families:Number of children facing hungerTo the casual reader, Feeding America’s claim that one in five children faces hunger might sound as though one in five kids actually goes hungry. The organization provides a more nuanced view on its website, and we wanted to lay out the numbers here. The summaries all go back to those USDA questions.The government uses the less severe category, ""low food security,"" for children who live in families where, at the very least, a lack of money meant the kids couldn’t get a balanced meal during the last 12 months.The number of children in that group, plus the very low security group, is about 8.5 million, or about 11.7 percent of all children.The most commonly heard statistic, that one in five children live in food insecure households, refers to the 15.7 million kids that live in families in which, at the very least, anyone in the household of any age couldn’t afford a balanced meal at some point during the year. This includes adults and children.Deborah Frank, a pediatrician at the Boston University School of Medicine and member of the National Commission on Hunger, said many studies show that simply living in a low food security household is enough to undercut a child’s well being.""The hurt can be lasting, Frank said. ""If it cuts into how much kids learn, if it makes them less healthy, and how healthy a baby they have, these are all ways that children are hurt by not having enough of the right kinds of food.""Frank and Feeding America noted that the problem in America is less about children having enough calories, and more about the nutritional quality of the food they eat.Our rulingHuber said that Feeding America was lying when it said kids were starving in America. Huber acknowledged that ""starving"" was his word, not the nonprofit’s. The sentence about children ""going to bed hungry"" was essential to Huber’s argument, but we could find no evidence that Feeding America ever used that phrase. Feeding America also denied using that phrase.One of the principles of PunditFact is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. Huber has none.As such, we rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Scary NRA ad claims Mary Landrieu voted to take away gun rights,"The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun lobbying group, is targeting a handful of Democrats in close Senate races with one of the most provocative — if not downright scary —  ads of the campaign season.""Love you. Good night,"" she texts back.Suddenly, an ominous shadow is outside a window and a figure busts into the front door. Cut to a scene with police tape outside the home, suggesting tragedy.""It happens like that,"" a narrator says. ""The police can’t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It’s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights.""How do we get from a vote in Congress to an intruder barreling through a poor woman’s front door? It’s far from a straight line.The NRA’s first justificationThe Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its harshest rating.The NRA’s second justification""Landrieu voted to confirm at least one anti-gun and anti-self defense (Supreme Court) justice,"" said NRA spokesman Arulanandam. ""Anti-self defense is life or death.""During Sotomayor’s nomination proceedings, her past ruling on a Second Amendment issue became a talking point for Republicans who were critical of President Barack Obama’s choice.Sotomayor was part of a majority opinion that ruled the New York statute legal. The Second Amendment applies to federal laws but not state laws, they wrote, citing an 1886 Supreme Court decision.No other major gun issues have come before the Supreme Court during Sotomayor’s time. In fact, it has turned down requests to review the right to have a handgun outside the home, said Amy Howe, editor of the popular Supreme Court analysis website SCOTUSblog.Problems with the second justificationSo how convincing is the Sotomayor argument? It has some considerable holes.For starters, it’s a slippery slope to claim that a vote for a Supreme Court justice is a vote ""to take away your gun rights.""To use the same logic, was a vote to confirm President George W. Bush’s nomination of John Roberts also a vote for the Affordable Care Act just because he ruled to uphold the individual mandate? Was a vote for Justice Anthony Kennedy — the justice appointed by President Ronald Reagan who became the swing vote in the case that effectively ended California’s same-sex marriage ban — a vote to legalize same-sex marriage?In other words, no one can tell in advance how justices will eventually vote on issues that come before the court. Justices appointed by Republicans can surprise and take what would be considered the liberal position in a case, and vice versa.As for Landrieu, her campaign said she has supported pro-gun measures over the years, including a proposal that requires states to recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states. She also voted against an assault weapons ban supported by the White House in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The NRA also opposed the measure.Our rulingThe NRA ad claims, ""Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights."" This is quite a leap in logic.After initially staking its claim to a background check bill that didn’t pass Congress — nor did it ""take away your gun rights,"" leaving women defenseless in their homes — the group now pins its claim on Landrieu’s vote to confirm Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. But that’s questionable, since there is no way to know in advance how a justice will vote. And the NRA has endorsed two other senators, Graham and Alexander, who cast exactly the same vote. Meanwhile, on the other major gun vote of this term, a key assault-weapons ban, Landrieu voted the NRA’s position.Given all this, to run an ad as scary as this one can only be described as fear mongering. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Perdue fails in attempt to tar Nunn for terrorist link,"With Election Day just about five weeks away, and polls consistently showing a tight race with national implications, the battle to become Georgia’s next U.S. senator has turned ugly.In a newly released television ad that carries echoes of the late-campaign attacks that pundits said worked during the GOP runoff, Republican candidate David Perdue goes after Democrat Michelle Nunn for a supposed weakness on border security.Before he gets to that though, a narrator opens with a simple statement: ""Michelle Nunn’s own plan says she funded organizations linked to terrorists.""If that wasn’t clear enough, an overlay in all capital writing spells out what it calls an ""exact quote"" from a Nunn campaign document: ""awards to inmates, terrorists.""A simple sentence but serious implications. Is the ad right, that Michelle Nunn admits to financial ties to terrorists?The conservative National Review revealed in July that it had a 144-page series of Nunn campaign memos from last December. The story broke about a week after Perdue won the Republican nomination, in part by attacking rival U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston as ""pro-amnesty"" and in the pocket of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The leaked memos lay out Nunn's campaign strategy and include, among other things, detailed fundraising plans, a public relations strategy and list of anticipated attacks in the race.In those anticipated attacks and vulnerabilities is the reference to ""service awards to inmates, terrorists"" during her Points of Light tenure.The plan called for her team to have ""pushback"" documents ready for those anticipated issues as well as common, more broad attacks leveled against Democratic candidates.That means Nunn’s camp correctly predicted the GOP would attack her on the issue, not that there is a connection to be made.""This isn’t something that we pulled out of thin air,"" Dickey said.One of those charities, Islamic Relief USA, received about $13,500 in donations from MissionFish, and has partnered with the umbrella group Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) on disaster relief programs.A top Israeli defense official has accused IRW of having links to the terrorist group Hamas, and in June, the defense minister banned it from operating there.In 2012, one British bank closed an IRW account over counter-terrorism concerns. But the U.S. State Department does not consider the group a terrorist organization or front.Islamic Relief USA, meanwhile, earns a perfect score from Charity Navigator for its transparency and accounting. The group does give grants to IRW for humanitarian programs in developing countries, as it does with other groups, said advocacy counsel Sharif Aly.But it also works with the American Red Cross and other charities in disaster relief, such as an ongoing effort to help with flooding in the Detroit area.""We are not terrorists and we do not support terrorism,"" Aly said. ""Any money disbursed, inside or outside the United States, follows all regulations to ensure that.""Nunn declined to be drawn into the debate this summer, when the memo was first unveiled. She did tell the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the memos, including the anticipated attacks, were more advice from supporters than a strict campaign blueprint.Nunn spokesman Nathan Click told PolitiFact Georgia that of course Nunn ""absolutely"" did not support terrorism or have any connections to terrorists.""That is not what the memo says,"" Click said. ""It anticipates attacks that mischaracterize her record and distort her experience. That’s exactly what has happened.""So where does that leave us with an attack that states as fact that Michelle Nunn’s own internal documents says she funded organizations that have terrorist ties?The Perdue ad plainly misconstrues what the Nunn internal memos said and why. PolitiFact Georgia has already ruled that tying Nunn’s nonprofit work to terrorism is off base.The effort to make the connection by incorrectly citing her campaign’s leaked memos verges on the ridiculous.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Wendy Davis catches fire with incorrect claim about Greg Abbott, incest and rape","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis, who has been pressing Republican candidate Greg Abbott to say if he opposes abortion in all circumstances, told reporters Abbott should disavow a supporter’s comment about rape and incest.Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, was asked if Abbott should be accountable for a comment by someone who doesn’t work for him. She replied that Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, whose comments she was questioning, has ""been a surrogate voice for Greg Abbott and the Greg Abbott campaign. And I think that most telling is the fact that Greg Abbott has not come forward  to disavow Matt Mackowiak’s characterization of women who have been victimized by rape and in cases of incest as though somehow they’ve suffered a minor issue.""""Absolutely,"" Angle replied, saying Abbott made it clear he plans to continue defending the state against school districts who say the funding system is unconstitutional. ""And also,"" Angle said, ""he again defended his position, his extreme position, that even in cases where women are victims of rape or incest that he would impose himself and others like him in the government to decide what they do with that pregnancy.""Next, Jeffers asked Mackowiak if abortion remains a tough issue for Davis in conservative-leaning Texas.Mackowiak replied: ""It is, that’s right. Wendy Davis didn’t use the word ‘abortion’ in her announcement speech when she announced for that office and that’s for that reason. Look, Wendy Davis filibustered a bill that would have outlawed, that did outlaw, late-term abortion after five months. That is the law of the land. Texas is a pro-life state.""We can get into minor issues that are 1 percent or 2 percent of the problem. But ultimately, Texas is a strongly pro-life state. Abbott would love to fight this campaign on that issue alone from here on out, but Wendy knows that that’s not strategically wise.Angle: ""That’s the first time I’ve heard rape or incest called a minor issue.""Mackowiak: ""It’s minor in terms of the percentage of the cases, that’s all I’m saying.""Angle: ""A victim of rape and incest is not a minor problem.""Mackowiak (nodding his head): ""OK. All right. Great. Right.""The day after Davis made this claim, Mackowiak emailed us a statement saying he’s not an Abbott surrogate and had never claimed to be.""I do not believe rape or incest is a minor issue and never said that,"" he told us. ""For any victim of rape or incest, that brutal crime is a major and life-changing issue and the crime deserves to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Rather, I said that rape and incest are a small percentage of abortions.""Abbott campaign spokeswoman Amelia Chasse told us by email that Mackowiak hasn’t been employed or paid by Abbott’s campaign.By email to our queries, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said: ""Any Republican who goes on television to do post-debate spin, uses their talking points and defends their positions is an Abbott surrogate."" Petkanas said he was not aware of other Abbott surrogates making the rape-incest claim described by Davis.Our rulingDavis said Abbott and his surrogates ""have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue.""Davis got this wrong various ways given that the individual in question, a Republican consultant who doesn’t work for Abbott, immediately clarified on the air he was saying few abortions occur after incidents of rape or incest. Also on the air, Mackowiak agreed with the Democrat criticizing him that rapes and incest aren’t minor things. Davis’ camp also identified no other people who declared incest and rapes to be minor things nor is there evidence Abbott said anything of the sort.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Bill Cassidy says Mary Landrieu 'put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans',"Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican running for Senate in Louisiana, mixed two buzzwords of the 2014 campaign cycle — immigrants and veterans — in an ad attacking Democratic opponent Sen. Mary Landrieu.How are the two related? Cassidy said Landrieu chose to fund one but cut from the other.""What would you choose? To fund benefits for veterans or for illegal immigrants? I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did,"" Cassidy said in the ad. ""Instead of fully funding veterans’ benefits, she voted to give benefits to those here illegally. No wonder she supports Barack Obama and his amnesty plan.""That’s quite the charge, but is it accurate? We decided to take a look.Cassidy is referring to the budget agreement reached in December 2013 between Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. — the top budget negotiators for their respective chambers.Under the agreement, budget caps for discretionary spending are set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, that figure is $45 billion more than it would have been under sequestration, and it’s $18 billion more for 2015.How did Congress pay for that? In part, by reducing the cost-of-living adjustments for the retirement pay of veterans under the age of 62.That provision sparked immediate blowback from veterans groups and some members of Congress.When the bill moved to the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blocked any amendments so the fragile agreement could get an up-or-down vote as it passed the House (another government shutdown was looming in January).But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried to reopen the amendment process so he could introduce an amendment that would have restored the pension cost-of-living reduction for veterans. To pay for increased spending caps, Sessions wanted to instead close a loophole that allowed some undocumented immigrants with children to collect the Additional Child Tax Credit.Cassidy spokesman John Cummins said Landrieu in the Senate could have voted to open the budget agreement to amendments and chose not to. Cassidy did not have that opportunity in the House because Republican leadership pushed it through under structured rule, meaning no amendments were allowed. (For what it's worth, we didn't see any statements from Cassidy lamenting this.)Even if we agreed with this line of reasoning — which we don’t — it doesn’t absolve Cassidy from voting for, and defending, the same reductions to veterans benefits.Ingraham: ""You supported this budget deal and now we find out that military folks who have sacrificed so much are being asked yet again to sacrifice — this in terms of their pensions — and yet we can’t seem to close loopholes for welfare benefits going to illegal aliens and yet you supported this. Why?""Cassidy: ""There are no benefit cuts to people who are retiring, there is an adjustment to their cost of living, which starts off not for all, but those who retire before age 62.""Cassidy went on to further defend the cut to military pensions as logical reforms without really touching on the second aspect of Ingraham’s question about tax credits for undocumented immigrants.Finally, the House and Senate voted to restore those cuts to veterans benefits the following February. Under the restructured agreement, anyone who signed up for military service before 2014 would not see a change to their benefits. Both Cassidy and Landrieu voted for this, and Obama signed it into law on Feb. 15.Our rulingCassidy said, ""I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did."" There are several problems with this statement. First is the false dichotomy that Landrieu had a choice between funding undocumented immigrants and veterans in the budget agreement. That amendment never actually came up for a vote.But even putting that aside, Cassidy suggests that his position is vastly different than Landrieu. In fact, they both voted in favor of the same budget agreement to reduce future cost-of-living adjustments for veterans benefits (they both also voted to restore them), with Cassidy going on conservative radio to defend these cuts.Cassidy ignores his own record to inaccurately criticize Landrieu’s.

Answer to Facebook meme is none of the above,"Whose pants are the most on fire: the NBA, the NFL, Congress or Facebook memes?The meme struck us as suspect right off the bat.It says, of Congress’ 535 members:So we’re going to debunk it again.We don’t dispute that some lawmakers are involved in nefarious activities. Take, for example, former Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fla., who resigned earlier this year after he was caught buying cocaine from a federal agent.There’s no comprehensive database about all congressional crime and generally unsavory behavior, so we can’t come up with the real numbers on our own. But we know enough about where the meme originated to say that these statistics can’t be trusted.Keep in mind that if these statistics were true -- and we’re reasonably certain they’re not -- they’re 15 years old. Only 100 members of the current Congress were in office in 1999, when Capitol Hill Blue published the stories.The Capitol Hill Blue articles say the authors’ research revealed each one of the statistics listed above, though sometimes with slightly different wording. (With one exception: the article says 29 members have been accused of spousal abuse, rather than 36.)The authors mention ""public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records,"" but do not quote specific documents. They also say plainly of some of their sources, ""We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends."" So these sources possibly had an agenda in talking to Capitol Hill Blue.We can’t even check which members of Congress Capitol Hill Blue is talking about. The article says, ""We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse.""All of this makes it difficult to take these allegations seriously.We reached out to Capitol Hill Blue for comment but haven’t heard back.Our rulingA Facebook meme says Congress includes 36 people accused of spousal abuse, 84 arrested for drunk driving in the past year, 71 with terrible credit and more.These accusations appear to be fabricated. The statistics come from an article written 15 years ago, and the original source, Capitol Hill Blue, has removed the original article from its website. Congress’ record isn’t blemish-free, by any means, but these statistics have no basis in fact. We rate this meme Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Was Martha Kanter 'dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million' to save Craig Robinson's job?,"""Thank Goodness For The Stimulus!!!"" trumpets the anonymous email, which first popped up in March 2010. ""But $17 million for one job? I wonder what mine is worth?""The claim:It notes the first family connections and closes: ""If this doesn’t anger you, nothing will … remember to vote this fall!!!!""The analysis:The crux of the claim involves the charge that Bob DeCarolis, Oregon State’s athletic director, was preparing to fire Robinson after a ""dismal 8-11 start (2-5) in the Pac 10 Conference.""The university changed its mind, supposedly, only after Kanter, formerly the Obama administration’s highest-ranking higher education official, was ""dispatched"" to Corvallis with oodles of stimulus money.We called Steve Clark, OSU’s vice president for university relations and marketing. ""It’s interesting that it comes up again now,"" he said, ""just a few months before the elections.""""As did public universities throughout the nation,"" Clark said. OSU’s share totaled $26.4 million. ""That funded 61 research projects and some infrastructure,"" he added, ""all associated with issues consistent with Oregon State’s research mission.""However, a problem of timing surfaces immediately.So that’s likely where the $17 million referred to in the chain email came from.But when OSU’s 2009-10 basketball season came along, that money was already gone. The Beavers didn’t get to two wins and five losses in league play -- the point at which DeCarolis, according to the email, was mulling firing Robinson -- until their Jan. 23, 2010, road loss to California.""I have no idea where this rumor stems from,"" she wrote. ""I never traveled to Corvallis to award $17 million in stimulus money in 2010, nor do I personally know Craig Robinson."" She also provided a link to another fact-checking site that debunked the claim.OSU officials said they have no record of Kanter showing up in Corvallis around that time, nor is there any evidence of news stories detailing a trip.DeCarolis has flatly denied the story several times. It would also be highly unusual for any major college program to fire a coach so early in a season, especially considering that Robinson’s team the year before finished with an 18-18 win-loss record and earned OSU’s first post-season championship by winning the 2009 College Basketball Invitational.As for Robinson, the run didn’t last forever. DeCarolis fired him May 5, 2014, after six seasons and a win-loss record of 94-105.The ruling:A recycled chain email claims OSU basketball coach Craig Robinson -- Michelle Obama’s brother and the president’s brother-in-law -- avoided losing his job in March 2010 only because a high-ranking administration official was ""dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university.""Records show that OSU had spent $17.8 million in stimulus funds months before the point when Robinson’s job was supposedly on the line. And there is no evidence that an administration official was ""dispatched"" to Corvallis. The state, not the feds, also chose how to spend the money."
PANTS-FIRE,"In ad to promote Rick Scott, Rothstein investor says he was 'swindled' by Charlie Crist","The ad featured an unidentified man who said he was swindled by Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein -- and, by extension, by former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat and seeking to unseat Florida Gov. Rick Scott.""Scott Rothstein swindled a lot of people, me included,"" the unidentified narrator said. ""He bankrupted many families. Nobody was closer to Rothstein than Charlie Crist. Rothstein was always around Charlie, throwing parties and giving Charlie money. Rothstein bragged that he gave Charlie Crist money so he could pick judges. Of course Charlie took the money. I got swindled by both Rothstein and Charlie. If Charlie Crist will sell judgeships, everything is for sale.""The ad -- which has run at least 4,000 times at a cost of about $2 million -- includes photos of Rothstein and Crist embracing each other and blowing out the candles on Crist’s 52nd birthday cake. (Technical note: The ad was released by the state Republican Party, but it is on Scott’s behalf. Scott’s campaign has been defending it and he initially referred questions about the ad to his campaign. So that's why we're putting Scott on the Truth-O-Meter.)We decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter.The investor’s lawsuit didn’t mention CristThe lawsuit named several defendants, including Rothstein and TD Bank, the banker for Rothstein’s law firm. Crist’s name isn’t mentioned in the lawsuit.Unmentioned in the ad is that Kretschmar’s lawyer is William R. Scherer, a Scott donor.Kretschmar has given about $19,000 to state and federal GOP candidates and committees, including -- ironically -- $500 to Crist when he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006.Scott’s responseThe pro-Scott ad’s backup cites several articles about Rothstein’s court testimony earlier this year in a case involving a former employee of his law firm. Rothstein testified that he bought Crist’s judicial picks, but did not mention Kretschmar.""This individual was a victim of both Scott Rothstein and Charlie Crist. Both of them promised things, and they didn’t come through,"" Scott said. ""Charlie said he was a Ronald Reagan Republican. He was against tax increases. He was against raising your tuition. And he did both,"" Scott said, repeating variations of this argument when reporters sought clarification. ""Charlie was a Republican and then an independent then a Democrat.""Sellers also argued that ""no one ever said Crist was not part of the Rothstein investigation.""Rothstein was then asked by an attorney whether he ""fooled"" Crist or former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla.Our rulingA TV ad by Scott quotes a Rothstein victim who says that he was ""swindled"" by Crist, but that’s a gross distortion.Kretschmar was swindled by Rothstein, but the ad provides no evidence that he was ""swindled"" by Crist as well. Scott and his campaign argue that the comparison between the ""swindles"" by Rothstein and Crist is metaphorical, with Crist having ""swindled"" voters by changing his positions on political issues like same-sex marriage.However, the way the accusation was framed in the ad leaves viewers with the impression that Crist was part of Rothstein’s criminal Ponzi scheme -- he was not. The ad’s equation of the two is ridiculous, so we rate the claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Todd Staples airs smoky claim about children not getting protein unless they're served meat,"For Staples, excluding meat is not just a matter of taste – it’s a blow to daily nutrition, especially if students are not well nourished at home. ""It is important to remember that for many underprivileged children the meals they eat at school often represent their best meals of the day. To deprive them of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day,"" Staples wrote.Was Staples right about kids getting shorted? Let’s look at the meals that drew his ire, then explore if affected children are not getting needed proteins.Warning: Flames ahead.Dining options on a Meatless MondayGenerally in Dripping Springs, lunching students may select up to one meat/meat alternate, three fruit or vegetable dishes and one grain or milk dish. If a child forgoes a meat/meat alternate, he or she is allowed four fruit or vegetable dishes. A student must take a minimum of three dishes with at least one serving of fruit or vegetable. On any day, of course, there's a chance a child won't choose to eat any protein dishes.On the third Monday, the cafeteria offers black bean burritos, bean and cheese burritos, vegetarian chili, corn bread, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, ""healthy"" refried beans, ""carrot babies"" with ranch, chilled sliced peaches and fresh fruit. This is a Meatless Monday menu from Dripping Springs Elementary, as presented online by the school.Staples’ backup informationBlack said the website ""is dedicated to healthy lifestyles for children and confirms the message from Commissioner Staples"" that many students might not have access to protein at home.Non-meat proteins We sent an inquiry on the quality and quantity of proteins in non-meat foods to the Nutrition and Food Science Department at Texas A&M University, and our questions were referred to Dr. Peter Murano, who worked for several years as deputy administrator at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service.""It is certainly the case that meat foods, as well as dairy foods and eggs, are widely known to be the best sources of high quality, complete protein – which means that all of the essential amino acids that a child needs will be present, and in a highly digestible/utilizable form,"" he said in an email.""It is however recognized that by pairing incomplete protein plant-based foods, such as beans and rice, that each complements the other, and the combination is also a good source of protein,"" he said.Murano said some common pairings of incomplete proteins to make complete proteins include beans and rice, peanut butter and bread (wheat) and corn and lima beans.A complete protein includes all nine essential amino acids that the body uses to build flesh as well as hormones and enzymes. With incomplete protein sources, like unpaired beans, the body will not be able to make new material like hormones and flesh. However, Murano said that even on a vegetarian diet, one could have a healthy protein diet by consuming a complete protein or accurately paired incomplete proteins ""several times a week.""Federal standards for nutritious mealsThe guidelines also say: ""USDA wishes to clarify that schools have the option to offer mature beans and dry peas (e.g., kidney beans, pinto beans, black beans, garbanzo beans/ chickpeas, black-eyed peas, split peas and lentils) as meat alternates. Mature beans and peas dry longer on the plant, fix more nitrogen, and have a higher protein content, which makes them nutritionally comparable to protein foods.""Our rulingStaples wrote: ""To deprive"" underprivileged children ""of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day.""He offered no full-fledged backup for this claim while the Austin-area school he singled out as demonstrating this shortcoming follows a menu written to satisfy federal requirements schools serve a protein meeting dietary needs, whether it’s meat or not, every day.Fire up the smoker. This statement is Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Tom Cotton incorrectly says Obama turned farm bill into food stamps bill,"""(My dad) taught me early: farmers can’t spend more than they take in, and I listened,"" Cotton said in the ad. ""When President Obama hijacked the farm bill, turned it into a food stamp bill, with billions more in spending, I voted no.""Is this true? Is Obama really to blame? We took a closer look.A brief historyFood assistance legislation has been tied to agriculture for decades.Congress passed the first farm bill in 1933, during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, to aid farmers struggling with low commodity prices and dry soil in the Midwest. To fight poverty in the general population, the bill also established a nutritional assistance program. The program took surplus crops, meat and dairy products and distributed them to people in need.So how does this history illuminate the accuracy of Cotton’s claim?But the idea of merging the two topics together in one bill hardly came from Obama. It had been that way, uninterrupted, since 1973 -- when Obama wasn’t even a teenager yet.Our rulingCotton said that Obama ""hijacked the farm bill (and) turned it into a food stamp bill."" That’s not correct -- food stamps have been part of every farm bill enacted since 1973. One could say that Cotton and his allies in the House, by seeking a farm bill stripped of food stamp provisions, were actually the ones taking a more radical step, one that Congress ultimately voted against. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Mika Brzezinski repeats myth that Super Bowl Sunday has 'highest rate of domestic violence',"Two decades ago, a group of women’s rights advocates came out with a disturbing warning about professional football’s biggest day: Super Bowl Sunday is also the biggest day of the year for violence against women.But by then it was too late to correct the record.""You look at Super Bowl Sunday. Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence,"" she said Sept. 16. ""There’s something about the game!""Minutes later, she said, ""This is a violent game. And domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday. We've seen the numbers. Why is that?""The truth is that Super Bowl Sunday is not a unique day for domestic violence, says Callie Rennison, a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who studies domestic violence.""This is not to be confused with there being no violence or a lower amount of violence on Super Bowl Sunday,"" Rennison said. ""It happens on holidays, it happens on weekends, and it happens on weekdays.""Press coverage of the original news conference 20 years ago said a California Women’s Law Center official cited research to bolster her comments. The lawyer, Sheila Kuehl, was reported as citing an academic study that found a 40 percent uptick in police reports of beatings and hospital admissions after Washington Redskins victories between 1988-89.Katz said her ""tentative findings"" did not correlate an increase in ER admissions of women with football games in general or with men upset by a team loss.A spokeswoman for MSNBC did not offer comment by deadline.Our rulingIt’s no more true now than 20 years ago. Experts say this myth persists in spite of long-lasting academic rebuke.We rate it Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Are three detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl now ISIS leaders?,"A reader recently sent us a link to a rather startling claim -- that three of the five Guantanamo detainees released by the United States in late May in exchange for Taliban prisoner Bowe Bergdahl have now taken up arms for the Islamic State.That’s the militant group sometimes known as ISIS or ISIL that has taken control of portions of Iraq and Syria and has beheaded two American journalists and at least one other Westerner.""It is being reported that at least 3 of the 5 detainees involved in the swap have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq as commanders and are using that rank to usher in an 'Islamic Caliphate' (a Sunni Islamic Theocracy -- contrary to Obama's claims that ISIS is not Islamic).""The 'Taliban 5' who were transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to custody in Doha, Qatar, are Mohammad Fazl, Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Norullah Noori, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They have largely disappeared from view since they were dropped off in Doha, but eyewitnesses place Fazi, Wasiq, and Noori in Iraq and Syria fighting with ISIS.""If true, this would be a major story. But it’s not.We didn’t find any news reports about what the ex-detainees have been up to recently, but we quickly noticed a couple of red flags that made us suspicious of the email’s claims. For starters, the claim in politicalears.com is entirely unsourced.Experts who study the region told us the claim was wrong. The ex-detainees ""are all in Qatar. This is nonsense,"" said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation.Gartenstein-Ross added that the claim doesn’t even make much logical sense and betrays the author’s weak grasp on the region’s nuances.""The ex-detainees ""were in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""Based on these guys’ social networks and who their points of contact were, it’s pretty unlikely they’d be able to quickly find a way to the battlefield and have a command"" in the Iraq-Syria border region.""They are not native Arabic speakers, and it would be unfamiliar terrain culturally. They would face a lot of obstacles,"" he said.When we asked the White House if there was any evidence that one or more detainees has joined ISIS, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, ""There is no truth to these reports.""Our rulingBloggers said that ""three of five detainees swapped (for Bowe Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders."" The claim has nonexistent sourcing, has been published by sites with questionable track records for accuracy, and has been knocked down by independent experts. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Did Rick Scott close 30 women's health care centers'?,"Crist has also enlisted endorsements from Democratic women, such as U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach. Frankel recently penned a campaign fundraising email attacking Scott that was emailed out by the Crist campaign.This claim warranted a thorough check-up from the Truth-O-Meter -- and we quickly diagnosed the heart of the problem in Frankel’s words.Women’s health care centersWe reached out to both Frankel and the Crist campaign. Neither could provide evidence for closed health care centers.The Crist campaign admitted the statement was an error. ""That should have read ‘He cut funding to 30 rape crisis centers across the state,’ "" Crist campaign spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said.Frankel's spokeswoman Majda Sarkic sent us this response: ""The issue here is not about email wording. It is about Rick Scott denying Florida women and more specifically victims of sexual violence the healthcare they need and deserve.""So the statement that Scott closed 30 women’s health centers is completely wrong.We decided to then look at what happened to funding for rape crisis centers under Scott.Based on our interviews with women’s advocates and state officials, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide:Legislative sessionMoney from state AG (usually from general revenue)Other general revenueTrust Fund**2007-Crist$400,0000$1.5 million2008-Crist$400,000*0$2 million2009-Crist$250,0000$2 million2010-Crist$250,0000$1.8 million2011-Scott$250,0000$1.8 million2012-Scott$500,0000 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature$1.4 million2013-Scott$500,000$2.5 million$1.3 million2014-Scott$500,000$2.5 million$1.3 millionSo why did Scott veto $1.5 million in 2012 but then approve $2.5 million in 2013 and again in 2014?Representatives of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence met with state staff after the veto, said Jennifer Dritt, the nonprofit group’s executive director.""There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor’s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget,"" Dritt said. ""We were never in any governor’s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013.""The increase in money has allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services.For example, the Nancy J. Cotterman center in Broward used the $255,000 in new money over two years to hire a full-time crisis intervention specialist, part-time crisis intervention counselors and expand community outreach including to hospitals.Dritt said Scott’s veto did not cause any of the 30 rape crisis centers to close in 2012. Two centers have since lost certification and one chose to give it up while one new center was added, bringing the current total to 28.Our rulingIn a fundraising email sent out by the Crist campaign, Frankel wrote that Scott ""closed 30 women’s health care centers around the state."" Crist’s campaign said that the email should have said that Scott cut money for rape crisis centers, but even that smaller claim isn’t accurate.More importantly, the statement that Scott closed 30 health centers is completely wrong.We rate this claim Pants on Fire!  "
PANTS-FIRE,Dan Patrick voted against final version of state budget partly restoring education funding in 2013,"A legislative supporter of more than $5 billion in reductions to public education in 2011 says those cuts had to happen but that he later played a lead role in restoring most of the funding.We knew Patrick chaired the Senate’s education panel. We didn’t recall him leading the charge to restore most of the cut funding.As it turned out, there's no convincing evidence he did.Patrick’s backup informationNo signs of Patrick leading chargeWithout success, we looked for independent confirmation of Patrick leading the charge for reversing most of the 2011 cuts.As the session proceeded, according to news stories and advocates for education groups, House members including Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Democrats including Rep. Sylvester Turner of Houston, propelled the final budget (which Patrick voted against) to increase education spending by $3.4 billion -- more than double the original Senate hike.Some education groups including the Texas Association of School Boards and the Equity Center, which represents property-poor school districts, declined to comment on whether Patrick led the charge to restore dollars.Josh Sanderson, a lobbyist for the Association of Texas Professional Educators, told us education groups didn’t find Patrick receptive to reversing the 2011 cuts. ""He never responded positively,"" Sanderson said by phone.Sanderson and Lonnie Hollingsworth, who advocates for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, said pressure to escalate education spending mostly came from House members, among them Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton. By phone, Hollandsworth singled out Pitts and Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, R-Killeen, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, and Democratic Reps. Turner and Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio.""It’s really not any one individual who led the charge for the partial restoration of funding,"" Hollingsworth said.Clay Robison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, said by email Patrick’s vote against the final budget ""is what counts. If the final budget doesn’t pass, it doesn’t matter how much a legislator put into the budget for education or any other program."" Patrick, Robison said, ""didn’t convince me or TSTA that he cared any more about adequate education funding than he did in 2011.""Garcia, informed of what we were finding, stressed Patrick’s chairmanship of the education panel. ""The chairmanship says it all,"" he said.Our rulingPatrick said that in the 2013 session, ""I led the charge to restore most of the education cuts from last session.""In the session, Patrick voted twice for a version of the budget elevating education spending by $1.5 billion, or less than a third of the earlier reduction. He later voted against the final budget driving up such spending by $3.4 billion, a decision he didn’t clarify to us. On balance, it’s not clear to us how someone can lead in putting money back by voting against putting money back.This claim grades out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Facebook post claims U.S. flight canceled after 'terrorist dry run',"The account, written by a man named Tedd Petruna, describes how 11 passengers ""in full Muslim attire"" on AirTran Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston made such a ruckus that the flight was canceled.Petruna claims that one of the men called a stewardess an ""infidel dog,"" that two of the men were showing ""footage of a porno video they had taped the night before,"" and that all 11 men screamed at the flight crew in Arabic. Eventually, Petruna says, Transportation Security Administration agents searched the men’s bags, and that when they allowed them back on, so many passengers left the plane that the flight was canceled.""The terrorists wanted to see how the TSA would handle"" them, Petruna wrote. Only Fox News reported that the flight was canceled, Petruna says, and even they covered up the real ""threat.""Spoiler alert: Petruna’s report is a hoax, and not a new one either. The plane in question flew Nov. 17, 2009. In this fact-check, we’ll explain this conspiracy theory’s origin, then debunk it again for good measure.Remember chain emails?We reached out to Dwayne Chassion, the man who posted Petruna’s report on Facebook verbatim as it appeared in 2009, but didn’t hear back. After we messaged him, Chassion deleted the post from his Facebook account.Apparently, the man didn’t speak English -- he and his group of 11 others were travelling with a translator -- and was looking at pictures on either his phone or a camera. The full group of 13 men got off the plane when the pilot returned to the gate, but, after some discussion with airport officials, the men were allowed back on the plane.The two and a half hour delay pushed the original flight crew past mandated limits on hours worked. So AirTran subbed in a new flight crew and the plane left for Houston without incident -- minus 12 original passengers who, apparently uncomfortable, opted for later flights.That’s marginally similar to Petruna’s account, but the flight was not canceled and there certainly were no Arabic curses or homemade pornographic film.Either way, Flight 297 got off the ground, and although it may have been a tense flight, Petruna’s narrative was bogus then, and it’s bogus now.Our rulingPetruna’s 2009 account about a ""terrorist dry run"" leading to a canceled flight is going viral on Facebook. According to Petruna, 11 Muslim men were so uncooperative with their flight attendants that Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston was canceled.But the airline, other passengers from the flight, and the Associated Press all disagreed. Petruna, although originally scheduled for the flight, never boarded. In actuality, a man who may or may not have been of Muslim descent didn’t speak English well enough to understand the flight attendant’s instructions to turn off his phone.Petruna’s account is outdated and riddled with inaccuracies. This claim rates Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Facebook meme claims McDonald's burgers are made with 85 percent 'meat filler,' which causes cancer","An unsavory Facebook meme is reigniting alarm about the content of Big Macs.McDonald’s said back then that it pulled the product from its grills. But a meme circulating this summer suggests otherwise.We wanted to know more about this ""meat filler,"" what place, if any, it has in McDonald’s burgers, and if it is linked to cancer.Big Mac smackFirst, McDonald’s says it no longer uses the ""meat filler"" in question.""McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011. While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world.""As for what exactly is in the patties, McDonald’s writes, ""Our burgers in the US are made using only 100 percent USDA-inspected beef. There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called ‘pink slime’ in our beef. The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling.""Despite rising costs of beef, McDonald’s has no plans to reintroduce lean, finely textured beef (the preferred industry term term for what critics call ""pink slime""), said McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb.Primer on ""meat filler""But what exactly is lean, finely textured beef, and is it considered ""real beef""?Essentially, the goal is to get every piece of meat off of the bone, and then sanitize it so it is safe to eat. Here’s how the process works:The resulting meat has a finer texture. ""That’s why you wouldn’t have a hamburger that would be made from nothing but LFTB – the texture would be softer,"" said Eric Mittenthal, a spokesperson for the American Meat Institute, a national trade association.The lean beef typically comprises no more than 15 percent of a burger, which consumers actually prefer over 100 percent coarse muscle meat, according to Edward Mills, a professor of meat science at Pennsylvania State University. At 25 percent, most people will notice an obvious difference in taste.So a burger with 85 percent of the lean product -- the amount pinpointed in the meme -- is not realistic.A cancer link?Now let’s look at the potential health effects of eating this kind of beef. Could it really lead to stomach and intestinal cancer?The story also quoted a USDA scientist referring to the product as ""pink slime."" Gerald Zirnstein wrote to USDA colleagues in 2002, ""I do not consider the stuff to be ground beef, and I consider allowing it in ground beef to be a form of fraudulent labeling.""But meat experts said BPI’s product is just as safe -- or unsafe -- as all other beef products.The poultry industry has used meat from fat trimmings for 40 years, said Ted LaBuza, a professor of food science at the University of Minnesota. And ammonium hydroxide is used in many food products, such as puddings and cheese, and at levels 10 times higher than in meat, said Mittenthal and Mills.We could not find any studies to suggest that ammoniated beef can lead to stomach cancer or other intestinal disease. Even if you eat a burger with lean, finely textured beef every day, ""you wouldn’t even come close"" to posing a serious hazard to your health --  at least, not because of the ammonium hydroxide, said Mills.And it’s fairly common to use ammonia and other chemicals -- such as citric acid, which can leave a sour flavor -- to treat meat, LaBuza said.Chances of becoming sick are actually lower with beef from McDonald’s compared to a local butcher, who is beholden to less stringent standards than fast food restaurants, he said.Our rulingAn Internet meme accuses McDonald’s of using hamburger meat that contains only 15 percent ""real beef,"" with the rest made up of a ""meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer.""McDonald’s stopped using the ""filler"" in question -- lean, finely textured beef or its somewhat misleading nickname ""pink slime"" -- back in 2011. When the product was on the grills, the burger most likely contained nowhere near 85 percent of meat filler, as experts said most consumers would notice a difference in taste after 25 percent. What’s more, the lean beef does not have any documented links to cancer."
PANTS-FIRE,Sen. Begich wrongly ties Republican opponent to horrific crime in inflammatory ad,"""(Sullivan) let a lot of sex offenders get off with light sentences,"" says the ad’s narrator, identified as a retired police officer, standing outside of an Anchorage apartment complex. ""One of them got out of prison and is now charged with breaking into that apartment building, murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter. Dan Sullivan should not be a U.S. senator.""The ad did not mention Active by name, but it gave a detailed description of the crime -- which received significant coverage in the Alaska media last year -- in front of the building where it occurred.Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active’s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn’t line up.Doing timeBegich’s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active’s sentencing and the May 2013 crime.In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl’s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009).Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich’s ad.When drawing up Active’s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active’s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That’s typically a misdemeanor, but Active’s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.)Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active’s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years.Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general.The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active’s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active’s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active’s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.)""There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time,"" Skidmore said.Part of a trend?The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum.Our rulingBegich said Sullivan approved a ""light sentence"" to a sex offender who is now charged with ""murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter.""Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general. So to pin the error on Sullivan is wrong, and to suggest that he actively approved the sentence is a fabrication. The ad is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.

PANTS-FIRE,"Bloggers incorrectly blast ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, saying 73% goes to overhead, fundraising","By now, there are very few Americans who haven’t heard of the ""ALS Ice Bucket Challenge"" -- the social media-driven campaign during the summer of 2014 to dump ice water on your head as a way of raising awareness of the neuromuscular disease ALS and promoting donations to the ALS Association, which funds medical research and support programs for those who have the disease.But not everyone is happy about this development. A blog called politicalears.com posted an article stating that the Ice Bucket Challenge was a ""fraud"" because most of the money was being spent on administration and overhead. The unsigned post was picked up widely on social media feeds; that’s where PolitiFact readers noticed it. Several of them asked us to check it out, so we did. (The website has no contact information, so we were unable to reach the person who wrote the post.)""The ALS Foundation is a terrible organization to send your money. If you decide to take the Ice Bucket Challenge, may I humbly suggest that you select a well-researched charity (on your own, no endorsements here) and send it to them.""The post reprints a pie chart taken directly from the ALS Association’s website, showing the following breakdown of expenses:Now for the blog post’s biggest mistakes:Not true. The 73 percent figure appears to come from subtracting everything except for the 27 percent that falls under ""research."" The charitable way (no pun intended) of viewing the post’s error is that it misread the category headings.Once you include ""patient and community services"" and ""public and professional education"" as legitimate spending to advance the group’s stated mission, the percentage spent on items supporting those goals rises to nearly 79 percent.But the blog post actually exacerbated its error by specifically labeling 73 percent of the group’s spending as ""fundraising, overhead, executive salaries and external donations."" That’s flat wrong.""We were very surprised to see the ALS-related report which attributes certain statements to ECFA,"" Dan Busby, the group’s president, told PolitiFact. ""We did not provide any information for the story.""Busby added that, contrary to what the blog post said, his group doesn’t have a ""bright line"" test for a charity’s appropriate spending percentage. ""The data of applicants and members which reflect high overhead expenses are carefully analyzed for propriety,"" he said. ""In addition to considering the financial picture of a potential donee charity, we believe donors should also look at other attributes, including the charity's commitment to effective board governance, financial integrity, and appropriate accountability.""Other groups that analyze charities have given the ALS Association high scores.Our rulingThe blog post said that ""over 73 percent of all donations raised (from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge) are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations."" Whether purposely or by incompetence, the anonymous blogger misreported the ALS Association’s figures.

PANTS-FIRE,Did Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad charter a jet to send 124 immigrant children back to Honduras?,"The surge in unaccompanied minors coming from Central America to the U.S. border with Mexico may have moved off the front pages in recent weeks, but it’s still a hot topic on the Internet.A reader recently sent us a chain email that lauds Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, for purportedly standing up to President Barack Obama’s decision to send more than 100 unaccompanied minors to Iowa. According to the email, Branstad quickly chartered a jet for the immigrant children and flew them all back to Honduras.Spoiler alert: This adventure story is pure fiction.Here’s the text of the email our reader received, complete with a misspelling of the governor’s name:""Subject: Obama Flies Illegal Teens to Iowa -- Iowa Governor Flies Them Home""Did you know this?""Obama just said ‘Up yours Iowa’ and Iowa shoved it back. Governor of Iowa -- Hurray for you, Governor, who announced: Iowa will not take any illegals kids (most teenagers) in IOWA.  ""Yesterday Obama overruled him and sent him 124 young kids 13-19, landed the plane in Des Moines. Airport manager called the office of Governor Terry Bransted, who drove to the airport and chartered from Chicago a plane from United. Within 8 hours all the kids were loaded on, got food and drink. The plane left Iowa 8 o'clock Des Moines. Next stop was Honduras. Plane got unloaded, 4 social workers from Iowa made sure they got to the terminal, told the Honduras officials, here are your kids, they have no papers, you let them come illegal to America. Iowa refuses to take them. Iowa has their own laws. No minors who are not with adults. Iowa has not heard one thing from Washington. American states are fed up. ""The Governor is a Republican.

""It’s a rumor we have heard about for several weeks now, but it did not happen,"" said Jimmy Centers, Branstad’s communications director.Moreover, a governor like Branstad wouldn’t have the power to quickly deport dozens of children back to Honduras -- that’s a process governed by federal, not state, law.""Airport travel, as interstate commerce, is governed by federal law and Congress,"" said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis law school and a specialist in immigration law. ""State infringement on interstate commerce has repeatedly been struck down by the Supreme Court. State laws taxing entrants into the state have been struck down for about the last century. The Iowa scenario could never happen lawfully.""In mid July -- before the email began circulating -- Branstad offered a mixed reaction to the possibility that some unaccompanied immigrant minors would end up in Iowa.Our rulingThe chain email said that Branstad chartered a plane to remove 124 young illegal immigrants from his state and take them back to Honduras. Branstad’s office denies this, and there is no credible evidence to undercut the governor’s account. In addition, Branstad would have no authority to make such a move on his own.

""The fact that we have a law on the books under Rick Scott that says the Office of Insurance Regulation can't regulate insurance is astounding. We deserve better, you deserve better.""But the state Republican Party was quick to contradict Crist, making the first comment on that response.""Wrong, Charlie,"" the GOP’s Facebook account wrote. ""It's Obamacare that prevents OIR (the Office of Insurance Regulation) from regulating insurance … a law that you think is great even though premiums will go up by double digits for Floridians.""So who’s right? Does Obamacare keep Florida’s insurance regulator from regulating insurance? We’re not going to make you fill out dozens of forms in triplicate to find out, because we’ve got you covered.Regulating the regulatorsPolitiFact Florida has looked at a version of this claim before, when Florida’s Democratic members of Congress complained in a letter to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.The Legislature decided that if the federal government wanted a say over policy premiums, then they could go ahead and regulate it themselves.Republicans passed SB 1842 largely along party lines, with Scott writing, ""I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period.""Ironically, the Republican Party of Florida told us it was referring directly to the portion of the Affordable Care Act that says state law is to be followed unless it contradicts the federal health care law, and that’s why Obamacare makes the insurance commissioner obsolete when it comes to setting rates.Experts we talked to said that doesn’t mean Washington can or wants to do Florida’s job.""If a state doesn’t have rate review authority, then no one really has the power to review them,"" Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost, who supports the law, told us. ""If Florida can’t do it, then no one can.""Jost said the federal government does have some power over insurers in Florida. It can ask insurance companies to explain those so-called unreasonable rates, then deny the companies the ability to sell in that state if the government chooses. The company would have to disclose to policyholders and potential customers it had been reviewed for unreasonable rates, an undesirable distinction. The ACA also has a provision requiring at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates to customers.But that’s not the same kind of power that a state has to regulate health insurance directly, he said.Florida is unique in its unwillingness to let what the federal government considers an effective regulatory agency to do its own job, according to Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group.""The intent of Obamacare was to keep states in charge of regulating insurance,"" Mellowe said. ""Instead, the Legislature changed state law to take away Florida’s rate review.""Our rulingThe Republican Party of Florida said Obamacare ""prevents (Florida) from regulating insurance.""That’s not at all the case. The Affordable Care Act says if states can regulate premiums, they should. States only have to bring laws up to minimum Obamacare requirements. The federal government only intervenes in states that don’t have effective rate review programs -- something Florida can do on its own but won’t, thanks to the 2013 law passed by the Republican-led Legislature.The state GOP not only misrepresented the terms of the Affordable Care Act, but it also implied the Democratic president’s signature law was to blame for the state’s (temporary) regulatory woes. It was mostly Republican lawmakers who spearheaded that change to Florida law, after the state rejected a $1 million federal grant to help improve the process. Most other states regulate insurance rates without the difficulty the Republican Party of Florida claimed.We rate the statement Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Ted Cruz bribed by Kochs? Strike a match,"Ted Cruz took a bribe?Its message, brought to our attention by a reader, said: ""This is Sen. Ted Cruz, a Koch puppet. He was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would gift or sell them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging."" In Cruz’s Senate office, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed Cruz this summer offered a proposal, which wasn’t acted on, for the federal government to shed excess lands, but she said in an email the Occupy Democrats statement ""looks like nothing more than politically charged rhetoric with no facts to back it up.""Group lacks evidence of bribeOccupy Democrats didn’t offer evidence of Cruz getting money or another benefit to introduce his proposal.""We consider it bribery,"" Rivero said, ""when a shadowy, wide-reaching corporate interest political machine like the Kochs’ bankrolls a U.S. senator’s political operation and then that same senator turns around and supports a major piece of legislation desired by those corporate interests.""What Cruz proposedWe looked over the amendment, contacted a Koch spokesman and asked advocates familiar with Cruz’s proposal about this claim.Cruz’s proposal said land under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Interior and Agriculture departments in any state shouldn’t exceed half the state’s land area. In states where those agencies do control more than half the land, Cruz proposed, the government should sell the ""excess"" land at auction or transfer it to the state. His amendment called for auctions or transfers to take place by 2020.Frazier of Cruz’s office said he offered the amendment, as he had once before, because ""he believes in principles of small government and like many conservatives, feels that federal ownership of land in the states should be limited so that the federal government does not own more than half of the land in any state."" Asked the precise origin of the idea, Frazier said: ""It came from him. He thinks the federal government should get out of the landlord business.""Koch role?To our inquiry, Rob Tappan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for Koch Public Sector, part of Koch Industries, said by email the Kochs had no position on Cruz’s amendment nor, he said, did it lobby the issue or contact Cruz’s office to discuss it.Shrinking federal lands not a new ideaExperts familiar with Cruz’s idea said they were unaware of information confirming the Occupy Democrats’ claim. Each also said it's not a novel idea to reduce the amount of federally owned land.By email, Regan said Cruz’s proposal reflected ""a sentiment in many western states that local control of public lands is more desirable than management by distant federal bureaucracies.""Of note, Regan said, three states affected by Cruz’s proposal -- Idaho, Nevada and Oregon -- are not oil-and-gas rich. He noted too that under the proposal, the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would be responsible for identifying acreage to be auctioned off or transferred. Regan speculated: ""These almost certainly would not be national parks, wilderness areas, or other ‘pristine’ federal lands, but would likely be lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service—many of which are already managed for logging, grazing, and energy development.""Our rulingOccupy Democrats said Cruz ""was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging.""If excess federal lands were put up for auction, as possible under Cruz’s amendment, anyone including the Kochs could perhaps purchase the lands and then, as the owners, possibly chop down trees, drill for oil and the like.All this said, this group failed to provide (nor did we find) evidence of a bribe or any Koch-linked inducement causing Cruz to present his proposal nor did we find confirmation his proposal came about so pristine federal lands could be exploited.Campaign contributions aren’t bribes and suspicions aren’t facts.

PANTS-FIRE,GOP challenger Gary Lambert says rival Marilinda Garcia supports $140 billion in new taxes,"The former state senator from Nashua pledged sound leadership for New Hampshire’s economy if he’s elected to represent the 2nd Congressional District.Lambert also criticized his major opponent in the GOP primary, state Rep. Marilinda Garcia, asserting that Garcia supports ""$150 billion in new taxes.""Lambert said the move would result in massive job losses, and his campaign flyer pictured Garcia’s face on the side of a building, underneath a sign that reads ""Going out of business.""To get to the bottom of it, PolitiFact New Hampshire asked Lambert’s campaign for an explanation of where the $150 billion figure came from.Garcia said that small businesses are at a disadvantage because, unlike large corporations, they can’t hire lawyers and accountants who are able to ""find those loopholes that could reduce your tax rate from 35 (percent) to 20 (percent) like the big companies do.""""So that’s a big problem,"" she continued. ""We need to close those types of loopholes.""Lambert argues that by calling for Congress to close ""those types of loopholes,"" Garcia was calling for the elimination of the entire system of tax credits, exemptions and other mechanisms that allow companies to lower their taxes.Those mechanisms are collectively known as ""tax expenditures,"" a term the federal government uses to describe revenue lost because of tax deferrals, preferential tax rates, exclusions, exemptions or deductions.Combined, the federal government will provide corporate tax expenditures worth an estimated $148 billion in fiscal 2014, according to numbers crunched by the White House Office of Management and Budget.That’s close to the $150 billion figure cited by Lambert’s campaign. However, there are several caveats to consider.To begin with, it’s hard to know exactly how much new revenue the country would receive if any tax expenditures were eliminated. It wouldn’t necessarily be $148 billion.There’s also the question of whether the reforms would apply solely to corporations, or if tax breaks for both corporations and individuals would be eliminated.Many are available to both types of taxpayers. In fact, a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office determined that more than two-thirds of the tax expenditures used by corporations in 2011 were also used by individual taxpayers.That means tax breaks used exclusively by businesses -- the segment Garcia was referencing in her comments -- account for only a portion of the $148 billion worth of corporate tax expenditures.It’s also worth noting that eliminating a loophole isn’t the same thing as instituting a new tax, as Lambert suggests. Any new revenue would simply come from existing taxes.Garcia also disputes the notion that she would support any net increase in taxes. Her communications director, Kenny Cunningham, wrote that Garcia hopes to lower the overall corporate tax rate by eliminating special interest-backed tax loopholes.""Marilinda has pledged multiple times not to support any new increases in the tax burden and has a long voting record in the NH Legislature to prove her commitment to action on this issue, not just words,"" Cunningham wrote.Our rulingLambert claimed that Garcia supports $150 billion in new taxes. His statement was based on a remark Garcia made about closing tax loopholes that help big corporations.Even if one accepts the premise that Garcia wants to end all tax breaks for corporations, the expenditures she’s referring to would probably be valued at less than $150 billion, unless Garcia also supported ending tax breaks that are available to both companies and individuals.According to her campaign manager, Garcia would not support any increase in the tax burden. Instead, she seeks to eliminate loopholes that benefit special interests while working to lower the overall corporate tax rate.Not only is Lambert’s campaign mailer inaccurate, but it offers such an astronomically high figure that the claim is far-fetched.For these reasons, Lambert’s claim earns a rating of Pants on Fire."

And there’s really no case that a bioweapons lab in Kenema is behind the outbreak.""The assertion is absurd,"" said Chris Williams, spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

PANTS-FIRE,Did Rand Paul propose cutting off aid to Israel?,"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a trip to Iowa in early August, hoping to gain support in the key presidential caucus state. But Paul ended up attracting some controversy.So was Paul correct when he said, ""I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past""? We took a closer look.Back in 2011, when Paul was just settling into the Senate, he proposed a budget that was more fiscally conservative than the proposals offered by his Republican contemporaries. In a bid to cut $500 billion from the federal budget, Paul proposed a spending outline that would have eliminated foreign aid entirely.Paul’s cuts weren’t targeted at Israel specifically, which gets about $3 billion a year from the United States, mostly in military assistance. But by cutting all aid to foreign countries, Paul’s proposal would have zeroed out Israel’s aid.His proposal went on to address the situation of Israel specifically, leading off the section with a quote from Stanford University economist Alvin Rabushka: ""Free money is the scourge of Israel’s economy. It is the difference between a free, prosperous Israel and a statist, dependent Israel.""""While this budget proposal does eliminate foreign aid to Israel, it is not meant to hurt, negate, or single out one of America’s most important allies. This proposal eliminates all foreign aid to all countries. Israel’s ability to conduct foreign policy, regain economic dominance, and support itself without the heavy hand of U.S. interests and policies, will only strengthen the Israeli community. The elimination of all foreign aid, including provisions to Israel, is not necessarily a new idea. In 1996, during an address before the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his nation would eventually wean itself from dependence on U.S. foreign aid. Prominent Israeli politicians and economists alike have called for the end of foreign aid. Among them is economist Amon Gafney, who served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 1970 to 1981. He pointed out that foreign aid has caused Israel to suffer from ―Dutch Disease, a situation in which a generous gift brings short-term benefits but impairs a country’s long-term competitiveness.""In the run-up to the release of this budget document, Paul defended his zeroing-out strategy for foreign aid -- and its effect of ending aid for Israel -- in at least three separate interviews.""People emphasize too much the cuts to one particular country,"" Paul told Weigel, referring to Israel. ""We had $500 billion of cuts. The cuts to that one particular country were three-fifths of 1 percent of it.""• • •Interestingly, the public and media skepticism about Paul’s proposal to end all foreign aid, including aid to Israel, led the senator to backtrack.First, the new proposal scraps the section on Israel in its entirety. Indeed, Israel isn’t mentioned anywhere in the 65-page document. And second, Paul’s new bottom line for foreign aid wasn’t to cut it to zero. Rather, the proposal said, ""Freeze foreign aid funding at $5 billion."" Though the report doesn’t say so explicitly, that would have been enough to cover the outlays for Israel.This provides strong evidence that Paul, after taking fire for his foreign-aid policy in January, February and March 2011, abruptly reversed course.""Sen. Rand Paul has never proposed any legislation that targeted Israel’s aid and just last week voted to continue and increase funding to the State of Israel. Sen. Paul is a strong supporter of the Jewish state of Israel. In 2011, Sen. Paul proposed a budget resolution that did not include certain foreign assistance programs in an effort to balance the budget in five years. Subsequent budget proposals made by Sen. Paul have included up to $5 billion for foreign assistance to account for U.S.-Israel security interests.""Our rulingPaul said, ""I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past."" That’s rewriting history.Not only did Paul say he would eliminate all foreign aid during multiple media interviews in January and February of 2011, but as late as March of that year, his office released a budget proposal that included a zeroing-out of foreign assistance, with a section specifically inserted to defend the effect that policy would have on Israel.Paul is free to change his position, but saying he never held the position in the first place is flatly contradicted by his past statements and documents.

PANTS-FIRE,"Adler supporter's Mike Martinez money claim unsupported, ridiculous","A supporter of an Austin mayoral candidate declared that another candidate accepts corporate donations--which would be illegal, he did not add.In a July 29, 2014, Facebook post, Eugene Sepulveda of Austin, treasurer for attorney Steve Adler’s mayoral campaign, declared Adler isn’t taking ""corp money, PAC money or bundled contributions,"" meaning money gathered from multiple sources by a single person.Commenting below Sepulveda’s post, Austin political consultant Mark Littlefield, who supports City Council member Mike Martinez for mayor, asked: ""Are other candidates taking corporate money?""Sepulveda replied: ""Mike Martinez takes corporate money. Steve won’t.""A Martinez backer, Jose Velasquez, asked us to check Sepulveda’s claim.We wondered first if perhaps laws have changed dramatically so that Texas candidates may accept corporate donations.Not so, we were reminded, in that Texas adopted its ban on corporate donations to candidates more than a century ago.We asked Sepulveda, a social entreprenuer and philanthropist, to elaborate on his Facebook statement. By email, he told us: ""I should have said Mike was taking money from business entities. I was referring to his acceptance of contributions from LLCs as well as PACs and bundlers."" LLCs are Limited Liability Companies.""My bad for not being more specific,"" Sepulveda wrote. In another email, he said that when Velasquez asked him about the corporate claim, ""I used the term corporate generically, even referring him to the documents filed with the city clerk. If I'd been trying to mislead anyone, I certainly wouldn't have pointed them to the candidate-filed reports.""Martinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson told us the campaign earlier confirmed from state records and by contacting each contributor that none of the LLCs giving to Martinez’s effort had corporate members. Hudson agreed it would be illegal for Martinez to accept corporate donations.Meanwhile, Sepulveda replied to us that he had since posted a comment on Facebook, below his original claim, stating he should have said Martinez accepted donations from business entities including LLCs rather than corporations. It appeared the afternoon of Aug. 4, 2014.Our rulingSepulveda said on Facebook that Martinez takes corporate donations.That’s not so. In fact, corporate donations remain forbidden and accepting such could lead to a felony charge. However, any candidate may field contributions from PACs and LLCs (so long as a donor LLC has no corporate members).This advocate’s claim, which he clarified on Facebook six days later, shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Do women own 1% of the world's land? No,"Sorcha Nic Mhathuna, a spokeswoman for Oxfam Ireland, the national chapter of the worldwide anti-poverty group, said her organization is ""reviewing"" this factoid.""We are aware that this statistic is the subject of substantive debate,"" Mhathuna said.But the source the World Bank cited is a defunct Web page at the United Nations from a UN division that no longer exists.What the (limited) numbers sayFor all the references back to UN Women, someone forgot to ask the professionals there who know the data. Papa Seck, a statistician in the Research and Data Section at UN Women, said there are no global figures on land ownership.""I can tell you for sure that this is not a valid statistic,"" Seck said.Quisumbing and her colleagues noted that measuring land ownership is hardly as simple as it sounds. A woman might have the right to farm a plot of land but not be able to sell it without permission from relatives. Husbands and wives might hold joint title. On top of the need to define what it means to own land, much of the information simply doesn’t exist. Few surveys ask about land ownership at all and those that do often don’t ask about gender. After looking at the best studies they could find, Quisumbing and the others decided that any statement at the global or even regional level would be a ""gross oversimplification.""That said, using research from eight African countries, they found that women were generally less likely to be landholders, but the range was large. In Mali, women represented about 3 percent, in Ethiopia, about 18 percent and in Cape Verde, 50 percent.""Women’s land rights are critically important,"" Doss wrote. ""Yet, using unsubstantiated statistics for advocacy is counterproductive. Advocates lose credibility by making claims that are inaccurate and slow down progress towards achieving their goals because without credible data, they also can’t measure changes.""Doss offered some statistics that advocates could use.""On average, across 10 countries in Africa, 39 percent of women and 48 percent of men report owning land, including both individual and joint ownership. Only 12 percent of women report owning land individually, while 31 percent of men do so.""That was the high water mark for female ownership in Deere’s study. At the other end of the spectrum, in Honduras, women owned 12 percent and men owned about 87 percent, with about 1 percent held jointly.But even in Honduras, the figures refute the Oxfam Ireland claim. Deere said she and others have made this general point since at least 2001.Quisumbing expressed some frustration about Oxfam Ireland’s use of the errant stat. She had brought this up with the American chapter of Oxfam at a meeting in Boston in mid April.""I gave a seminar at Oxfam with a lot of people videoconferenced in and yet these myths prevail,"" Quisumbing said.The origins of the 1 percent claimIn other words, the 1 percent statistic about land was a guess. And it stuck.Our rulingOxfam Ireland circulated a graphic with the claim that women own 1 percent of the world’s land. The organization cited well-known bodies such as the World Bank and the United Nations, but none of those sources offered hard evidence. In fact, several pointed back to UN Women, and statisticians there reject this figure.The data that do exist suggest that women own much less land than men but the situation varies widely from country to country. Plus, the statistic implies that whatever land women don’t own, men do, and that is hugely incorrect.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Townhall editor claims U.S. agency can shut down a business for any reason,"The bureau, which opened in 2011, has rulemaking powers, supervises certain financial institutions and checks out complaints from consumers about lending practices that may violate the law.An editor of the conservative news website Townhall claimed it has more nefarious aims.That seemed like a lot of unilateral power, so we wanted to look into her claim.Federal rulemaking funJust one problem: The cease-and-desist order isn’t what Pavlich thinks it is.One of Ballard Spahr’s attorneys told us the rule Pavlich referenced is not meant to gut businesses’ rights and is typical of other federal and state financial regulators.""It’s not like a blank check to put somebody out of business,"" said Christopher Willis, a Ballard Spahr partner and consumer finance attorney who represents financial institutions that would be subject to the rule. ""It’s supposed to be tied to stopping someone from violating the law.""Here’s how Willis explained it to us:  When the agency thinks a business has broken the law, the agency can file a lawsuit, pursue administrative proceedings or do a cease-and-desist order. But a cease-and-desist order is to cease-and-desist violating the law -- not to stop existing.Moreover, the agency didn’t give itself the power to issue cease-and-desist orders, Congress did. Section 1053(c) of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allows the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct cease-and-desist proceedings.Power with precedent So we know the agency didn’t just assign itself this power. But there are more issues to address with Pavlich’s claim that the rule gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ""unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes.""Is the cease-and-desist authority unprecedented?Not really. Other banking agencies have had this power for a long time, Willis said.Can the agency shut down businesses for any reason?The agency is tasked with overseeing a large amount of businesses -- mainly payday lenders, non-bank mortgage lenders, banks and credit unions with assets over $10 billion, and private student loan lenders. Still, we’re not talking about mom and pop’s pizza shop. The agency can only go after the businesses it’s tasked with overseeing.Gilford said the agency has not yet issued a cease-and-desist order. But when it does, it can’t just do it for any reason.""Any temporary cease-and-desist order issued by the CFPB must describe the basis for the order, the alleged violations of the law, and the harm that is likely to result without the issuance of an order,"" Gilford said.That said, the agency is powerful and operates with more autonomy than other agencies, Willis said. Its budget is not controlled by Congress, and its director is insulated from the political process after the president appoints him or her.""So there’s a lot of criticism against the agency for lack of democratic accountability,"" Willis said. ""But it has nothing to do with cease-and-desist programs.""Our rulingShe is mistaken, an attorney who represents the financial services industry told us.Pavlich ignores several key facts about the agency’s temporary cease-and-desist authority. Namely, it’s not unprecedented, it’s not issued without reason, and it’s meant to stop violations of law, not the business altogether.We rate her claim Pants on Fire."

They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington.""""He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business,"" Romney said. ""Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience.""And that list is just after a cursory review.Finally, we offer one more quote from the 2012 campaign trail:""We know that Mitt Romney had an incredible career in the private sector, turning businesses around that otherwise would have failed, and thousands of people owe their jobs to that today.""The speaker: Scott Walker.Our ratingWalker said that ""Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him.""To the contrary, Romney made frequent and high-profile use of his extensive private-sector credentials, making them the core of his deep and sustained criticism of Obama’s record on handling the economy.Nobody would know that better than Walker, who helped remind voters of nominee’s business-world record.The claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Rick Perry: 'Historic record highs' of people from terrorists states being apprehended at border,"Texas Gov. Rick Perry says the border needs more protection against a record-high number of illegal immigrants coming from terrorist havens, but the figures don’t match Perry’s rhetoric.With Congress scrambling to address illegal immigration before the start of their summer recess this past Friday, it’s no surprise that the issue was a main topic on the Aug. 3, 2014, talk shows.""I'm the governor of the state of Texas. My citizens' safety is what is foremost here. And it hasn't got anything to do with anything other than those numbers of individuals who are coming across the border. And when you think about the idea that some of them are from countries that have substantial terrorist ties, whether it's Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria, we are at historic record highs with individuals being apprehended from those countries,"" Perry said.The claim about illegal immigrants coming from countries with terrorist ties caught our attention.Is it possible, though, that the small number of apprehensions of individuals from those countries in 2012 could be a record?By the numbersWe asked Perry’s office for evidence, but they did not get back to us.YearAfghanistanPakistanSyria2003614,0833692004576411062005557921132006537211512007286541012008*746541012009745758720108859295201110652510820129545856 *Note: Data from 2008 and on includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforcement and removal operations.Based on the DHS data, there were not record apprehensions in 2012 for individuals from the three countries Perry mentioned, nor are apprehensions trending up. In fact, 2012 was the lowest year out of these 10 for Pakistan and Syria.We found that none of these countries had record highs in 2012. Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia hit their record in 2011, though there is no discernible upward trend.The numbers of apprehensions of individuals from these countries is also incredibly low compared to the primary sources of illegal immigrants. In 2012, DHS apprehended nearly 450,000 Mexicans, 55,000 Guatemalans and 50,000 Hondurans. In contrast, officials apprehended 95 Afghanis, 458 Pakistanis and 56 Syrians.JustificationIt’s important to note that while Perry was using this statement to justify bringing more resources to the Texas-Mexico border, an apprehension and other enforcement measures can happen at the border, in the country’s interior or at designated places outside of the United States, according to the DHS document.Historically, only an extremely small number of people from the Middle East or South Asia who try to enter the United States illegally do so by crossing a land border, said Stephen Kelly, former deputy chief of mission for the United States in both Mexico and Canada.""People from those areas are more likely to try to enter via an airport, perhaps with false documents,"" said Kelly, now a public policy professor at Duke University.And many people coming from these countries without a valid visa apply for asylum as soon as they enter the United States, so they are essentially turning themselves in.Our rulingPerry said the United States is at ""historic record highs"" of individuals being apprehended on the border from countries with terrorist ties such as ""Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria.""The most recent data does not show record apprehensions of individuals from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria or any other designated terrorist countries, nor does it show an upward trend in apprehensions of individuals from those areas. Even if it did, many apprehensions of people from these areas happen at airports rather than land borders.We rate Perry’s claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Ed Gillespie says White House is cutting Navy to pay for Obamacare,"The Navy is ailing, and Obamacare is to blame, says Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate.""This administration is slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare,"" he said during a recent debate with Democratic incumbent Mark Warner. ""There’s no two ways about it when looking at their budget.""It wasn’t the first time Gillespie has made this claim on the campaign trail in Virginia, home to the world’s largest Naval base. We decided to see if he’s right.The Navy BudgetHere are the amounts President Barack Obama has requested for the Navy:And here are the amounts Congress appropriated for the Navy:You may notice that the first list goes one year into the future while the second list doesn’t. That’s because Obama has made his Navy budget request for 2015, but Congress hasn’t agreed on the appropriation.There are two important trends in these lists. First, over the course of Obama’s  administration, a chart of his Navy budget requests would look like a hill, sloping up in the early years and then dropping below its starting point. A chart for the congressional allocations would have the same shape. The second trend is that in four of the first five years of the administration, Congress appropriated less Navy money than Obama requested.The trends stem from a partisan showdown over the federal debt in 2011 that resulted in an unhappy compromise. The fight arose over raising the nation’s debt limit so the government could continue to pay its obligations, something Congress had routinely done in the past. This time, however, Republicans insisted on spending cuts in return for raising the limit. Democrats initially refused.The standoff was broken that August by passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which eventually triggered $1.2 trillion in automatic budget cuts over 10 years -- called sequestration -- in exchange for raising the borrowing limit. Half the cuts will be made in domestic programs, which Democrats sought to protect, and half will come in defense spending -- including the Navy -- that Republicans wanted to shield.The cuts began to take effect on March 1, 2013.Is Obamacare tied to Navy cuts?The Navy and Obamacare -- also known as the Affordable Care Act -- are funded under different budget rules.Obamacare was set up to be self-supporting through a series of specially enacted taxes and long-term Medicare savings. It doesn’t rely on an annual appropriation. In other words, the ACA and the Navy are supported by two unconnected funding streams.So where does Gillespie find the link? His campaign sent us a variety of information but none of it tied the Navy cuts to Obamacare. We received:Two long-term budget outlooks published by nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office this year, noting there will be costs for expanding health insurance subsidies under Obamacare. The reports, however, did not address ACA revenues. ""They looked completely at the spending side,"" said Josh Gordon, an analyst for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization urging deficit reduction.Experts told us Gillespie’s linkage of Navy cuts to Obamacare is way off base.""I don’t see any connection between the defense budget and the Affordable Care Act,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a think tank focused on defense policies.Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project for the Project on Government Oversight, called Gillespie’s comment ""specious nonsense.""Our rulingGillespie says the Obama administration is ""slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare.""The claim is erroneous for two reasons. First, Congress is complicit in the Navy budget cuts. By failing to agree on a debt-reduction plan, it triggered a self-imposed regimen of automatic cuts to defense and domestic programs.Second, Obamacare is shielded from those reductions because it’s not subject to annual appropriations from Congress. The ACA is self-funded through a series of specially enacted taxes and health care efficiencies. Its fortunes are not tied to those of Navy.Gillespie, who has made this statement at least twice, sent us plenty of information, but none of it linked the Navy cuts to Obamacare. We agree with the military expert who called the claim ""specious nonsense."" But at PolitiFact, we call it Pants on Fire."

One congressional hopeful thinks so.And what does Whitney think is a big-government ""scam"" and ""conspiracy""? The video’s title says it all: ""Global Warming is a Hoax.""""Energy security is real, global warming is not. It is merely a strategy designed to give more power to the executive branch while increasing taxes in a progressive stream to regulate every aspect of American life,"" Whitney says in the video.Whitney is running for an open seat that represents parts of Baton Rouge. The race is attracting a large field of candidates that includes former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who served time in prison for racketeering.The hoaxWe talked to several climate scientists who said Whitney’s claim was ""laughable,"" ""deeply misguided,"" ""uninformed,"" ""disgusting"" and ""absurd.""The study says that the few ""contrarian"" scientists are a vocal, but small, minority. They also found that those scientists denying human-caused climate change tend to have less expertise in the subject than those who believe in it.Beyond the surveys, there is a consensus among the world’s premier science organizations -- such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society in London -- that human-caused global warming is real, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociology professor at Oklahoma State University. (Not to mention NASA, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.)David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said there is no legitimate reason to doubt the severity of climate change.""A true conservative would be prudent, listen to the experts and take action to address the threat,"" Jenkins said. His group aims to foster understanding about the environment among conservatives.Climate change skeptics’ talking points have evolved since the 1990s as the scientific evidence has grown, said Dunlap, who has been studying public opinion of climate change for 20 years. They first said the Earth wasn’t warming. Then they said the Earth was warming, but it’s not caused by human activity. Now, many agree with the science, but it’s not that big of a problem.""But in (Whitney’s) case, she’s reverting to some of the most primitive statements,"" Dunlap said.Her evidence?Whitney’s supporting evidence used in her video is too simplistic to be meaningful.Here's a few of her pieces of evidence:The past 150 years have been characterized by overall warming, with intermittent periods of slowed warming or cooling, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder.""Fifty years from now, and assuming that carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at current rates, the period of slower warming from the late 1990s (of 2006) to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming,"" he said.Whitney also said, ""Last summer, Antarctica reached the coldest temperature in recorded history.""It was more a triumph of technology, because a satellite recorded the temperature remotely.And Whitney said there is ""record sheet ice and a 60 percent rise of ice in the Arctic sea.""Overall, sea ice (measured every September via satellite) has decreased about 13 percent each decade since 1981, Serreze said.A bonus: Jenkins pointed out that the thermometer Whitney holds up in her video is not a weather thermometer, but a medical thermometer.Our rulingWhitney said, ""global warming is a hoax.""There is an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real, and Whitney’s supporting evidence falls flat.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"David Alameel misfires on claim John Cornyn ""decided to dodge his draft""","David Alameel, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee in Texas, told delegates to his party’s convention that he joined the military when his Republican foe, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, was ducking the Vietnam War.Alameel, a wealthy investor, said in June 2014: ""My wife and I struggled. There were times when we couldn’t even afford to buy milk for our baby. … So I joined the military at a time in the early 1970s when John Cornyn decided to dodge his draft simply to go to college.""Draft dodger – the term conjures up images of Americans unwilling to serve their country and sneaking off to Canada or faking injuries or pulling strings to avoid military service.Then again, according to a 1993 book on the draft by George Q. Flynn, more than 2 million college-going men put off being drafted in the era by seeking and receiving student deferments from the government that legally sheltered them as long as they stayed in school and kept up grades.Alameel declines to elaborateDrew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn’s campaign, asked us to review Alameel’s claim.For starters, we asked Alameel, who served in the Army in 1974-77, how he reached his assessment. Sergio Cantu, an Alameel spokesman, said by email the campaign would discuss ""Cornyn’s draft dodging at the appropriate time.""How the draft workedGenerally, men who received a draft notice in the mail had about three weeks to return paperwork requesting a hearing for a deferment, a Selective Service System spokesman advised. A local draft board decided whether to grant any requested waiver. ""For the Vietnam war and World War II, any time there was a draft, there were classifications of deferments,"" Pat Schuback of the Selective Service System said. ""If you were eligible for it, you were entitled to claim that deferment.""Another factor emerged. Flynn wrote that President Richard Nixon, with congressional approval, launched an annual lottery in November 1969 that was pitched as randomizing which men were most likely to be called up through the draft.Cornyn’s draft statusBut Cornyn, on the verge of his junior year at Trinity, wasn’t classified as available for service.In 2002, he said he’d sought a student deferment. ""I thought college was important,"" Cornyn said, ""and I think certainly I would have been willing to go if we had continued to have a draft at the end of my college deferment.""Did Cornyn dodge draft?""I don’t know how else to define that,"" Alameel said.Alameel’s definition of a draft dodger isn’t generally embraced.Schuback previously told PolitiFact New Jersey a draft dodger isn’t someone who received a legitimate and legal deferment from military service. ""A draft dodger is someone who got drafted and has then fled, or it also might be a person who made a statement by not registering (for the draft),"" he said.On the other hand, Foley said, if ""you believe that every draft-age man should have made himself available for service during the Vietnam War, then that means 20+ million men were draft dodgers -- a pretty extreme view.""Foley also viewed the documents we’d fielded touching on Cornyn’s Selective Service history. He then wondered, by email, how Cornyn could have still not been drafted despite getting a low lottery number.We asked Selective Service about that. By email, Schuback provided the agency’s summary of changes in regulations after Nixon signed a September 1971 act into law described in Flynn’s book as giving the president the discretion to phase out student deferments.According to the summary, men who had qualified for a student deferment in the regular 1970-71 school year would ""be able to obtain deferments"" going forward at least ""until they graduate."" Cornyn (who got his lottery number after that school year) fit that description, according to the documents we received.The summary went on to say men not qualified for a student deferment in 1970-71 would not be qualified to get one going forward.Our rulingAlameel said Cornyn ""dodged"" the draft during the Vietnam War.This claim puts no stock in Cornyn registering for the draft and qualifying for student deferments, which many men eligible for service took. These men weren’t draft dodgers in the conventional sense of that term; none fled the country or the like. A government document even suggests Cornyn was briefly classified as available for immediate service.Alameel offered nothing but mention of Cornyn seeking a deferment as the basis of his claim which, all told, we find factually unsupported and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,"RT's Peter Lavelle says he doesn't allow conspiracy theories on his show, then utters one","Everything except, he says, conspiracy theories.Lavelle’s commentary on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 thrust him into the media spotlight with a contentious, 10-minute interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, who accused Lavelle of being obsessed with ""clearing Russia from culpability"" in the plane’s shooting. American officials have said the plane was likely shot down by Ukrainian separatists in Donetsk with a surface-to-air missile.Then Lavelle proposed a theory that involves Ukraine bringing down the plane in effort to earn worldwide sympathy amid woes with its new government.""But if I look at the timing of this tragedy in Ukraine, the (Petro) Poroshenko government was, well, in trouble with its latest offensive in the east, it was losing badly, soldiers were being circled, it was really bad news,"" Lavelle said. ""And all of a sudden we have this tragedy of killing civilians on this flight, and this puts Ukraine back on the front page, it competes with Gaza, a lot of ‘sympathy,’ for the Kiev regime, this is good timing in a way for the coup regime that hasn't been achieving too many successes since February.""  Um, so in essence Lavelle is suggesting Ukraine shot down MH 17 so it could blame the Russian separatists so the flailing Ukraine government could become front-and-center again in the news? Sounds like a conspiracy theory to us.But so that we don’t be accused of reaching a Pants on Fire conclusion too quickly, we decided to search around Lavelle’s other shows. We didn’t search every program, but we looked at enough to find that conspiracy theories are very much raised by Lavelle and featured on his show.Here’s a few of those conspiratorial, er, counterintuitive moments that we found with a simple Google search.Conspiracy No. 1: 9/11 was an inside job""Conspiracy theory, if it means anything, is a simple story which you know claims to explain a major complicated event. That is exactly what the official story of the 9/11 attacks is,"" Henshall said. ""Very simple story, all organized by a guy in the cave with 17 hijackers who were just incredibly lucky. You could not get more of a conspiracy theory than that.""Henshall went on to talk about the ""worrying evidence"" that the towers-takedown was an inside job.1. ""WTC towers collapsed due to a controlled demolition;"" 2. ""Attacks an inside job to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;"" 3. ""9/11 attacks in 2001 were intentionally allowed to happen."" Conspiracy No. 2: AIDS drugs kill people with AIDSLavelle invited on guest Peter Duesberg, a University of California-Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, who believes that AIDS treatments are killing people infected with ""the so-called AIDS virus, which doesn’t do anything.""So AIDS isn’t killing people, AIDS drugs are.""The companies try to treat the virus that doesn’t do anything with drugs that are inevitably toxic,"" Duesberg said. ""The AZT was developed 40 years ago for one purpose: to kill human cells for cancer, chemotherapy. And the result is they have never ever cured one AIDS patient.""Lavelle asked Dr. Denis Broun of UNAIDS for feedback. ""We have 2 million people die of HIV infection every year. And these are not people who die of old age, I can tell you that. The average age of people who die in Russia is 32 years. This is preposterous,"" Broun said. ""The antiretrovirals are keeping people alive, and people are staying alive thanks to administration of these products.""Lavelle went back to Duesberg, who said the world’s 30-40 million HIV-infected population is doing well and the people who die are the ones ""getting these drugs that are inevitably toxic.""‘They are designed to terminate DNA synthesis, that’s the central molecule of life, you’re dying from that,"" Duesberg said. ""That is AIDS by prescription. And 500,000 people are prescribed these drugs alone in the U.S. and all of them die, about half of them die from diseases that have nothing to do with HIV.""Another guest, Steve Caterer of Global Pharma Insights, said Duesberg’s opinions ""on the good side are disrespectful and on the worst side are tantamount to murder.""Later in the program, Broun said the three-drug HIV/AIDS drug treatment used today is much less toxic than the AZT-only treatment (azidothymidine) used 25 years ago. ""No one in his right sense is suggesting to use AZT alone today,"" he said. ""It's as if people were suggesting to treat syphilis with arsenic, as was done at the beginning of the century. ... We cannot discuss today's situation with antique data that are no longer valid in any way."" Broun said researchers debate some points of treating the virus, but ""no one is saying, like denying the role of HIV in creating AIDS or saying the drugs are dangerous for people."" Conspiracy No. 3: U.S. official planned to break up Ukraine""It seems to me that there’s this habit now in Western media, particularly in the United States, that no one wants to see fault in themselves or their own governments here. Because this was so predictable, as you said at the beginning of the program, this plan that Victoria Nuland had was just nonsense. She was just going to break up the country, but they had a Plan B. If they don’t succeed, then Russia is a very easy enemy to blame everything on, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now.""Even guest Dmitry Babich, an employee of the Russian-government owned radio station The Voice of Russia, thought Lavelle was going a bit too far.""I don’t think Victoria Nuland planned to break up the country. She thought that the east of Ukraine would just submit to the new government, the new government would be pro-Western, then as the Western media said, we should all take deep breath and then wait until Ukraine becomes completely anti-Russian,"" Babich said. ""And of course Victoria Nuland, just like John Kerry, they don’t know a thing about Ukraine.""Nuland became a notorious figure in the East as U.S. diplomats responded to Ukraine's political crisis, but there's no evidence she had a plan to break up Ukraine. A phone conversation between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt about Ukraine's next steps was leaked, in which she was heard as saying ""F--- the EU.""Our ruling""Never"" is a strong word, yet Lavelle claimed he is a not a conspiracy theorist and has ""never allowed a conspiracy theorist on his show.""We’ll agree there is a somewhat subjective definition of what constitutes a conspiracy theory. But we think of the four we quickly found -- Ukraine downed MH 17 to drum up sympathy, AIDS drugs are what are killings AIDS patients, 9/11 was an inside job, and an assistant secretary of state devised a plan to break-up Ukraine -- at least one would fit most people’s definition of a conspiracy theory.Lavelle’s hypothesis about MH 17, we should note, was uttered in the breaths after saying he doesn’t allow conspiracy theories on his show.We rate his statement Pants on Fire."

""In other words, this is a natural and healthy normal practice that in the context of an additional determinant induces risk. It would not be dissimilar from saying that there would be no cervical cancer if heterosexual people didn’t have sex.""HIV/AIDS overviewThere is no cure for AIDS or HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS and ravages the body’s immune system if untreated.In 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, which was a 30 percent drop from 2005, according to UNAIDS.HIV is carried through body fluids. The virus is passed when HIV-infected fluids enter the bloodstream of someone else, such as through contact with a cut or sore, sharing needles or syringes, or through the vagina, rectum, mouth, or tip of the penis.In the United States, anal sex is the highest-risk behavior for spreading HIV, followed by vaginal sex, sex with multiple partners and sharing needles with someone infected with HIV.Mother-to-child transmissions are not common in the United States thanks to widespread HIV testing of pregnant women and drugs that prevent the virus from affecting a child. Neither is getting the virus through blood transfusions and organ donations and transplants, which are intensely tested for HIV.But what’s true for Americans is not true for other people in the world.World pictureGlobally, the dominant form of transmission is heterosexual sex, said Sophie Barton Knott, UNAIDS spokeswoman. Nearly half of people with HIV are female, and most were infected through heterosexual sex. Most of the 50.9 percent of men with HIV got it through heterosexual sex, too, she said.The highest rates of AIDS among 15- to 24-year-olds is among women in many parts of the world, said Seth Faison, spokesman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And in Eastern Europe, the highest transmission rates of AIDS are among people who inject drugs.""Men who have sex with men are a high-risk group, but not the only one,"" he said.The bottom line?Preventing men from having sex with men will not end AIDS.""In effect, efforts to ‘persuade men not to have sex with men’ is counterproductive,"" Faison said. ""It will not stop AIDS.""Our rulingFischer said, ""We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men.""Though men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in America, this is not a serious solution to ending a pandemic disease. Not in the United States, and certainly not worldwide.Women, children, and men who don’t have sex with men are also at risk, and women make up about half of people worldwide who have HIV/AIDS.Fischer’s claim is ridiculous. It rates Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Unsubstantiated: Greg Abbott attributes 3,000 murders to immigrants here illegally","Greg Abbott, supportive of Gov.

We’ve had about 3,000 murders,"" Abbott said in the July 22, 2014 interview. ""It is a responsibility of a government to keep their people safe. The federal government has the responsibility of securing our border; they’re not doing it, so the state of Texas will do it.""But Perry’s source for the figure, the Texas Department of Public Safety, hadn’t said that.The DPS page states: ""From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails.

By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said: ""We don’t have any additional information to add to the website provided.""Outside criminologistsIn checking Perry’s claim, we’d asked criminologists recommended to us by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York how to interpret the DPS-presented information.Notably, the DPS web page doesn’t specify when the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the ""alien"" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated.By phone, Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in recent years in Texas.Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS.Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said that if one assumed unauthorized residents were responsible for 3,000 of all Texas homicides, that would hold them accountable for 46 percent of the estimated total. That, he said, ""makes no sense."" Martinez said in a follow-up email: ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed.""The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions.Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande.Our rulingAbbott told Van Susteren ""we’ve had about 3,000 murders"" in connection with lax border security.This declaration, it turned out, isn’t substantiated by the cited state presentation which instead indicates 203,000-plus immigrants jailed in Texas in recent years had together accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. These individuals included people living here with legal permission and people here without authorization.Significantly, the presentation doesn’t show the homicides were committed by non-citizens living here without permission. Also, it’s silent on Abbott’s conclusion the immigrants charged with homicide all entered the country due to the border being easy to cross.Absent factual confirmation, the attorney general’s claim strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Social media meme says Alan Greenspan said insecure workers 'serve the masters gladly',"Amid a stubbornly slow economic recovery, a reader recently forwarded us a social media post taking aim at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for using callous language about worker insecurity. The post features images of Greenspan and says:I am AlanAnd, I used to run the Federal Reserve.And, I actually said this:If the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society, because if workers are insecure they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations.The reader wondered if the five-time chairman of the United States’ central bank actually said something so dismissive about America’s economically left-behind. So did we.As it turns out, Greenspan didn’t say it. Instead, it's academic Noam Chomsky's take on something Greenspan said. And Greenspan and Chomsky couldn’t be more different ideologically.So how did this misattribution happen?""That’s part of the business model. It’s the same as hiring temps in industry or what they call ‘associates’ at Walmart -- employees that aren’t owed benefits. It’s a part of a corporate business model designed to reduce labor costs and to increase labor servility. When universities become corporatized ... they want to keep costs down and make sure that labor is docile and obedient. The way to do that is, essentially, temps. …We looked at Greenspan’s Feb. 26, 1997, testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Here’s a portion:""The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quite favorable. … Continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. … Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now, and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity. The willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures, tightened considerably.""Greenspan, in his testimony, then suggests technological change and international competition as possible reasons for worker insecurity, before noting that ""suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards.""Chomsky’s take on the substance of what Greenspan said seems reasonably on target. However, Greenspan’s tone is far different than Chomsky’s. Greenspan’s words are explanatory and analytical, displaying none of the sarcasm that Chomsky, or the creator of the Facebook post, ascribes to them -- especially the part about workers serving their masters ""gladly and passively.""Chomsky added, ""Don’t know anything about Facebook. I don’t use it.""Our rulingThe meme says Greenspan said that ""if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society"" because ""they'll serve the masters gladly and passively."" Those words actually come from a sarcastic critique of Greenspan’s words by Noam Chomsky, not from Greenspan himself. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Rep. Phil Gingrey says migrants may be bringing Ebola virus through the U.S.-Mexico border,"As a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America was arriving on the United States’ southern border this month, Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., expressed concern about the impact they could have on public health.""As you know, the United States is currently experiencing a crisis at our southern border. The influx of families and unaccompanied children at the border poses many risks, including grave public health threats.""As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose. In fact, infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of death in the United States. … Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning.""Health experts agree that when large numbers of people from countries with spotty health care systems make an arduous trek and then get corralled into crowded holding facilities, it can pose a health risk.So is it true that amid the ""crisis at our southern border"" there are ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus"" into the United States?""The border patrol gave us a list of the diseases that they’re concerned about, and Ebola was one of those,"" Gingrey told Russert. ""I can’t tell you specifically that there were any cases of Ebola, I don’t think there were, but of course tuberculosis, Chagas disease, many – smallpox, some of the infectious diseases of children, all of these are concerns.""So is there anything to the Ebola claim?Experts we asked issued a resounding ""No.""First, we checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose job includes tracking outbreaks of serious infectious diseases. Spokesman Daniel J. DeNoon confirmed that the CDC has received no reports of a human Ebola infection anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Ebola cases in humans have never been reported outside of Africa,"" DeNoon said.William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agreed. ""The congressman is misinformed,"" he said. ""There is no Ebola in the Western Hemisphere.""We also checked whether it was plausible for a child or adult entering the United States from Central America via Mexico to be infected with the Ebola virus. CDC scientists call it ""extremely unlikely,"" DeNoon said.Independent experts agreed. ""It’s very, very, highly unlikely if you are talking about someone from Central America who has not traveled to Africa,"" Thomas W. Geisbert, a microbiologist and immunologist specializing in Ebola at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.However, the profile of the jet-flying Ebola carrier doesn’t mesh with the types of people now flocking to the U.S. border.""The incubation period is two to 21 days, so theoretically, an African could fly from an infected area, land in a Mexican airport, take a bus toward the border, hire a coyote to take him across and then ‘present’ with Ebola,"" said Thomas Fekete, section chief for infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. ""But this presupposes a suicidal person who also has the resources for this kind of travel.""Indeed, the prior, scattered examples of exotic and deadly diseases reaching the United States suggest that ""the likelihood of an illegal migrant getting infected and introducing the disease to the U.S. is probably less than that of a ‘legal’ traveler,"" said Daniel G. Bausch, head of the virology and emerging infections department at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No.6 in Lima, Peru.Another problem: If you had such an infection, the chances are good that you would die on the journey to the United States, said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""You would be too sick to make it to the border by foot,"" he said.So where did these ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as ... Ebola virus"" come from?Here are the three links Gingrey’s office sent us that mentioned Ebola directly:When we asked Harley, the spokesman for Gingrey, whether his office considered these three citations to be credible sources supporting the Ebola claim, he backtracked, saying, ""These websites were not our source. The source was communication with border agents and organizations that we work with on immigration regularly."" When we asked for further detail, we did not hear back, so we cannot vet these sources’ credibility.Our rulingGingrey said that amid the ""crisis at our southern border,"" there are ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus.""We don’t dispute that the conditions for newly arrived migrant children pose public health challenges. But Gingrey went well beyond that when he invoked Ebola, a particularly scary and untreatable disease with high mortality rates.The reality is that Ebola has only been found in Africa -- and experts agree that, given how the disease develops, the likelihood of children from Central America bringing it to the U.S. border is almost nonexistent. But most importantly for our fact-check, Gingrey’s office was unable to point to solid evidence that that Ebola has arrived in Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S. border. To the contrary, the CDC and independent epidemiologists say there is zero evidence that these migrants are carrying the virus to the border.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

We want to be clear: The video is a fake.""We’ve known for a long time now that supreme leader Kim Jong-un controls the flow of information to his people, with the television channels only reporting positive stuff about the country.""But in a report posted on YouTube, the media have been caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup.""The report says North Korea’s brave side crushed Japan 7-0, USA 4-0 and China 2-0 in the group stages, before going on to reach the final… against Portugal.""Of course, the real final, which takes place this Sunday, is between Germany and Argentina.""The Outside the Beltway blogger observes at the end, ""This is yet another example of just how pervasive the Kim dictatorship is, and just how hard it will likely be to integrate this nation into the real world when that regime finally falls.""We emailed the blogger and didn’t hear back. Curiously, by the time other readers saw the Metro article he linked to, it said something quite different from the words he quoted. The second sentence was key.""But in a brilliant spoof report posted on YouTube, the media appears to be caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup,"" the Metro article said.We emailed the Metro sports writer to see if the article had been changed from the original but again, no word back. So it’s possible that that sports writer had also been pulled in, but we can’t say.From the comments on the Outside the Beltway blog, it is clear that while most readers doubted the newscast’s authenticity, others were ready to believe that the North Korean propaganda machine was aiming for a personal best in the disinformation category.A dose of realityThere are several reasons the North Korean government would be unlikely to try such a stunt. For one, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the games, although not live. Also, most North Koreans would likely know that about two years ago, their team failed to qualify for the World Cup. It ranks 137 in the FIFA world rankings; only 32 countries get to compete.Soccer stat maven and professor of government at Cornell University Chris Anderson said ""making it to the final is basically impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds.""Stephen Epstein, a specialist in Korean culture and society at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, noted several elements in the video would instantly tell a trained viewer that it was a joke.""As soon as I saw it, I knew what it was,"" Epstein said. ""The way the women was speaking, her accent, sounded like a South Korean broadcaster.  Also she used the word ‘fighting’ (an English word brought over to South Korea). It clearly was not from the north.""In fact, Epstein said he thinks only people outside South Korea ""were suckered."" But he said that’s understandable.""If you don’t have a real familiarity with North Korea and just know what Western media generally provides, this would fit with a preconceived stereotype,"" Epstein said.A mountain birth and a golf scoreIt’s not as though North Korea doesn’t exercise creative license. According to the official biography of its previous leader Kim Jong Il, he was born on  Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture. In reality, historians place his birth on Russian soil near Vladivostok where his father lived in a camp for Korean exiles.There’s also another sports myth, and this one is interesting because it has morphed over time.""He is an excellent golfer,"" the pro told the reporter.With golf as with soccer, stories about North Korea seem to have the ability to take on a life of their own.Our rulingBloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final.

PANTS-FIRE,John DePetro says all the revenue from governor's beach fee increase went to out-of-state firm,"Rhode Island dramatically hiked its beach fees in 2011. But according to WPRO talk-show host John DePetro, the state didn’t get any of that extra money.DePetro was talking about tourism on his July 7, 2014 show, when he told his audience this:""I got so much email from people again complaining just how high the beach fees are. And then we learn this year that although the governor doubled the beach fees, where I think it's 28 bucks if you're from out of state and you want to go to a Rhode Island state beach on the weekend. But on top of that, all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that.""However, the talk show host is misreporting the facts of the story.Here's the nitty gritty:Under the deal, Propark paid the state $1,880,857 for the right to collect fees at the seven state-owned beach facilities. If Propark collected more than that sum, it got to keep the rest until its profit hits $502,143.Daily weekday rates went from $6 to $10 for residents and from $12 to $20 for non-residents. Weekend and holiday rates doubled, going to $14 for residents and $28 for non-residents. The price of a season passes also doubled. Seniors get a 50-percent discount.The state’s contract with Propark required the state to share 20 percent of the extra revenue.According to figures from Terrence Maguire, the Department of Environmental Management's assistant director for financial and contract management, Propark's revenue from the contract jumped from $581,039 in 2010 (the summer when the old fees were still in effect), to $734,963 in 2011 (when the old fees remained in effect through June 30).Propark's profit increased to $822,595 in 2012 (the first full year of the higher fees). Last year, the company took in $756,228.But the state was the biggest winner. Revenue from the beach fees, which had been $1.6 million before the increase, jumped to $2.2 million during the transition year and rose further to nearly $2.8 million in 2012. It declined to $2.5 million last year.As a side note, the big losers were the host communities of Charlestown, Westerly, Narragansett and South Kingstown, which initially got 27 percent of the money from the sale of daily passes, for a total of $558,000 in 2010.But in 2011, their share dropped to $344,000. The chief reason: the General Assembly cut the towns' share from 27 percent of the daily fees to 16 percent.But back to DePetro's point.Overall, from 2011 through 2013, Propark made an extra $571,000 because of the increase in beach admission fees. But contrary to DePetro’s claim, the state made nearly five times as much -- $2.6 million extra compared with 2010.The money goes to the state's general fund, not to DEM.One final point. DePetro is correct that Propark is an out-of-state company. However all of Propark's workers at Rhode Island beaches are Rhode Island residents, Maguire said.Our rulingJohn DePetro said emphatically that ALL of the beach parking revenue generated when the governor raised its fees went to a private company outside Rhode Island.First of all, the governor proposed the fee increase but he didn’t do it on his own. It got the approval of the General Assembly as well.Second, all of the new revenue did not and does not go to the private company.DePetro cited WPRI as his source. But while they got the essential facts right, he did not."
PANTS-FIRE,Did John Roberts issue an arrest warrant for Barack Obama over charges of treason?,"But a claim that’s been making the rounds in the conservative blogosphere over the past few months is even more startling. It says that John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, has ordered Obama’s arrest for treason.The headline of the post says, ""BREAKING: Report Circulating That Justice John Roberts Signed Off On Obama’s Arrest For Treason.""The rest of the post is not exactly transparently sourced, citing ""serious speculation"" and an unlinked-to ""leaked document.""""There is some serious speculation that Chief Justice John Roberts has signed off on Interpol, which would mean that Obama is one step closer to being removed from office for multiple counts of treason,"" the post says. ""Charges include infringements of the Second Amendment, and declaring war without consent of Congress, and some other serious violations of Obama’s Oath.""Is there anything to this post? No, say legal experts, it’s entirely bunk. (The Supreme Court did not comment for this story, as is its general policy.)For starters, the phrase ""Chief Justice John Roberts has signed off on Interpol"" is not even ""coherent English, let alone a statement that makes any constitutional sense,"" said Stephen Wermiel, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law.Moreover, the powers of the chief justice are far more limited than this blog post imagines, Wermiel and other legal experts said.The chief justice ""has no authority to sign off on a warrant of any kind,"" said Paul Finkelman, a law professor at Albany Law School.About the only type of arrest the chief justice could set into motion would be to ""direct the sergeant at arms to remove a disruptive member of the audience"" at an oral argument in the Supreme Court building, said Kurt T. Lash, director of the program on constitutional theory, history and law at the University of Illinois.""It would be a serious violation of separation of powers for the court as a whole to involve itself"" in allegations of treason by the president, Lash said. ""In cases where the president might refuse to follow a lawful directive of the court -- say, a failure to turn over Oval Office tapes -- the court would simply report the matter to Congress for their consideration of impeachment. The court itself would take no action against the president.""If the House did proceed to impeach the president, the Senate would hold a trial -- and at that point, the chief justice would enter the picture, as the presiding officer over the trial in the Senate chamber. But that’s quite different than the scenario the blog post lays out, since the chief justice would be entering the fray at the final stage of a president’s possible removal, not as the official initiating it.""Given his longtime participation as an advocate before the Supreme Court before joining the bench, John Roberts would know this, as does pretty much everyone else,"" Lash said. The likelihood that this rumor is false, Lash said, ""is 100 percent.""Our rulingBloggers said Roberts ""signed off on Obama’s arrest for treason."" But even if he wanted to, the Constitution wouldn’t allow it. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,GOP spokesman says Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Barack Obama's executive orders 13 times,"House Speaker John Boehner’s threat to sue President Barack Obama is either a political stunt or a necessary course of action against an errant administration, depending on what side of the aisle you fall.""In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders,"" Spicer said.Spicer’s statement relies on the same incorrect premise as Goodlatte’s comment, and in fact takes it a step further. (In an email to PolitiFact, he also admitted that he ""misspoke in using the statistic."") Let's explain why.Goodlatte provided us a list of the cases he was referring to. We reviewed them, and enlisted the help of constitutional law experts to take a look as well.Bush’s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most of those instances.Obama’s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that’s commonplace, experts we spoke with said.But even that case had nothing to do with what Spicer said last weekend on CNN. Spicer claimed that the court has unanimously rejected ""the president's executive orders"" 13 times in three years.Executive orders are a lot different, and a lot more specific, than ""constitutional authority,"" which is what Goodlatte said. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope.It does not appear that any of these cases actually have to do with executive orders issued by Obama.In the case concerning the National Labor Relations Board, for example, the issue was the president’s power to make appointments. There was no executive order issued that named individuals to positions to the board.And again, most of these cases were started under Bush, so any executive action was likely coming from the previous administration, not Obama.Our rulingSpicer said, ""In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders.""Most of the litigation actually came in response to actions under the Bush administration. In the few cases initiated during Obama’s two terms, the court wasn't even ruling on challenges to Obama’s executive orders.Spicer took an already debunked argument and made another mistake in repeating it, so it was even more incorrect. We rate the statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Carter camp overstates Deal's education record,"The war of words in the governor’s race has been escalating.And it recently came to this: ""Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state,"" Matt McGrath, the campaign manager for Carter for Governor, said in a press release June 18.A fundraising email went out the next day, repeating that statement.In previous fact checks, we’ve noted the pitfalls to calling anything the most extreme, the first or, in this case, ""the worst."" The main problem: How do you prove that?In this case, Republican Nathan Deal, who faces Democrat state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta in the November general election, is Georgia’s 82nd governor. So when you talk about the worst governor in Georgia history, you are covering a lot of territory.Remember, the state began as a prison colony, and its first chief executive took office in 1775. The governors who followed presided over a state that made almost no attempt to educate poor whites, banned education for enslaved blacks, and aided and abetted the removal of Native American children and their parents to reservations in the West.Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia and a longtime Capitol observer, said the statement by McGrath is ""the kind of campaign rhetoric that is false on its face.""""Obviously, someone like Gene Talmadge who did three terms as governor did less for education than Nathan Deal,"" Bullock said. ""It used to be that the state’s budget went disproportionately for transportation; now most of it goes for education.""The overall budget for education is up $930 million in Deal’s tenure, when increases for pre-kindergarten and higher education are counted, according to the state Budget Office.So what about the Carter camp’s claim?We contacted Bryan Thomas, Carter’s campaign spokesman, to ask for supporting evidence. He told us the statement reflects the Carter campaign’s ""opinion."" He also said McGrath’s statement was aimed at Deal’s record on education funding, though that’s not what it says.Thomas made three points to us, all dealing with the austerity cuts to education that started under Gov. Sonny Perdue in 2003, increased to more than $1 billion a year in his final two years in office and have largely continued at that level under Deal. These cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985.Here are Thomas’ points, as well as some state data and our research..1). On average, Deal has underfunded k-12 education in Georgia by more than $1 billion per year since taking office. That’s true. Austerity cuts (and we’re rounding) were $1.15 billion in fiscal 2012, $1.14 billion in fiscal 2013, $1.06 billion in fiscal 2014 and $746.6 million for fiscal 2015, which began Tuesday, state records show.2.). After just four years in office, Deal is responsible for more than half of the total austerity cuts, or about $4.1 billion. Our research and state records show the austerity cuts total about $4.1 billion under Deal and $8.4 billion since the cuts started in 2003.3). Between fiscal 2003 (when ""austerity cuts"" began) and fiscal 2011 (when Deal took office) — a period encompassing the worst years of the Great Recession — the average QBE shortfall was just $380 million per year. Nathan Deal’s average has been more than 250 percent higher than that, at just over $1 billion per year. True. Austerity cuts in Deal’s tenure are averaging $1.02 billion a year. The cuts under Perdue were $134.9 million in fiscal 2003, $283.5 million in fiscal 2004, $332.8 million in fiscal 2005, $332.8 in fiscal 2006, $169.7 million in fiscal 2007, $143 million in 2008, $496 million in 2009, $1.4 billion in 2010 and $1.1 billion in 2011, with rounding.""Find me another governor who has so incredibly underfunded education according to the state’s own guidelines,"" Thomas said in an email.Jen Talaber, a spokeswoman for the Deal campaign, said: ""To be clear, the Carter campaign just said that Governor Deal had the ‘worst record in the history of the state’?""""The Carter campaign believes that segregationist governors had better records than Governor Deal?""Talaber said it’s important to recognize the economic conditions that existed when Deal took office.""The rainy day fund was in pitiful shape, mandated health care spending was increasing, and we were in the midst of the Great Recession,"" she said. ""In spite of that, the governor increased education funding every year he’s been in office.""Carter voted for Deal’s budget every year, except for the fiscal 2015 budget this year, Talaber said. (This is something Deal’s campaign ads point out.)Talaber said the governor ""believes a strong education builds a strong economy"" and has backed school choice, working for passage of the 2012 charter school amendment. His record on education also includes championing or implementing a plan to increase schools’ access to the Internet, educator training in reading and other best practices, and the health education program SHAPE, Talaber said.Deal also saved the popular lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-kindergarten programs from the brink of bankruptcy, she said. (Some of the HOPE changes that ultimately were approved were brokered by a bipartisan group that included Carter.)So with the perspective of both camps, we reached out to Thomas V. O’Brien, chairman of the department of educational studies and research at the University of Southern Mississippi, for help with the long view of Deal in history. O’Brien has researched American education in the 20th century and published a book in 1999, ""The Politics of Race and Schooling: Public Education in Georgia, 1890-1961.""He said he believes that because of the governor’s funding cuts to education and his stance on school choice, ""it is fair to say that Deal is no friend to public education.""But a declaration of worst is problematic, O’Brien said.In the 1950s and 1960s, Govs. Herman Talmadge, S. Marvin Griffin and, for a time, Ernest Vandiver threatened to do away with the public schools if they were forced to integrate by race.""They also led the Georgia Legislature to put in place laws that would facilitate such actions,"" he said. ""However, most of their concrete actions that took hold, initiated by Talmadge, were not to cut dollars for public ed, but rather to invest in public education under the ‘separate but equal’ doctrine (Plessy vs. Ferguson, 1896).""The strategy to avoid token desegregation did not work, and, when pushed, the segregationist state leadership under Vandiver kept the public schools and repealed most of the massive resistance legislation, O’Brien said.Thirty-eight Georgia governors served before the Civil War, when there was no public education to speak of, O’Brien said. It was against the law in most places to teach a slave to read, write or do math. Poor whites had no schools, and wealthy whites brought in tutors or sent their children to school in Europe or the North, he said.So where does this leave us?The Carter camp issued a statement saying ""Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state."" Spokesman Bryan Thomas later said the camp was referring to his record on education funding and specifically pointed to austerity cuts during his administration. Annual austerity cuts topped $1 billion in his first three budgets, but also were that high in the last two budgets of his predecessor, Sonny Perdue.The Carter camp can’t prove that among Georgia’s 82 governors Deal’s record is the worst on education in general or on education funding in specific.The Carter campaign’s charge was incendiary -- that the sitting governor has the worst education record in Georgia’s history. And we smell smoke.We award it our lowest rating, Pants On Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Limbaugh says Obama administration planned the influx of children at the border,"In a news conference, Boehner faulted President Barack Obama.""You tell me this is not purposeful,"" Limbaugh said. ""Listen. Six months ago, the regime began planning how to transport tens of thousands of undocumented children from the border.""""On Jan. 29, they knew,"" Limbaugh said. ""Somebody had advance knowledge that these thousands of undocumented children would be flooding the border ... All these kids were planned in advance to show up.""The story behind the estimateIn November 2013, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops sent a delegation to Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to get a better understanding of why unaccompanied children were flooding America’s southern border. Jeanne Atkinson, director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, went on that trip and met with two Homeland Security officials stationed in the region.""The numbers are not pulled out of a hat,"" Atkinson told PunditFact. ""Based on looking at past years and the daily numbers, we knew it was an estimate but it seemed like a reasonable estimate.""A rising trend lineThe data in the graph are for fiscal years which end in September. The 2014 data does not include the entire year. The point is, in the fall of 2013, anyone looking at the situation would be seeing steep increases.W. Ralph Basham was commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009. Basham told PunditFact that the government estimates in 2013 follow established practice. He said people should remember they are based on more than just the numbers.""The Border Patrol interview these people on the border,"" Basham said. ""When they hear what's going on the ground in these countries and why these people are leaving, they start to put the numbers together. They are always looking at trends to prepare themselves to deal with these surges. Unfortunately, this time it got ahead of them.""Basham said he finds it ""hard to buy the notion that the administration planned this."" He said the situation on the border stems from a ""perfect storm"" of rampant violence, sometimes by gangs, in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, limited capacity in this country to quickly send these children home and a belief in Central America that if you get over the border, you can stay in America.Atkinson with the conference of Catholic bishops said she has heard first-hand accounts of the threats to children, including gang members seizing teenage girls from their homes.""These mothers and grandmothers told me, ‘Do you think we would send them away if we had any other option?’ "" Atkinson said.Basham said the governments in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras need to contain this violence but so far, they’ve been unable to.Our rulingIn reality, the rising number of unaccompanied children arriving at the border was well established by the end of 2013. Catholic relief workers and a past Homeland Security commissioner said all the data pointed to a continued increase into 2014. Many of the factors behind the surge of children lie outside the control of the administration. No expert we reached gave any credence to the idea that the administration planned this crisis on the border.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE," In Democratic Party video ad, Scott Walker nods yes when asked if he’s part of ‘criminal scheme’","Five days after an unsealed legal brief spelled out John Doe prosecutors’ suspicions that Gov. Scott Walker helped run a ""criminal scheme"" to violate campaign laws, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin posted a web video.Benson, not shown at first, is heard saying to Walker: ""...that you are the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?""Abruptly, the audio goes out, the video goes to slow motion, and Walker nods his head up and down with eyes closed and sort of a grim look on his face.""Our State Deserves Better"" appears on the screen as the video ends without any verbal evidence of Walker’s response to Benson.Tale of the tapeAt the bottom of the screen during the sequence with Benson and Walker, the video credit appears to be WEAU-TV, the NBC affiliate in Eau Claire. The station picked up the feed from WTMJ and aired it June 20.But the report originally aired on WTMJ, so we looked at the station’s segment regarding the release of the prosecution’s brief and Walker’s reaction.In the WTMJ segment, anchors introduce the story and then go to Benson, who says, ""Well, the new documents are public after conservative groups sued in Federal Court to stop the investigation. Prosecutors allege a criminal scheme. Walker says the allegations from a partisan Milwaukee D.A. are false.""After showing some highlights of the prosecution’s theory of the case, the segment cuts to Benson questioning Walker. It’s the complete version of the sequence truncated by the Dems in their video.The first tipoff to the fact that the Dem video is manipulated: In the WTMJ segment, unlike in the Dem video, Benson is on screen when he asks Walker: ""Prosecutors in the John Doe investigation allege that you are at the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?""""No,"" Walker says immediately, shaking his head side to side. The WTMJ segments cuts away at that point, back to Benson, who says: ""Walker says no laws were broken, and the case was rejected by two judges who have reviewed the allegations.""Finally, WTMJ cuts back to the reporters interviewing Walker, who is shown saying, ""And I asked people to look at the facts, and the facts are pretty clear. A judge at the state and the federal level made it clear that they didn’t buy into this argument. They said to move on.""It doesn’t take a degree in YouTube to see that Walker actually bobbed his head ""yes"" during Benson’s question, not in response to Benson. (As those who follow Walker know, he uses the head bob frequently when listening to people as he campaigns or when taking in reporters’ questions.)We asked Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Mike Tate about the discrepancy between the two videos.Tate referred us to party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, who acknowledged that it appears Walker shakes his head yes in the party’s video.It wasn’t intentional or an attempt to mislead, Baldauff said. The party was trying to ""layer together clips"" of news coverage of the Doe issue and about the jobs reports that came out the same week, she said.Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson wasn’t buying that explanation Friday.""This Democrat Party propaganda is another attempt to mislead the voters from the facts and distract from Mary Burke's failed record as Jim Doyle's commerce secretary,"" Evenson said, referring to Walker’s leading Democratic Party challenger in the fall governor’s race.WTMJ news director Janet Hundley and WEAU general manager Terry McHugh assisted PolitiFact in locating video of the Walker segment. Neither wanted to comment on the Dem video.Our ratingA Democratic Party web video making the rounds on social media shows a grim-faced Gov. Scott Walker appearing to bob his head yes to a reporter’s question about whether he was at the center of a ""criminal scheme"" to evade campaign finance laws.In real life, the governor answered an emphatic ""no"" --  not surprising given he’s been denying any wrongdoing since new documents were released in the John Doe investigation.The Dem video, in its editing of the WTMJ clip, leaves the viewer with the misleading and ridiculous impression that Walker is somehow admitting guilt in the case.That’s the definition of Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Fox's Doocy: NASA fudged data to make the case for global warming,"""That's the hottest year on record in the United States,"" Doocy said. ""At least until NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming. The 1930s were by far the hottest decade in the United States.""A reader wondered if NASA really did cook the books (we love reader suggestions!), so we are checking Doocy’s claim about fudging the numbers.""Right after the year 2000, NASA and NOAA dramatically altered U.S. climate history, making the past much colder and the present much warmer,"" Goddard wrote.He provided this animated chart to prove his point (the chart marked ""a"" is the old version):Climate science experts say not so fastDoocy exaggerated the findings in this blog post when he applied it to global warming. The post itself only talks about U.S. land temperatures and what happens in the United States is separate from global shifts.As far as what the blog actually claimed, while it accurately copied the changes in the government charts, experts in U.S. temperature measurement say it ignores why the charts shifted. There were major changes in how the country gathered temperature information over the decades.""He is simply averaging absolute temperatures,"" Hausfather wrote. ""Absolute temperatures work fine if and only if the composition of the station network remains unchanged over time.""Weather stations that once were in a valley might now be on a hill top and vice versa. But the shift could be greater than simple elevation. Stations were moved from one part of a state to another. The number of stations within a given area shifted. All these differences, Hausfather and other experts said, will alter the typical temperatures gathered by government meteorologists.Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said the raw data used in the blog post suffered from an equally troubling flaw. The temperatures were not measured at the same time of day.""Over time, the U.S. network went from recording max/min temperatures at different points of the day, to doing it at midnight,"" Schmidt said.Comparing apples to applesBetter instruments and more consistent methods have allowed scientists to collect more reliable data. But for climate studies, long-term trends are key and the challenge has been how to make the best use of the older readings.There is no question that running the raw data through these programs changes the graphs of average temperatures. However, multiple researchers from a variety of institutions have fed into this process and come up with their own computer models. Results from different teams largely match up.John Nielsen-Gammon is a researcher at Texas A&M University and is the Texas state climatologist. Nielsen-Gammon finds nothing nefarious in the government analysis of temperature trends.""It is reasonable to expect the adjusted data record to change over time as the technology for identifying and removing artificial changes improves,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. ""If there are any biases, they are caused by the quality of the underlying data, not by any biases intentionally introduced into the adjustment process.""All of the experts we reached or whose work we read rejected Goddard’s conclusions.Mark  C. Serreze, professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said no fabrication has taken place.""Goddard's results stem from an erroneous analysis of the data,"" Serreze said.Anthony Watts, a popular skeptic of most climate change data, posted his objection to Goddard’s claim.""I took Goddard to task over this as well in a private email, saying he was very wrong and needed to do better,"" Watts wrote.Our rulingDoocy with Fox News said NASA scientists fudged the numbers to overstate the extent of global warming. This exaggerated the thrust in the underlying blog post. It accused government scientists of altering the U.S. temperature record, not the record for the entire earth.As for what the blog said, we found that experts across the spectrum found fundamental flaws in its analytic methods. By relying on raw data, it ignored that the number and location of weather stations and the methods of measuring temperatures across the United States have changed greatly over the past 80 years.The experts we reached or whose work we read generally agree that the corrections for flawed data produce valid results. The bare bones approach used in the blog post provides no solution to the issues of weaknesses in the raw data.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Video of Barack Obama speech circulating on the Internet was edited to change his meaning,"The chain email that included the link to the video said, ""You may not believe this 20 second sound bite. I had to listen to it twice ... to be sure that I heard what I thought I had heard. This is the most amazing statement ever uttered by Obama, or by any American.""The brief video showed Obama giving a speech in which he said, ""And for the international order that we have worked for generations to build, ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign.""It’s unclear whether the video was posted seriously or in jest by the German group; the emoticon ""^^"" sometimes communicates sarcasm. Still, that doesn’t play into our fact-check, because what we’re checking here is how the video circulated in English in the United States -- where there was no indication that it was intended as satire.Here’s the actual context of Obama’s comments:Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states.  And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge: The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose. The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.  And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal.In other words, the creator of the video slyly spliced together two separate passages of Obama’s speech during a cut-away shot -- in a way that totally changes the meaning. Obama wasn’t saying that ""ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs"" or that individuals should ""surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign."" Rather, he was saying that those two sentiments run counter to the ideals of free will and democracy.Our rulingThe chain email claims that Obama said that ""ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs"" and that individuals should ""surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign."" Those are two separate thoughts from an actual speech, spliced together through video editing in a way that twists Obama’s argument beyond recognition. We rate it Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,Perry airs unsupported claim about non-Mexicans apprehended at border hailing from terrorist states,"On the ""Fox & Friends"" program, Gov. Rick Perry bemoaned record-high apprehensions of individuals not from Mexico near the nation’s southern border. Perry then said: ""These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations.""Is Perry also right that all these apprehended immigrants not from Mexico hail from countries with substantial ties to terrorist regimes and operations?While nearly everyone detained near the border was a Mexican national, Cornyn showed that in the cited period, there were 153 apprehensions of Cubans, 17 of Iranians, seven of Sudanese and two of Syrians. That fact check noted, too, that while an ""apprehension"" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally,  the number of people actually detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once.When we sought backup for Perry’s 2014 statement, state officials offered no figures. After Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said by email Perry drew on information from the Texas Department of Public Safety, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger replied to us by email: ""On a regular basis, undocumented immigrants from countries with ties to or which sponsor terrorism are being apprehended by Border Patrol."" He later named Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan as such countries, adding that the department had no further response.Terrorist states, safe havensCountries of originAnd how many of the individuals stopped after crossing the border are coming from those countries? We were unable to come up with up-to-date data.Countries with most immigrants removed from U.S.Analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that seeks to reduce immigration, helped us see another way to probe this topic by turning to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency within Homeland Security responsible for deporting people not legally authorized to be in the United States. ICE published a report and chart in December 2013 showing no countries outside the Western Hemisphere ranked among the top 10 countries of origin for immigrants returned to home countries by the U.S. government in the 12 months that ran through September of that year. Alone among them, Colombia is one of the U.S.-designated terrorist havens.In the period, the agency said, ""Mexico continued to be the leading country of origin for those removed"" from the United States, ""followed by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.""Removed Population by Citizenship*October 2012 through September 2013CitizenshipTotalMexico241,493Guatemala47,769Honduras37,049El Salvador21,602Dominican Republic2,462Ecuador1,616Brazil1,500Colombia1,429Nicaragua1,383Jamaica1,119Top 10 Total357,422 *This counts individuals caught near border and beyondSource: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, December 2013 (accessed June 19, 2014)According to the report, the government removed 90,461 people from countries other than Mexico who had been caught by the Border Patrol after crossing the border--a 27 percent increase from the year before. Around the country, overall, ICE removed 368,644 individuals, the report said.Put another way, the top 10 countries--all but Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica located in Central and South America--accounted for 97 percent of the foreigners removed.By email, Vaughan said her search of an ICE database covering 2013 yielded ""a handful of cases of aliens who had been arrested by the Border Patrol who were citizens of countries linked to terrorism and had crossed the border illegally from Mexico recently.  There were 2 from Nigeria, 3 from Pakistan, 1 from Egypt, 1 from Morocco and 1 from Afghanistan,"" she wrote. ""All were between the ages of 26 and 50.""Generally, Vaughan said, ""some"" border crossers detained by the Border Patrol originated in terrorist states. By phone, she said the majority of OTM apprehensions have long involved people from Central America.""Apprehensions of nationals from potential terrorist nations are not increasing,"" Massey said.Our rulingSpeaking of a flood of immigrants from countries other than Mexico being apprehended at the U.S-Mexico border, Perry said, ""These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations.""The latest available data show that less than 5 percent of ""other than Mexican"" apprehensions in the last two completed federal fiscal years involved people from U.S.-designated terrorist states or safe havens. Perry, in contrast, placed all such people being apprehended by U.S. border officials into that category, a conclusion neither the governor or the agency described as his source backed up with evidence.We rate this claim as Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Does Obama have a 'dog-trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense'?","Here, we’ll check the claim that Obama is paying a pretty penny in taxpayer money -- specifically $102,000 a year -- to keep a dog trainer on retainer. The White House didn't respond to our inquiry, but we were able to piece the story together on our own.It’s obvious that the family adores Bo, but do they spend more than $100,000 per year to have a dog handler at their beck and call?But this wasn’t enough to stop pieces of the rumor from morphing into another outrageous claim about Bo.But Love was far from a dog trainer. His job was to provide any necessary personal assistance and arrangements for the leader of the Free World. The notion that Obama was keeping a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year is nonsense.However, according to the ""Annual Reports to Congress on White House Staff,"" she was never paid by the Obama administration.Our RulingThe chain email said that ""Obama is the first president to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense.""

Meanwhile, Reggie Love was an Obama aide who earned $102,000, but to the extent that dog handling took any of his time, it was a small fraction of his total duties, and ""dog handler"" certainly wasn’t his title.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chain email falsely says Barack Obama is 'first president to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect',"But there are several problems with the claim.What does the president swear to protect?There’s nothing in there about protecting the states. Rather, the president is charged with protecting the Constitution of the United States. Sometimes states act in ways that contradict the U.S. Constitution (or federal laws), and when they do, the president’s administration is expected to challenge those states in court. It’s up to the judicial branch to decide whether the states or the federal government is right in that case.""The federal government does sue states, either to enforce federal law or to enforce the Constitution, and it’s not that uncommon,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.Who files the lawsuits?When the federal government sues a state (or anyone), the lawsuit is almost always filed by a federal department or agency, rather than by the president personally.Is Obama really the first president to sue states?This is the laughable part of the claim.But the Justice Department isn’t the only federal agency to sue states -- lots of other federal agencies also bring enforcement actions against states through lawsuits. In some cases, the targets are states or state-run entities.A different claim than the one made in the email might have some validity -- that the Obama administration may be suing states more frequently, or on different and ""bigger"" issues. But even here, numerical proof is elusive.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said it’s logical to assume that Democratic administrations may be more likely to file lawsuits to enforce federal laws than Republican administrations do, since a core tenet of Republican philosophy is a distaste for ""big government.""""It sure seems like this administration does it a lot, and that Democrats would do it more than Republicans,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He added, however, that on the email’s specific claim, ""it doesn't strike me as unusual for the federal government to sue states to enforce federal law, particularly voting rights and environmental regulations.""Our ruling"

Bowe Bergdahl.He is not and there is no way that he could be.For starters, the five Taliban officials were released May 31, 2014, more than two months after the image was first released.How'd things get mixed up?Without using Mohammed Fazl’s name, Nugent apparently borrowed much from such posts. Fazl is a former Taliban deputy defense minister, one of the five men released from Guantanamo. Mohammed Fazl (left) and Abdurahman (right).We contacted Nugent’s office for comment and did not hear back.Our rulingNugent said a man squatting behind five heads had been set free by President Barack Obama to secure the freedom of an American soldier. The photo first appeared in mid March, two months before the prisoner swap.Nugent had plenty of opportunity to learn that the photo was not of one of the five released prisoners. He posted it two days after the connection to the Guantanamo detainees had been debunked.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine among 46 ""legistraitors"" in the U.S. Senate who voted to let the United Nations seize the guns of Americans.""Folks: This needs to go viral,"" the email said. ""These Senators voted to let the UN take OUR guns. They need to lose their next election. We have been betrayed.""A reader recently sent us the dispatch and asked if it is true. We took a look, mindful that Warner, a Democrat, is up for reelection this fall.Facts about the treatyIt requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take ""appropriate measures"" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps.The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons.What about the email’s contentions that the treaty would ""let the U.N. take OUR guns,"" and ""implement and international gun registry ... on all guns and private ammo?""There are no provisions for any of that in the treaty. To the contrary, the pact’s preamble affirms ""the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system.""Our rulingA chain email says Warner and Kaine were among 46 senators who voted to ""let the U.N. take our guns.""This is a wild distortion of the senators’ support for a U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that has no enforcement power but encourages nations to adopt common standards to block the flow of arms into nations beset by terrorists or dictators with brutal human rights records. The goal is to raise the international arms trade rules to standards already used by the United States.The treaty explicitly recognizes the sovereign rights of nations to control gun laws within its borders. So the assertion that the U.N. would be empowered to take guns from United States citizens is outlandish.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Did Barack Obama sign a bill to forgive all outstanding student debt? No,"Sometimes art mirrors real life so closely that it’s hard to tell the two apart.That announcement followed the introduction of a Senate Democratic bill that would aid borrowers in two ways. The bill would allow students with existing debt to refinance to the interest rate new borrowers can get -- 3.86 percent. The bill also offers an option to refinance private student loans into the federal student-loan system.Right around the same time, debt-laden Americans were noticing chain emails and social media posts with a headline that offered something even bolder -- ""Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt.""""Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Obama signed a new federal bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt because of the high interest rates and outrageous balances caused by college loans."" ‘Any student, past or present, who has taken loans from the federal government within the last 10 years to pay for higher education, will no longer be required to pay back those loans,’ said President Obama. ‘This forgiveness also is to be extended to any student currently enrolled in college, who may need financial assistance for the next several years as they finish their degrees.’ ""If you’re a student with a lot of debt, this sounds great. But it’s too good to be true.Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, phasing out just one fifth of the student debt total each year for five years -- $200 billion a year -- would mean adding an annual outlay equal to today’s combined budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor and Transportation.The article’s focus on student loans gains some believability from Obama’s long association with the topic.Our rulingEmails and social media posts are circulating a claim that ""Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt."" But while Obama has taken executive action and called for passage of a student-loan refinancing bill now pending in the Senate, he didn’t say he was planning to forgive all student debts -- a far more massive undertaking. The claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire. "

He added that Block, who ""has frankly been a strong critic, pointing out in speeches and in radio interviews how devastating it has been to his business.""While we were waiting for information from the Fung campaign seeking the source of its claim, we examined a new flier from Fung’s campaign that made a slightly different claim about Block's support for Obamacare. It shows a green-faced Block, along with Gov. Lincoln Chafee, depicted as ""Two Peas in a Pod"" because both ""have been cheerleaders for liberal agendas.""""Both supported Obamacare,"" it asserts, characterizing Block's support in the past tense.So where's the truth?Four minutes into that program, Block states that he has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, including President Obama in 2012.""In 2012, I bought what Barack Obama was selling in terms of changes to health care for me as a small business owner, someone who buys insurance for employees. I can no longer afford to do what we're doing. And I believed that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was going to provide the kind of relief that we needed in my business to insure my employees,"" he says.""And it turns out that the promise didn't live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote,"" Block continued. ""I'm looking for answers and those answers didn't come.""In other words, Block acknowledged in November that he did support the promise of Obamacare, signed into law in March 2010, and Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated that he no longer supports that law.He said it ""raised taxes and massively disrupted the health insurance market in Rhode Island without increasing competition, access, or affordability.""He noted that the Fung ad clipped out Block's phrase, ""The promise didn’t live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote."" Fung said he didn't have a problem with the omission.Despite this, the ""Blockhead"" commercial says ""Block supports Obamacare,"" asserting that he supports the controversial health care law today.When the Fung campaign got back to us, spokesmen Patrick Sweeney and Robert Coupe argued that it is accurate to say that Block supports Obamacare today because Block has never called for repeal of the law, as other opponents have and has never formally revoked the support he acknowledged in the November ""Newsmakers"" appearance.On the latter point, we disagree. Block has repeatedly made it clear he no longer supports Obamacare. The very ""Newsmakers"" appearance the Fung campaign cites in its attack on Block shows that."
PANTS-FIRE,"Laura Ingraham says Eric Cantor and Luis Gutierrez ""toured the country"" for immigration reform","Dave Brat recently brought some right-wing firepower to his campaign to unseat U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor in the 7th District Republican primary on Tuesday.Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio talk show host, headlined a June 3 rally for Brat at Henrico County’s Dominion Club and quickly brought up immigration.She noted that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., held a May 28 rally in Richmond and urged Cantor to allow the House to vote on immigration reforms. Cantor, the House majority leader, has blocked votes on a comprehensive immigration bill and an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they’ve served.Cantor has signaled, however, that he might support a narrowly drawn bill establishing a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That’s spurred Brat to label Cantor weak on immigration and claim the majority leader is quietly working on a deal with Gutierrez to pass reforms. Brat said Gutierrez’s appearance in Virginia was designed to bolster Cantor’s credentials as tough on immigration prior to the GOP primary.Ingraham picked up that note, saying the immigration rally was ""beautifully choreographed."" She likened Cantor and Gutierrez to a touring ""Simon and Garfunkel in the 70s.""  Ingraham said of the two politicians, ""They’re touring the country last year talking ‘How to Make Life Work’ -- some ridiculous, meaningless titled tour -- joined at the hip, working together, in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform.""The Cantor-Gutierrez national immigration tour was news to us.

""No, they had no meetings on immigration and no, they never talked prior to Mr. Gutierrez coming to Richmond to attack Eric Cantor for stopping the Senate’s comprehensive immigration plan. And yes, despite what the Left says, we believe it is an amnesty plan.""Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, said while the Illinois congressman sat in on Cantor’s speech in New York, Gutierrez only attended about 12 hours of the three-day immigration pilgrimage.Rivlin also said his office checked the congressman’s schedule and found Gutierrez ""has never once had a meeting with Majority Leader Eric Cantor on any issue, including immigration.""Rivlin also said that beyond the ""Becoming America Pilgrimage,"" he’s not aware of any other immigration-related events that Gutierrez and Cantor both attended.We asked Ingraham’s executive producer if, beyond the New York event, she could name other immigration functions Cantor and Gutierrez attended. She came up empty.Our rulingIngraham said Cantor and Gutierrez were ""touring the country last year … joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform.""Cantor and Gutierrez were among 100 leaders who attended a pilgrimage to the New York City area last July that focused on immigration issues. Aides say that’s the only immigration event Cantor and Gutierrez both happened to attend and that the two lawmakers have never met to discuss immigration.One event in New York does not make a national tour.

This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again,"" the posts quotes Bachmann as saying on Fox News on May 28.But no, she did not remember iconic American Ben Franklin as a past president. Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, served as the nation’s first postmaster general and later as U.S. ambassador to France. But he was never president.A search of transcripts and news stories for the quote came up dry.Bachmann spokesman Dat Kotman said she did not even appear on Fox that day, and we could not find any evidence that she did.Bachmann alluded to a painting by Howard Chandler Christy of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, which hangs in a stairway in the Capitol’s House wing.

PANTS-FIRE,Chain email falsely claims Obama is only president not to visit D-Day monument,"Off and on for several years, readers have been sending us a chain email that claims, among other things, that President Barack Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has failed to visit France’s D-Day Monument on D-Day.In addition to the claims about Obama, the email also makes false statements about the D-Day anniversary celebrations in Normandy and the number of American forces involved in the battle. The email is fairly lengthy, so we’ll break it down into parts.Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has not visited the D-Day Monument on D-Day. The email claims that since the D-Day invasion in 1944, the United States ""has only four times not been there to do the honors."" The language of the email is ambiguous, but we will assume it is referring to ""there"" as the D-Day Monument in Normandy, rather than also including the monuments in the United States and Britain.Every year the French have a four-day celebration in Normandy complete with American uniforms, tanks, jeeps and guns. The email is largely correct in stating that the French host a celebration in Normandy every year, but it is not necessarily 4 days long.D-Day was ""the largest invasion ever attempted, where 200,000 Americans stormed the beaches at Normandy"" and 6,000 soldiers died.Roughly 156,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on D-Day, but only 73,000 of those were Americans, not 200,000, as the email states.Our rulingThe chain email said that Barack Obama is the only American president who has not visited the D-Day Monument in Normandy on D-Day.This long-circulating email was always wrong -- presidents Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama himself had indeed visited the monument in Normandy on D-Day -- but it’s especially wrong now, with Obama scheduled to visit the monument again on D-Day 2014, making him the only president to visit it twice on D-Day.

PANTS-FIRE,"Claim that solar panels drain the sun’s energy is satire, not science","Recently, several readers -- feeling depressed after reading that a promising type of clean, renewable energy was seemingly weakening the earth’s very life force -- asked us to check a claim circulating on social media that ""solar panels drain the sun’s energy.""Rest easy, readers: The claim stems from a bit of satire being passed along by the scientifically gullible.""This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.""‘Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,’ WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. ‘Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.’""WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. ‘Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.’""However, people passing along this story by email appear not to be aware that the National Report is a satire site.We checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren’t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum.""The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn’t care less about your puny solar panel,"" said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development.Our rulingAs is often the case, what you see on social media isn’t accurate.

PANTS-FIRE,Rumors of third Barack Obama term are satire passed off as truth,"Who says President Barack Obama -- facing weak approval ratings, a tough midterm election and growing outrage over problems in veterans’ health care facilities -- is in the dumps? He’s headed to a third term! Or at least that’s the claim now bouncing around the Internet.The article with a Washington dateline began, ""President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term.""It went on to quote Obama at a press conference saying,""‘I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever. We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting.""The article then quoted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., telling CNN that he opposes Obama’s decision. ""This defies everything the Constitution stands for,"" Paul is quoted as saying. ""We can not let this man have a third term.""The problem facing Obama, according to the article, is the 22nd Amendment, which prevents presidents from running for more than two terms. It was ratified in 1951.However, the article suggests that Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has ""recently introduced"" a measure to abolish the 22nd Amendment -- which is ""exactly the kind of news that makes an Obama 2016 Presidential run possible.""The article closes with a comment from Paul Horner, purportedly an administration spokesman.""Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016 and then we’ll all be able to enjoy this great man for another four years,"" the article quotes ""Horner"" as saying. ""Things could not get any better for the American people. I’m so stoked!""So is Obama really going to get around the Constitution to run for a third term?Nope.In fact, people passing along this story by email appear not to have noticed that it comes from a satire site called the National Report.These earlier chain emails tended to focus on the amendment by Serrano. The National Report satire piece is correct to say that Serrano has introduced such legislation, but it’s hardly as recent a development as the article suggests.""I introduce it as a matter of principle,"" Serrano told FactCheck.org. ""I do not believe there should be term limits for any elected official. Elections should be the deciding factor. I do not receive advice or support on this bill from the White House or any other source.""We asked a White House spokesman if he wanted to comment. He politely declined.Our rulingA chain email now circulating links to an article headlined, ""Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run."" The article comes from a satire website, and even if Obama wanted to do an end run around the constitutional prohibition, the vehicle to do it -- Serrano’s bill -- has no hope of passage, much less any chance of ratification in three quarters of the states.

PANTS-FIRE,Guilfoyle: Obamacare is 'one big fat VA',"When a Fox News panelist described the VA as a ""single-payer"" system (where the financing of health care is run through the government), co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle chimed in.""If he (Obama) shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare,"" Guilfoyle said.Using the same logic, co-host Eric Bolling later claimed that 500 people per year ""are going to die waiting"" for treatment because of Obamacare.Bolling’s claim has some fundamental problems -- we’ll address them in a bit -- but here we’re fact-checking Guilfoyle’s claim that Obamacare amounts to ""one big fat VA system.""Obamacare: One big fat VA systemThe VA owns hospitals. Its doctors, nurses and technicians are government employees. The people who get care at VA facilities have served in the armed forces. These facilities are not open to the general public, and Congress appropriates the funds that keep the VA running.Under the Affordable Care Act, the government works with private insurance companies and health care providers to provide health care coverage. The government subsidizes insurance premiums for some people and sets minimum standards for insurance policies.But the health care system remains in the private sector. Private sector providers get paid by insurance companies and patients. There are thousands of private providers and hundreds of insurance plans operating in hundreds of markets across the country.In the case of Medicaid, the government plays the role of the insurance company and pays private providers based on a set reimbursement schedule.Some notes about the Affordable Care Act:Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies.The government has not seized control of hospitals or nationalized doctors.The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers.We asked health care experts to assess the similarities and differences between the VA and the Affordable Care Act. The bottom line: it’s apples and oranges.Tom Buchmueller, who spent a year on Obama's Council of Economic Advisors and teaches at the University of Michigan, said he struggles to see any similarity at all. ""Coverage through the exchanges is private insurance,"" Buchmueller said. Tom Getzen at Temple University said the VA is much like the institution that the veterans were once part of. ""It’s an army,"" Getzen said. ""In contrast, Obamacare is a complex legislative creation (with) the exchanges, expanded Medicaid and regulation.""Getzen said, to call Obamacare the same as the VA ""is kind of like saying your farm program is a post office."" They both have government ties, but they’re fundamentally different and are operated differently. 500 people dying a year from ObamacareBolling took the comparison a step further, saying the sort of delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves under Obamacare, with 500 people dying a year as a result.""President Obama wanted to insure 40 million new people under Obamacare,"" Bolling said.At the VA, he continued, the typical veteran has 13 appointments each year. Bolling applied that to 40 million new patients.""You're talking 585 million visits, half a billion visits,"" Bolling said. ""If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting -- apples to apples.""Second, the experts we reached said veterans have very different needs than the general population. Part of the massive growth in the VA workload stemmed from disorders related to traumatic brain injury and from the lingering effects of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange. Bolling doubled or even tripled the number of doctor appointments of typical Americans, experts told us.Point being: The math Bolling used to reach his prediction is quite flawed.Our rulingGuilfoyle said Obamacare is ""one big fat VA system."" We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry. The law sets standards for insurance and health care providers and it subsidizes premiums. Washington does run the Medicaid insurance program but even under that program, it is paying private providers.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Lawmaker: Common Core testing company forces children to become 'as homosexual as they possibly can',"The Orlando conference was in March, but Think Progress posted a video clip of Zant on May 19, and the video then spread to other blogs.""Our new secretary of education in Florida recently appointed AIR to receive the $220 million contract for end-of-course exam testing and to prepare those tests. Please -- go on their website. Click the link to what they are doing with youth, and you will see what their agenda really is. They are promoting as hard as they can any youth that is interested in the LGBT agenda and even name it 2-S, which they define as having two spirits. The Bible says a lot about being double-minded. Van Zant encouraged listeners to research AIR, so we took him up on his suggestion and decided to check if AIR plans to ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can."" We contacted Van Zant’s office and asked him to provide evidence to support his claim and did not get a response.Here, we’ll explore Van Zant’s specific claim that a testing company was making the attempt.Common Core tests and AIRIn March, the state Department of Education announced that it would give a $220 million, 6-year contract to American Institutes for Research to develop and administer new accountability tests to replace Florida’s old testing system, the FCAT. The Washington-based nonprofit will develop tests aligned to the Florida Standards, the new education benchmarks based on the controversial Common Core State Standards.The new tests are expected to be ready for the 2014-15 school year. AIR has contracts to develop tests for about 10 states including Florida.When the state chose AIR, Common Core foes took aim at the testing company. The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition accused AIR of promoting a lesbian gay bisexual transgender ""lifestyle"", better known as LGBT, calling the choice of AIR ""completely unacceptable"":""Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old,"" Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. (Similar claims have been made by Common Core opponents in Utah and Tennessee.)AIR only provides those materials to entities that request them -- currently that includes federal government contracts. AIR has no such contracts with the state Department of Education or any Florida districts to provide LGBT materials. (AIR is in discussions with a couple of districts in other states.)""No entity in Florida has asked us to do LGBT work,"" AIR spokesman Larry McQuillan said.AIR describes its practice in this way:""AIR’s Health and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness.""AIR also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters.""We are not an advocacy group,"" McQuillan told PolitiFact in March. ""AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards.""A few standards include sexual orientationWe interviewed McQuillan about Van Zant’s comments and asked about what sort of material will be included on the tests.""It’s the state that decides what questions they want to ask,"" he said. ""Florida is truly in control.""Joe Follick, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, said the tests administered by AIR will only include English language arts and math.""Florida has always been and will continue to be committed to assessments that solely measure a student's knowledge of subject areas and critical thinking spelled out in the Florida Standards,"" Follick said in an email in response to our questions.Our rulingA firm hired to do Common Core testing in Florida will ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can,"" Van Zant said.The firm hired to do testing, AIR, separately provides information to entities that request it to help them assist LGBT students. Currently, the federal government accesses AIR’s information but the organization doesn’t have such a contract with the state of Florida or any Florida districts.We found no evidence that when AIR administers tests in Florida that the testing process will involve recruiting students to become gay.Van Zant takes a somewhat limited connection between the testing company and gay and lesbian issues and then blows it up into a wild claim that lacks evidence.We rate this Pants on Fire."

They took effect on Jan. 1, 2013.That may seem like a minor difference, but in this case, it makes all the difference.The law made permanent many of the Bush-era tax cuts, but it did raise some taxes that primarily hit upper-income taxpayers. That’s what the email is attempting to spotlight, but it does so in a way that introduces a host of inaccuracies.""Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%""The timing is wrong, but the numbers are correct.""Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%""Usually people think about income taxes and payroll taxes separately. But it’s not uncommon for tax experts to look at the combination of income and payroll taxes together, because they give a sense of the overall burden of direct taxation on individuals. That’s what the email did here.On Jan. 1, 2013, the top combined rate for the income and payroll tax went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent. The top combined rate to 43.4 percent due to an additional Medicare tax in Obamacare.So if you just look at the federal rate, the email overstates the current top rate.If you take state taxes into account, the email is closer, but still inaccurate. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that also receives funding from individual donors and foundations, has calculated 2013 combined tax rates for each state. The group found that the top marginal tax rate, averaged across all states, is 47.9 percent.Of course, any state taxes would have been imposed by state governments, and thus were not part of the Affordable Care Act. And this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison; to make the comparison fair, the initial tax rate would need to be adjusted upward for state and local taxes as well.""Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%""On Jan. 1, 2013, the capital gains tax rate went from 15 percent to 20 percent. The health care law took that up to 23.8 percent. So the email is high by more than 4 percentage points.""Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%""This next line would have been correct if the Bush tax cuts had expired the way they were initially supposed to. But the December 2012 deal ended up going with a top marginal tax rate of 20 percent on dividend income instead of the pre-Bush rate of 39.6 percent on dividend income. It rose to 23.8 percent due to Obamacare.So the final rate cited in the email is far higher than the current rate.""Estate tax went from 0% to 55%""Both ends of this claim are wrong. The estate tax was gradually wound down by the Bush-era tax cuts, disappearing entirely in 2010. For 2011 and 2012 it was reimposed at 35 percent, then raised to 40 percent on Jan. 1, 2013 as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" bill.""These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the affordable care act, aka Obamacare.""Most of these changes were passed as part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, which was enacted with bipartisan support. Facing expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would have meant a massive tax increase up and down the income scale, both parties felt compelled to strike a deal that neither side was really enthusiastic about.It’s also incorrect to say that these taxes were all raised by Obamacare. The health care law did add marginally to three of the five taxes -- 0.9 percentage points extra on the top payroll tax rate, and 3.8 percentage points higher for the capital gains and the dividends tax -- but the bulk of the increases came from the fiscal cliff deal. All told, less than a third of the actual increases in the taxes cited by the email came from Obamacare.Our rulingThe chain email said that ""no Republicans voted for"" recent hikes in the income tax, payroll tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax and estate tax, arguing that they ""were all passed under … Obamacare.""The email gets many things wrong, including the effective date of the increases and most of the rates, which are uniformly higher than the actual rates. Most obviously, the email is flat-out wrong when it blames Democrats, and Obamacare, exclusively for the increases. The bulk of the tax hikes stem from a different bill entirely -- the fiscal cliff bill, which received support from a large majority of Senate Republicans and a significant minority of House Republicans.This email is so riddled with errors -- and gets so few things correct -- that we rate it Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,"'Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women,' bloggers say","In the final days of Florida’s legislative session, some conservative blogs claimed that they had unearthed the ""real"" war on women -- a war being waged by Democrats.The article said that elements of Sharia law include women being barred from voting, forced marriages for young girls, stoning to death of adulterous women and a requirement that women wear burqas -- the full-body clothing required of women in some very traditional Islamic societies -- when in public.What the bill was aboutAt root of the Florida issue is a dispute between a Tampa Islamic center and some of its ousted trustees. In making a ruling on the case in March 2011, a circuit court judge cited Islamic law, sparking outcry from conservatives. That month, two Republican state lawmakers, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, announced they would push for a bill to ban foreign law in Florida courts.The bill doesn’t specifically mention Sharia law, and it doesn’t outright ban the use of Sharia law, said Eduardo Palmer, a Coral Gables lawyer who serves on the legislative committee of the Florida Bar’s international law section. But much of the discussion centered on Sharia law.The bill only applies to family-law cases, including divorce, child support and child custody. It doesn’t apply to other areas of law, such as corporate matters.The bill states ""A court may not enforce: (a) A choice of law provision in a contract selecting the law of a foreign country which contravenes the strong public policy of this state or that is unjust or unreasonable. ... The purpose of this section is to codify existing case law, and that intent should guide the interpretation of this section.""The law allows a judge to agree to apply foreign law as long as it doesn’t contradict public policy in the U.S. For example, if a couple signed a prenuptial agreement in Argentina and later gets a divorce in Florida, a Miami judge could decide to apply Argentina’s law in the divorce case here, Palmer said. But if a foreign law violated our public policy in the United States about child labor rules, for example, then a judge could reject it.""That is the universal standard that most civilized countries adhere to,"" Palmer said.In reality, the bill doesn’t change existing law, which already allowed judges such discretion.An earlier version would have been much more aggressive -- it would have raised the standards before a judge could have allowed the use of foreign law. A compromise essentially codified existing law.Legislators who voted against the bill argued that it was unnecessary and was tantamount to an attack on Muslims.Waldman called the bill ""a solution in search of a problem.""A Florida Senate staff analysis in April stated there were six states that currently had laws restricting foreign law in state courts: Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. (An amendment approved by Oklahoma voters that expressly banned Sharia law was ruled unconstitutional, prompting Legislatures to later go with the more generic ""foreign law."")As of May 6, Scott had not signed it into law yet and a spokesman said his office would review the bill.How common and controversial is the use of foreign law in Florida courts?International law experts told us it’s not unusual for foreign law to get used in Florida courts.""Foreign law is applied all the time, in various ways, and it is almost never controversial,"" said C. Ryan Reetz, a Miami lawyer and chair of the Florida Bar’s international section.For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements.""In addition, there is an entire body of law called 'conflict of laws' or 'choice of laws' that governs when the law of a different state or foreign country will be applied to one or more issues in the case,"" Reetz said. ""As in all other states, the Florida courts have developed a series of conflict of laws rules that address this question. This body of law dates back to the founding of our country, and it has been especially well-documented over the last 100 years.""""The Hillsborough case that is referred to was a contract case in which both parties chose shari'ah as the law,"" she said. ""And the court had to give it credence as the freely chosen legal rules by which the contract was to be interpreted. It was no different than if they had chosen German law, or Klingon law.""The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida opposed the bill, although spokesman Baylor Johnson said the final version ""has relatively little impact on existing law.""""Just like some folks think that tinfoil hats will protect you from the imaginary threat of aliens reading your thoughts, the ‘foreign law’ bill won’t protect against the imaginary threat of ‘Sharia law’ taking over Florida, because that threat isn’t real,"" Johnson said.Our rulingClaims like this one recently circulated on the internet: ""Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women.""Senate Democrats did vote against a bill that prohibits judges from applying foreign law in family-law cases if it contradicts United States public policy. In reality, though, the bill would have essentially codified existing practice. The bill didn’t single out Sharia law, and the United States Constiution still applies.It’s ridiculous -- beyond ridiculous, really -- to suggest that Senate Democrats forced on women such elements of Sharia law as burqa-wearing and stoning to death. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Are Mike Simpson and Nancy Pelosi politically aligned?,"We’ve seen plenty of Democrats called out for voting records that closely align with President Barack Obama and other party leaders. But it isn’t every day that a conservative super PAC claims that an eight-term Republican congressman is closely aligned with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.The Madison Action Fund is claiming just that, running an ad in Idaho linking GOP Rep. Mike Simpson to Pelosi, a frequent target of Republican ire.Here’s what the ad says:""How liberal is congressman Mike Simpson? Simpson voted with Nancy Pelosi to bail out Wall Street. That wasnt enough spending for Mike Simpson, so he joined Pelosi in voting to take more of your money to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes. Simpson also joined Pelosi in voting to regulate the sale of firearms.""Is Simpson a ""liberal""?Despite what the ad suggests, Simpson and Pelosi have very different voting records.Still, 29 percent isn’t nothing and some may say, if Simpson was a real conservative, he would vote with Pelosi 0 percent of the time.Simpson has voted with his party 95 percent of the time. Calling him a liberal and insinuating ideological coziness between him and Pelosi is simply inaccurate.Did Simpson and Pelosi both vote ""to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes""?This is an exaggeration. The Madison Action Fund’s ad cites a House vote from July 10, 2003. (You read that right — this happened 10 years ago.)On that day, the House of Representatives voted to pass an appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which included money for the National Institutes of Health.An amendment to the bill offered by then-Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sought to strip funding from five National Institutes of Health research grants. Toomey said one of those grants was a ""study on San Francisco's Asian prostitutes and masseuses.""Simpson voted against Toomey’s amendment. Pelosi (who represents San Francisco) did as well, and it narrowly failed.But Toomey’s description of the research grant might have warranted a ruling from the Truth-O-Meter were it around back then.The grant was awarded to the University of California San Francisco, the home of the AIDS Research Institute, and studied ways to reduce HIV risks among Asian women.Whether this research should have been selected for funding given the limited pool of money available is a reasonable question to debate, but saying it was to ""fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes"" fails to factor in the public-health concerns at stake.Did Simpson and Pelosi vote together ""to regulate the sale of firearms""?This claim goes even further back. The Madison Action Fund singles out Simpson’s votes on the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act, a 1999 bill that emerged in the aftermath of the Columbine High School shooting.Clinton called the vote ""a great victory for the NRA.""But it also included an amendment that was added to require safety locks to be sold with all handguns. The amendment had overwhelming bipartisan support, including from a majority of Republicans. Simpson voted for it, as did Pelosi, and it passed 311-115.The National Rifle Association ultimately urged Republicans to back the entire bill on final passage. Simpson followed the NRA’s lead and voted for the bill. Pelosi didn’t. And it failed 147-280.So ultimately, Simpson and Pelosi were mostly on opposite sides of the fight over this bill. Most importantly, when it came on votes to ""regulate the sale of firearms,"" Simpson voted to loosen restrictions while Pelosi wanted to maintain the status quo. They only voted on the same side on a measure to require safety locks on handguns.Our rulingThe ad cherry picks a handful of votes to create the impression that Simpson and Pelosi are in ideological lockstep. But the votes chosen are old, cherry-picked and deeply misleading. Suggesting any substantial alliance between Simpson and Pelosi is ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Rand Paul says 40 times more Kentuckians have gotten health-insurance cancellation notices than signed up for Obamacare,"Now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for coverage under Obamacare, the White House has all but declared victory after the law’s initially troubled rollout. But many of the law’s critics continue to see the law as a disaster.A reader sent us a newsletter to constituents released by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a critic of the law and a potential presidential candidate in 2016.Here’s an excerpt from the newsletter, which was dated May 2, 2014:The claim that leapt out at us was, ""For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."" Could that really be true? We took a look at the data.How many Kentuckians have received cancellation notices?So a reasonable number for cancellations in Kentucky is probably between 130,000 and 168,000.How many Kentuckians have signed up for Obamacare?The answer depends on your definition of ""Obamacare.""Comparing the two numbersUsing just these numbers, Paul is either wrong or very wrong.The smaller number -- private-insurance number of signups (82,795) -- is exceeded by the number of cancellations (up to 168,000), but at most, the discrepancy is only twice as big, not 40 times as big.But it’s not clear that this is the right number to use. Paul’s newsletter didn’t only refer to private plans, and the Medicaid expansion was just as much a part of Obamacare as the marketplaces for private health insurance plans.So if you include both types of signups (413,410), then the combined Medicaid and private-insurance signups in Kentucky actually exceeded the number of cancellations by more than double. So Paul’s claim is not just off-base, it’s actually going in the opposite direction.In fact, the 40-times-higher claim is ridiculously off-base.If you take the smallest possible number of signups (82,795, counting just the new private plans) and multiply it by 40, you’d need more than 3.3 million cancellations to make the math work.Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the number of employers who drop coverage in the future ""could be a real issue,"" but for the 2014 statistics, she said, Paul’s calculation seemed ""wildly off base.""Our inquiries to Paul’s office were not returned.Our rulingPaul said that ""for every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."" That’s not mathematically possible. If you take the narrowest definition of ""sign-ups,"" there would have to be 3.3 million cancellations in the state for Paul’s statement to be accurate -- and there aren’t even that many Kentuckians with private insurance plans that could theoretically be canceled. In fact, it’s reasonable to argue that more people in Kentucky have coverage through Obamacare than have been canceled. Paul’s statement is so wildly off that we rate it Pants on Fire.However, in the six months since, the number of private-plan signups has soared by a factor of 10, while the state released a smaller estimate of cancellation notices (168,000). Even in November, Paul’s estimate was cherry-picked; it excluded the 33,561 Kentuckians who enrolled in Medicaid, a program that saw its eligibility expanded under Obamacare.Even though the new numbers were available to Paul’s staff at the time the newsletter was put together, Paul’s office counted only the first two months of signups and ignored the final six months, a period when enrollment rose steadily. Our ruling stands: Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Gina Raimondo says Providence taxes rose nearly 27 percent under Mayor Angel Taveras,"Read our lips: If you want to win an election, accuse your opponent of raising taxes.So it wasn't surprising when Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island's general treasurer and candidate for governor, accused one of her Democratic primary opponents, Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, of overseeing a hefty tax increase.On April 28, 2014, the Raimondo campaign issued a news release headlined, ""Just the Facts: As Providence families pay their property taxes, residential property taxes are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras.""""Under Mayor Taveras,"" it said, ""residential property taxes were raised two separate times: by 5 percent in FY 2012 and by 20.7 percent in FY 2014. In total, residential property taxes, which hit working families hard, are up 26.7 percent since 2011.""The news release even included footnotes that cite the pages in the city's budgets that supported the argument.The Taveras campaign quickly fired back that the allegation was wrong and the average increase for 2014 was about 6 percent, not 20.7 percent.We donned our referee jersey and decided to use the Truth-O-Meter to see who was correct.""We said tax rates are up 26 percent, which is totally, totally accurate,"" said Hyers.But on the same page of the 2014 budget, it notes that the new budget is based on an updated estimate of property values in the city, and residential property values decreased by an average of 13.2 percent.Readers who don't immediately understand why this throws a ridiculously-large monkey wrench into Raimondo's claim need to realize how property tax rates are calculated.The amount you pay depends on how many thousands of dollars your property is worth. If your house and land are worth $100,000 and the tax rate is set at $22 per thousand, your bill will be $2,200, or $100 times $22.Comparing tax rates in isolation before and after a revaluation ignores half the equation.In short: a tax rate -- by itself -- becomes a meaningless number when a municipality has readjusted the value of its tax base.When you take Providence’s revaluation into consideration, a homeowner whose property value went from $150,000 to $130,200 after revaluation saw a tax increase of 10 percent over the three-year period Raimondo is talking about, not 26 or 27 percent, according to our calculation based on city data.We asked Hyers if the Raimondo campaign had realized there had been a revaluation. He said the campaign knew, but it wasn't relevant to the news release.Our rulingIn a news release, State Treasurer Gina Raimondo said, ""Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras.""But the Raimondo ""Just the Facts"" news release misstates the facts, claiming taxes increased by nearly 27 percent.That's a ridiculous assertion, especially coming from the campaign of the current general treasurer, who is also a finance expert and presumably understands municipal finance."
PANTS-FIRE,NEARI Executive Director Robert A. Walsh Jr. says candidate Clay Pell hasn't spent anything on advertising in his run for governor,"During an April 20, 2014, interview on WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers,"" Robert A. Walsh Jr., executive director of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, was asked about the likelihood that Clay Pell would win September's Democratic primary and, ultimately, the November election.Walsh downplayed the importance of the latest polls showing little support among Democrats for Pell, the gubernatorial candidate supported by the union. (Pell was favored by  9.4 percent in an April 11 Brown University poll and 15 percent in a February Providence Journal / WPRI survey.)""Poll numbers in April for a relatively new candidate are meaningless,"" Walsh said. ""What is he? Mid-teens or something right now? But he hasn't spent a dime on advertising or done anything else. He's getting out there meeting people. When he meets people he converts them to his cause and his message.""Hasn't spent a dime on advertising? That didn't make cents to us.Immediately after Pell's announcement on Jan. 28, 2014, it was almost impossible to go online and not see ads for Pell popping up on nearly every website you’d visit -- even those featuring General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, one of Pell’s Democratic opponents.Those ads cost a lot of dimes, so we called Walsh to see if he could justify his claim. He responded by email:""Of course the reference was to the traditional television buys that accompany campaigns (since I was on TV when I mentioned it),"" he wrote.That's not a distinction he made during the program.On April 23 we began an effort to get that information -- even a rough estimate. Pell's campaign promised to get back to us, but despite repeated follow-up calls and emails, we couldn't get our questions answered.A week later, on April 30, the Pell campaign, as required by law, filed its quarterly finance report for the first three months of 2014. It showed that Pell, who began his campaign by loaning himself a million dollars, has now invested another million dollars of his own money in his campaign and spent $311,547 in January, February and March.It also showed that on Jan. 7, Pell spent $36,530 on advertising and media production through a media company in Washington, D.C. The firm got another $7,880 on March 10. (The other two items listed as advertising expenditures were $200 for an ad with the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society and $800 for a full-page ad in the program book of this year's Providence Newspaper Guild Follies, run by unionized workers at The Journal.)Our rulingNEARI executive director Robert Walsh said candidate Clay Pell ""hasn't spent a dime on advertising.""At the time, the Pell campaign had already spent 444,100 dimes, or $44,410, on advertising through a Washington media firm. We know the public has seen at least some of that money because we were inundated with online Pell ads soon after his announcement.To suggest that Pell hasn't spent a dime -- or a quarter, or a dollar -- on advertising is not only short-changing the truth, it's ridiculous."
PANTS-FIRE,Was Jules Bailey instrumental in creating Oregon's Business Energy Tax Credit program?,"One tool government has for steering policy is making tax credits and other incentives available to private companies.You want new development in a tired part of the city? Limit property taxes for qualified investors. Want to cap the burning of fossil fuels? Offer tax credits for new solar and wind projects.Such tax breaks remain politically contentious, however, with critics questioning the use of tax dollars to benefit for-profit corporations.The claim:In Portland, Brian Wilson faces Jules Bailey, currently a legislator, in the May 20 primary election for the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners seat vacated by Deborah Kafoury, who is running for board chair.  Wilson, in an April 28, 2014, email to supporters, dinged Bailey for his involvement with the controversial Business Energy Tax Credit, a program that drew withering criticism in recent years for its ballooning costs.The email describes Bailey’s supporters as including ""corporate lobbyists and out-of-state special interest groups."" It adds, ""He was instrumental in creating the Business Energy Tax Credit that let companies like Wal-Mart profit by $11 million while costing the Oregon general fund $33 million.""Really? We decided to check.First, we checked the numbers. Those are accurate, as reported in a story by Harry Esteve, a politics reporter for The Oregonian, in 2009.On the central issue -- Bailey’s role -- we contacted Bailey, who sent an email saying Wilson is in error.""I think he must have me confused with some other legislator,"" Bailey wrote. ""Since the day I was elected, I have spent every term reining in the abuses of the BETC.""He suggested we call several other sources, including the state Legislature’s Revenue Office, to verify his assertion.Chris Allanach, a senior economist in the Revenue Office, said, yes, the BETC program had been clouded with controversy and that Bailey had played a pivotal role -- not in championing the program, as Wilson claimed, but in reining it in.Bailey sponsored a bill in the 2009 legislative session that affixed sunset dates to all of the program’s tax credits, Allanach said. Bailey also carried the bill, which ultimately passed, on the House floor.Then, during the 2011 session, Bailey co-chaired the Joint Committee on Tax Credits, which carried on the work of the earlier bill, Allanach said. One result of that work means the state now can sell only $3 million in renewable-energy tax credits in any two-year period. Before the new limits, upward of $300 million in credits were being sold per two-year budget cycle.Wanting more information on the history of the program, we called the Oregon Department of Energy. Diana Enright, a department spokeswoman, emailed a chronology showing that the 1979 Legislature created the tax credit incentives that later became the Business Energy Tax Credit program.A sizable expansion of the program occurred in 2007, when the BETC increased from 35 percent to 50 percent for renewable energy projects.From checking Bailey’s legislative website, we know he was first elected in 2008. His first session was 2009. That meant he showed up in Salem 30 years after the program was born and two years after the expansion that triggered most of the controversy.Both of those dates contradict Wilson’s claim that Bailey was ""instrumental in creating"" the program. We called Wilson for his reaction.""Our using the word ‘created’ probably was an inaccurate choice of words,"" he said. ""But he was very much involved with it once he got to the Legislature. He’s been vociferous in his defense of it.""When asked what constituted Bailey’s ""vociferous"" defense of the BETC, Wilson hedged. ""I was really referring to his umbrella statement that he’s spent his time in Salem closing all sorts of corporate loopholes,"" Wilson said. ""It was more about that than the BETC in particular.""In a follow-up call, PolitiFact Oregon told Wilson of Allanach’s view of Bailey’s work.""That’s better information than we had,"" Wilson said. Various sources that have been helping his campaign, he added, told him that Bailey was ""vulnerable"" on the BETC issue.""I never want to put out something that isn’t true,"" he said. ""We will definitely make sure that we correct our information.""The ruling:Brian Wilson, in taking on Jules Bailey in the May 20 Democratic primary, claimed Bailey was ""instrumental"" in creating controversial business tax credits.The program was created long before Bailey was elected, and its expansion to include credits for renewable energy projects occurred two years before Bailey was sworn in.A senior state economist who worked extensively on the program characterized Bailey’s work as ""clamping down"" on the amount of breaks given away. Further, a bill Bailey helped sponsor in his first session, along with a committee he co-chaired in 2011, effectively led to the program’s demise.Wilson, when told that a senior legislative economist backed the notion that Bailey worked to rein in the BETC, said he would amend his claim.

PANTS-FIRE,Napolitano: Washington lacks constitutional right to own land in Western states,"As we heard over and over during the Nevada standoff between federal agents and Cliven Bundy and his gun-bearing supporters, this fight wasn’t about cows or tortoises, it was about land and who controls it. For Bundy, the starting point was clear.""Look at the percentage they own in Nevada, 81 percent. Utah, 66 percent. Idaho, 61 percent,"" Hannity said. ""Why does the government own all of this land anyway?""""Sean, I'm going to make a statement that the government will consider outrageous,"" Napolitano warned. ""The Constitution simply does not authorize the federal government to own any of this land. All of it is being held unconstitutionally and all of it should be returned to the private property owners from which it was taken or to the states in which it exists, period.""We wanted to hear Napolitano’s legal explanation, but he did not get back to us. However, he is not the first to make this claim and we were able to review the legal record to see whether the federal government lacks the constitutional authority as he said.The short answer is that the Constitution, through the Property Clause, specifically gives the government the power to own land. Over time, the Supreme Court has ruled that not only does the government own the land, but it enjoys broad rights in deciding what happens on that land.""The Property Clause gives Congress authority over federal property generally, and the Supreme Court has described Congress’ power to legislate under this Clause as ‘without limitation,’ "" the researcher wrote.""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.""The accompanying essay, by Columbia Law School professor Thomas Merrill, noted that many people have debated the scope of this clause. The most narrow interpretation, Merrill wrote, ""simply allows Congress to act as an ordinary owner of land. It can set policy regarding whether such lands will be sold or retained and, if they are retained, who may enter these lands and for what purposes.""For the purposes of this fact-check, even that limited approach leaves Napolitano high and dry.We asked another legal scholar at Heritage, John Malcolm, if we were misinterpreting anything. Malcolm told us we had it right.""I’m not aware of anything in the Constitution that would preclude the federal government from owning land in these western states,"" Malcolm told PunditFact.This argument has special relevance for states such as Nevada and Utah that were formed from large swaths of land owned by Washington. By this legal logic, when those states entered the Union, the federal government lost the ability to own land there.That Congressional Research Service report along with Heritage Foundation’s guide note that since 1845, the Supreme Court has issued many decisions that strengthen the government’s hand. An 1897 case said Congress could block someone from putting up fences on private land if it blocked access to public land. In 1911, the court affirmed the use of large tracts of land as national forests, held in the public interest.John Leshy is a professor of real property law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. Leshy served in the Interior Department in the Carter and Clinton administrations and was part of the transition team when President Barack Obama first took office.""Napolitano’s statement is absurd,"" Leshy said. ""The constitutional basis of federal land ownership is not subject to any serious debate among scholars, and hasn’t been for a very long time.""Our rulingNapolitano said the federal government has no constitutional authority to own land in many Western states. The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Social media meme says 300,000 suicides are attributable to foreclosures","A reader recently asked us to check a social media meme with a striking statistic about foreclosures and suicides.It said, ""1.4 million homes stolen by banks since 2008. Over 300K home owner suicides attributed to foreclosures. Why won't anyone defend these American property owners' rights?""Have there really been 300,000 suicides linked to foreclosures? We decided to take a look.So we next checked annual death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent report came out in December 2013, covering statistics for 2010.For 2010, CDC found that suicide was the 10th most common cause of death, with 38,364 cases. Here’s the number for the past nine years: YearSuicides201038,364200936,909200836,035200734,598200633,300200532,637200432,439200331,484200231,655Total, 2002-10307,151 So the total number of suicides from 2002-10 is around 300,000. But for the meme to be correct, you’d have to believe that every single American suicide between 2002 and 2010 was caused by a foreclosure. Of course, that assumes there was a reliable way to measure this kind of causal effect. (The CDC reports don't address what caused a person to commit suicide.) And the meme is even further off-base it it intends to be referring only to suicides since 2008.We asked several experts whether the meme's claim was even remotely possible.""There is no basis for this claim,"" said Douglas Massey, a population-research professor at Princeton University.In their own research, Currie and Tekin found that a location with about 400 foreclosures in a year might see 24 more medical visits for mental health conditions, including suicide attempts. But that wouldn’t be enough to support the meme’s claim, Currie said.Our rulingThe meme said that over 300,000 homeowner suicides are attributable to foreclosures. But that would mean every suicide over a nine-year period would have been caused by a foreclosure, and experts say that’s not credible. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Lead bullets will have to come from overseas after EPA closed smelter, chain email says","The email goes on to blame the ""Evil Protection Agency"" for shutting down a lead smelting plant, calling it ""backdoor gun control"" and saying it will result in the cost of bullets soaring.""All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" the email says, adding, ""Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment.

Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development.""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant.""Doe Run’s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets.A company spokeswoman told us in December that more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications.""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company said in a statement. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri.""In our previous fact check, Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey told us that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead.""We contacted Stankey again for this fact-check.""The primary smelter did close, (but) we are still supplying ammo customers through our only secondary smelter,"" she told us. ""We do know that primary lead is being imported to the U.S., but we don’t know if it is specific to ammunition suppliers. ...

Spokesman Mike Bazinet told us for this fact-check that ""almost all the lead used in ammunition in the U.S. comes from secondary sources, recycled car batteries and other sources of lead. The closing of the lead smelter has not had any effect on ammunition prices or availability. ... Lead for bullets comes from secondary sources, and that was not completely understood by people out there. We certainly tried explain that it's had virtually no effect on ammunition prices.""While some ammunition is imported to the U.S. from overseas, ""it would be pretty heavy stuff to send (lead) across the ocean and put into a bullet. There are secondary sources of lead in sufficient quantity in the United States.""Tom Falone -- president of Clearwater-based Florida Bullet, which supplies ammunition to law-enforcement agencies in Florida -- said its manufacturer has been using reclaimed lead for years.""I think that by the time we see a shortage, the industry will have found another material to replace the lead with,"" Falone said.Our rulingA chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in Missouri, ""all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!""While the closure of a Doe Run primary lead smelter in December 2013 means there are no smelters to make lead from ore anywhere in the United States, smelters to recycle lead remain in operation, and their output is substantial enough to satisfy the needs of ammunition manufacturers.

PANTS-FIRE,Did Sen. Harry Reid drive the standoff at the Bundy ranch for personal gain?,"The furor over Cliven Bundy’s cows in Nevada has churned up some powerful speculation about the murky forces at play. A long-running effort by the federal Bureau of Land Management to stop Bundy from letting his cattle forage without paying any grazing fees (on land that was off-limits to grazing in any event) turned into a standoff between federal agents and Bundy’s supporters, both well armed.Out of that drama came the assertion that Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid was behind it all and the goal was personal gain. Reid publicly endorsed federal action against Bundy.""It’s very simple. Harry Reid, senator from Nevada, is using federal violence to take people’s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese. That’s what the Bundy Ranch deal is all about.""The government had no interest in Bundy’s property. It wanted his cattle off government land.Reid’s son had represented a Chinese firm that had been interested in developing a solar energy array, but the deal involved land far from the Bundy property and collapsed a year ago.The Bureau of Land Management has identified a desert area for solar power development, but it is about 50 miles away from both the Bundy ranch and the federal land where he likes to graze his cattle.The habitat protections on the land Bundy wants to use were put in place in 1994, long before there was any hint of Chinese interest.""Reid’s son is involved with BLM customers, putting together deals right where Clive Bundy’s ranch is,"" Calvo said. ""The federal government is ready to send armed guards in to take peoples land, unconstitutionally, illegally, over what I believe is making sweetheart deals to the Chinese.""""Coincidentally, part of that solar energy expansion includes a plan by China's ENN Energy Group to build what would be America's largest solar energy complex,"" the editorial said. ""The site chosen with the guidance of Reid's son, Rory, is in Laughlin, Nev. Laughlin is in Clark County, where Bundy's ranch is.""Clark County covers more than 8,000 square miles. Laughlin is about 100 miles as the crow flies from Bundy’s ranch.The BLM did invite energy companies to submit proposals in mid March. This was the final step in a two-year process aimed at managing the environmental impacts of any development that might take place in these zones.Some of Bundy’s defenders have said that blocking him from Gold Butte would make it easier to build at Dry Lake.""That really wouldn’t make any sense,"" Connor said. ""Gold Butte was set aside as an ACEC in 1994. You can’t use the same land twice to protect the same habitat. There really is no connection between what’s going on at Dry Lake and what’s going on at Gold Butte.""Our rulingThe Republic Broadcasting Network said Sen. Reid was behind the use of force to take away Bundy’s land and sell it to the Chinese. There is nothing accurate about this claim. The dispute involved Bundy’s long use of federal land without a permit. The land gained protected status long before solar energy projects were on the table. The Chinese solar energy proposal no longer exists. The land where such projects might be developed are far from Bundy’s property.We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,David Dewhurst lofts ridiculous unsupported claim about Dan Patrick legally changing his name to hide debts,"Dan Patrick of Houston walked away from hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and, according to his opponent in a May 27, 2014, Republican lieutenant governor primary runoff, ""changed his name from Danny Goeb to hide from the debts.""""If he can’t run his own business honestly,"" a woman says in the ad launched Aprl 16, 2014, by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, ""how can we ever trust him to run the state honestly?""Patrick’s past bankruptcy and name change have drawn news coverage before. We wanted to look into the charge that Patrick, a state senator since 2007, changed his name in connection with his financial difficulties, something we hadn't heard before.That may be because it's not factually supported.We asked for evidence to support the claim from the Dewhurst campaign and received none.News stories dating to Patrick’s first Senate campaign, in 2006, indicate he legally changed his name years after his bankruptcy filing and after he’d presented himself as Dan Patrick for decades in his careers as a TV broadcaster, businessman and conservative talk-radio host.So, Patrick used his professional name long before the bankruptcy. He legally changed his name more than 15 years after filing for personal bankruptcy.Patrick describes his name change on a campaign web page, saying his birth name, with Goeb pronounced like globe, ""was not a pleasant sounding name or easy to spell if you didn’t see it. I have never used it on air. Beginning with my first radio job at age 18 back in 1968 I used my first and middle name only. I was Dan Scott on the radio and planned on keeping that as my on air name always.""However, Elden Hale, the man who hired me for my first TV anchor job in 1977 told me I needed to change my air name before joining his station in Scranton, Pa. He asked me to pick a new name because there was an anchor with the last name of Scott on a competing station. He didn’t want any confusion. I was so excited to finally get my first anchor job in television whatever he wanted me to do in that regard was fine with me.""My wife and I picked Dan Patrick. Her brother’s middle name was Patrick. I have been known as Dan Patrick for 36 years. My parents even became known as the Patricks. Even though our legal name was Goeb all those years my wife and children were known as the Patricks by most folks."" In the post, Patrick went on to say he legally changed his name to Dan Goeb Patrick so he could present himself as Dan Patrick in any possible bid for elected office.Our rulingDewhurst said Patrick changed his name to hide from his debts.The lieutenant governor offered no backup for this claim, which shakes out as factually illogical. Patrick’s bankruptcy case ended in 1992; he has said he legally changed his name 11 years later.That gap in time alone leads us to see this claim as both incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! "
PANTS-FIRE,Freedom Partners ad accuses Rep. Bruce Braley of giving 'special favors' to insurers by voting for Obamacare,"Here’s the full narration of the ad:""No one likes it when politicians give special favors. Congressman Bruce Braley voted for Obamacare. The government spent millions of taxpayer dollars to promote it. Now, health insurance companies stand to make billions. And Bruce Braley? He takes tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry. For Iowans, it's canceled policies and higher costs. That's not right. Call Bruce Braley. Tell him: Stand with Iowa. Stop supporting Obamacare.""There’s a lot to chew on here, but we decided to narrow our focus to the claim that Braley took ""tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry"" and gave them ""special favors"" by voting for Obamacare.Did Braley take ""tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry""?In Braley’s case, yes -- he took ""tens of thousands"" from the insurance industry. But saying that misses a whole bunch of important context.In isolation, this may sound like a lot. But here’s the context.Over the last decade, Braley has received a total of $16,000 from health insurance political action committees: $8,500 from Humana, $3,000 from Delta Dental, $2,500 from VSP Holdings and $2,000 from AFLAC. He received an additional $4,500 from eight individual donors employed by a health insurance company, all but one donation smaller than $750.Altogether, this is $20,500 from health insurance sources -- less than a quarter of his take from insurers more generally, and about $2,000 for every year he’s served in Congress. ""This is not a lot of money to influence a huge vote like that,"" said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.If we are going to compare Braley to other Senate candidates on an apples-to-apples basis, it’s only feasible to use the the Center for Responsive Politics’ standard data for ""insurance"" companies.So how does Braley’s insurance haul compare to that other lawmakers? Not very impressively. Among all Senate candidates running in 2014, Braley ranks 55th. Since there are just 36 Senate races this year, some of which feature minimal opposition to incumbents, that’s pretty low indeed for a sitting House member in a competitive seat to rank 55th.And how big a share of Braley’s warchest comes from this broader swath of the insurance industry? Not very big.The insurance industry ranks 19th on the list of biggest sector donors to Braley’s campaigns over his entire career. For the 2014 cycle, insurance ranks 16th among all sectors donating to Braley. In all, insurance donations account for less than 1 percent of all the cash Braley has raised during his political career.Was it a special favor to the health insurance industry to vote for Obamacare?For one thing, it’s not as simple as the ad says -- the insurance industry hardly loves every aspect of the law, so it’s not clear that voting for it was an undiluted gift for the industry. ""In particular, the medical loss ratio that limits their profits and requires 80 cents on each dollar be spent on insurance recipients keeps their profits from soaring,"" Ornstein said.In addition, it strains logic to think that Braley would have turned from an opponent of the law, or even agnostic about it, to a supporter of it simply because of the desires of donors who collectively gave him a fraction of one percent of his total campaign warchest.""You've been out there talking about your values for health care reform and, for some of us, it's made us more dedicated than ever to doing something meaningful about health care reform,"" Braley said, according to the newspaper.Combined, Braley’s past promises and pressure from his party are likely to have outweighed any campaign donations from the industry, Ornstein said. The partisan pressure to toe the line on the health care bill was especially strong because it was the No. 1 legislative priority of a president from his own party, and the vote would be decided essentially along party lines.""Political science scholars have spilled much ink and used countless hours of computer time linking these kinds of ordinary contributions to voting outcomes, and have come up with very little,"" said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist.A final point: If the ad considers donations from the insurance industry to be the linchpin of a politician’s support for Obamacare, how can this explain the overall pattern of donations by the insurance industry?As it turns out, nine of the 13 Senate candidates who received the most money from the insurance industry in 2014 are Republicans, a list headed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who received $231,800. Yet despite the backing of the industry, none of these Republicans voted for Obamacare.And what about Braley’s fellow Iowan, Grassley? Grassley -- who did not vote for Obamacare -- has received $318,202 from the insurance industry in the 2014 cycle, or about 13 times as much as Braley did over the same period. And the insurance industry’s ranking among the industries donating to Grassley? It ranks first.Freedom Partners’ argumentA spokesman for Freedom Partners, James Davis, said just looking at the size of the donations misses the point.""The point we're making is: How can Rep. Braley claim he's standing up to health insurance companies, while at the same time taking their campaign donations and supporting Obamacare – a huge boon to the health insurance industry?"" Davis said. ""It's not about where he falls in the line of donations – it's about saying one thing and doing another.""However, we don’t think the use of the phrase ""special favors"" and ""friends in the health insurance industry"" suggests hypocrisy. Rather, it all but suggests that Braley is corrupt, pursuing damaging policies because he gains personally from interested parties. And on that score, the evidence is thin indeed. We asked Freedom Partners if they had any evidence of favors Braley had done for specific companies, but the group did not reply.Our rulingFreedom Partners’ ad claims that Braley took ""tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry"" and gave them ""special favors"" by voting for Obamacare.Braley did take tens of thousands of dollars from the insurance industry, though from all types of insurers, not just health insurers. However, Braley, like most Democrats, had campaigned on expanding health coverage to the uninsured, and then, faced with a landmark and highly partisan vote, carried through on his stated intentions. It’s ridiculous to suggest that donors who contributed less than 1 percent of his warchest weighed more heavily on his vote than his ideology, his past campaign promises and his partisan affiliation.

PANTS-FIRE,Mary Burke says wages are declining in Wisconsin at double the rate of other states,"At the center of Mary Burke’s economic critique of the Gov. Scott Walker era is the charge that Wisconsin’s recovery from the Great Recession has lagged behind other states.Are we really losing ground on wages that quickly?We started with the source cited in Burke’s plan: ""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector wages in Wisconsin fell 2.2% in the 12 months ending September 2012, double the 1.1% decline experienced by the nation overall.""Those numbers were familiar to us.That story ran May 26, 2013, citing the most-recent wage data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.It showed Wisconsin wages were declining at double the rate of other states.But that was then, and this is now.Newer numbersWage data for both the state and nation is volatile and fluctuates strongly when measured in increments of 12 months or one quarter.Since those September 2012 figures were released, the BLS has published four quarterly updates. Each update looks at one quarter and compares it with the same quarter a year earlier.(Data notes: There’s a reporting lag of about six months due to the time spent collecting and analyzing the data; the most recent available runs through September 2013. These are averages, so they point to a general trend.)It turns out Burke’s campaign plan selected the worst quarterly wages report during the Walker era and the end of the final term of Gov. Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010.The report she cited ranked Wisconsin at 47th among the states for percent change in average weekly wage (including bonuses) for the one-year period ending in September 2012 quarter. The average wage fell -- losing 2.2 percent in preliminary calculations and 2.3 percent in the final analysis. That was a reduction for workers of $18 a week.But that trend did not hold either in Wisconsin or nationally.Wisconsin’s private-sector wage growth has made a big move in the opposite direction, topping the national average starting with the March 2013 quarterly report.We found:-- For the quarter ending December 2012, the average weekly wage went up (4.9 percent), not down, compared with the same period a year earlier. That was tied for 18th best among the states, and only slightly trailed the national average wage increase.-- By March 2013, the average increase was 1.2 percent, three times better than the national average.-- By June 2013, the increase was 2.2 percent, slightly above the national average and tied for 19th.-- For the one-year period ending in the September 2013 quarter, the state’s wage growth was fifth best in the country, beating the national average (3.4 percent gain vs. 1.9 percent gain).The picture changesIt shows Wisconsin’s wage growth in that period ahead of all adjoining Midwest states and behind only North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana and Nebraska nationally. Drilling down, average Wisconsin wages grew 2.8 percent in goods-producing jobs and 3.7 percent in service jobs.In sum, the 2013 picture on wage growth so far is much different than the one for 2012, but is omitted by Burke.Her jobs plan pointedly blames ""misguided"" Walker actions over three years for helping make Wisconsin’s recovery an outlier -- while examining only one quarterly report of wage data from 2012.We filled in that gap some more by looking at other quarterly wage reports that reflect wage trends in Walker’s first year, 2011. In those,  Wisconsin’s wage increase topped the national mark twice. In a third, average wages dropped both nationally and in Wisconsin (-1.6 percent and -2.2 percent, respectively).Burke’s campaign told us she meant to spotlight a long-term gap between Wisconsin and U.S. earnings growth trends.Burke’s jobs plan does, we note, discuss job and wage trends in the context both of Walker and the years preceding his election.But her campaign pointed us to nothing that shows Wisconsin’s average wages have dropped over an extended period, much less at twice the rate of the mark in other states.Our ratingBurke’s economic plan said that ""Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states.""That was the situation in one quarter ending in September 2012, but Wisconsin wages are not declining at all based on much more current data.Burke’s plan cherry-picked an outdated report that turned out to be an anomaly. More recent data that shows Wisconsin’s average wages not only growing but topping the national mark three quarters in a row.All this is easily accessed on federal websites and publicized in news releases issued by federal officials.

I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians, and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States.""He later called the planet’s age ""one of the great mysteries.""The comment drew criticism around the Internet, sparking a string of opinion pieces from blogs and mainstream news organizations alike. Commentators specifically wondered about Rubio’s answer because of his position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.""First of all, let me tell you about the answer I gave. The answer I gave was actually trying to make the same point the president made a few years ago, and that is there is no scientific debate on the age of the Earth. I mean, it’s established, pretty definitively. It’s 4 and a half… at least four and half billion years old. I was referring to a theological debate, which is a pretty healthy debate,"" Rubio said.PaulIn June 2010, Paul gave a speech at a Christian Homeschool Educators of Kentucky meeting, after which he took questions from the audience.One audience member asked the then-candidate for Senate, ""Was there a point in life that you became Christian that you recognized? And also, how old is the world?""Other than that, Paul hasn’t made public comments on his opinions about when the Earth came to be.Our ruling Being Liberal’s Facebook post claimed Rubio and Paul believe the Earth is 9,000 and 10,000 years old, respectively. While both men have made vague statements concerning their beliefs about the age of the Earth, neither has publicly cited the figures claimed in the post, and Rubio has even given the widely held scientific answer to the question.As for the senators’ views on the fate of the dinosaurs, we’ll take a page from Rubio’s playbook and call it one of the world’s great mysteries, because it doesn’t appear either has said anything in public regarding the issue."
PANTS-FIRE,Drudge links to report claiming White House press briefings are 'show',"In Halper’s article, the headline said it all: ""Reporter: WH press secretary gets questions from reporters before press briefing: It’s just a show.""Halper didn’t write too much more. Mainly, he inserted a video of a reporter from an Arizona CBS affiliate talking about what she learned on her visit to the White House.The reporter, Catherine Anaya, said Carney told her that the questions correspondents ask ""are provided to him in advance. So then he knows what he's going to be answering and sometimes those correspondents and reporters also have those answers printed in front of them.""Drudge’s headline -- at the top of its page -- meant the news quickly spread through other websites and Twitter (likely making for a good traffic day at weeklystandard.com).We got in touch with Anaya, and she let us know in an email that she had confused the matter. Basically, she had a question for President Barack Obama that was of more local than national interest. She had the option to submit it in advance, and she got that muddied with how the usual press briefings take place.""I was attempting to not waste national time on a local question but in my attempt at explaining that I unintentionally made it sound like that experience applied to everyone,"" Anaya said. ""That is my mistake and I own up to it.""Update: Here is the CBS 5 statement, issued by Anaya.""Last night during my live reports from the White House I attempted to describe the highlights of the day. I was speaking off the cuff and unscripted and in the process I made two major mistakes: I reported an off the record conversation and what I reported was not accurate. I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting. But it was not intentional and I would never purposely report inaccurate information. The White House never asked for my questions in advance and never instructed me what to ask. I chose to provide one of my questions in advance of the press briefing because I wanted to make sure it would have broad appeal. I did not attribute or report factually last night and for that I deeply apologize. I pride myself on truth and objectivity. I sincerely regret any harm I've caused and I hope that you willWe asked White House reporters if they are ever asked to send in their questions, and get replies, before the actual briefings. In one form or another, they all said, no way. (We also created a video attached to this fact-check that shows some of the interactions between Carney and the press corps.)Steve Thomma, senior White House correspondent for McClatchy and president of the White House Correspondents Association said, ""I've never heard of a scripted set up before a briefing.""NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley was also bemused. ""This story has generated some pained smiles today in the White House press room,"" Horsley said.Horsley explained that reporters ask plenty of questions outside of the briefings and so the press office staff will know what’s on their minds. If a longer term reporting story is in play, Horsley will tell the White House staff what he needs to know.""But as a general rule, the briefings are not scripted that way. If they were, they could be a lot shorter,"" Horsley said.Our rulingThe Drudge Report gave top billing to the claim that the daily White House press briefings are ""just a show,"" with questions submitted and answered in advance.That claim relied on the report of a television anchor in Arizona. But the Drudge Report did all it could to make the statement go viral. Accountability applies as much to spreading information, especially for a website as popular as the Drudge Report, as it does to the journalist who wrote the article.The reporter behind Halper’s article now says she made a mistake and really doesn’t know what happens in the briefings. She was considering asking a question about a local issue and wanted to know if it would be appropriate to ask at the regular press briefing. She opted to save the question for her interview with Obama.According to Carney and the reporters whom he faces daily, this scenario in no way matches up with their experiences.Halper took a shaky report and drew a strong conclusion without proof. Drudge put that claim on steroids. We rate this statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,The United States spent $5 billion on Ukraine anti-government riots,"It’s a conspiracy with mainstream crossover: The United States bankrolled the bloody political uprising in Ukraine.Obama ""spends $5 billion paying Ukrainians to riot and dismantle their democratically elected government.""So is there any truth to this claim? PunditFact dove in.The rootsThe claim is rooted in a December 2013 speech by Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, a non-governmental agency that promotes democracy in the former Soviet republic.Nuland had returned days earlier from her third trip to Ukraine in five weeks to assess the protests over President Viktor Yanukovych’s policies to move away from the European Union, she said.She made clear the United States supported the protesters’ fight and spoke of how she met with Yanukovych, pressing him to end the pushback from Ukrainian security forces because it is ""absolutely impermissible in a European state, in a democratic state.""She described how American taxpayer money has supported Ukraine’s democratic development despite the country’s challenges.""Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build democratic skills and institutions, as they promote civic participation and good governance, all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its European aspirations,"" she said. ""We have invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.""The truthWe had a feeling that folks repeating the claim missed important context from Nuland’s speech. Wasn’t Nuland talking about money given since Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union?The State Department said yes.""The insinuation that the United States incited the people of Ukraine to riot or rebel is patently false,"" said Nicole Thompson, a State Department spokeswoman.Since 1992, the government has spent about $5.1 billion to support democracy-building programs in Ukraine, Thompson said, with money flowing mostly from the Department of State via U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as the departments of Defense, Energy, Agriculture and others. The United States does this with hundreds of other countries.The descriptions are a bit vague, which could lead people to think the money was used for some clandestine purpose.But even if it that were so, the money in question was spent over more than 20 years. Yanukovych was elected in 2010. So any connection between the protests and the $5 billion is inaccurate.And Obama was elected in 2008, so any connection between $5 billion and Obama also is inaccurate.The challengeWe attempted to drill down and verify the expenditures independently but found that a difficult task.""The Foreign Assistance dashboard is not capturing this information in an up-to-date, current way,"" Valentinuzzi said, ""so responding to a humanitarian crisis is a bit untraceable while it happens, which we argue makes it less effective, basically.""From that website, we calculated the United States spent $456.4 million in Ukraine since 2009. Again, that’s an incomplete picture based on incomplete data reporting.Our rulingContrary to claims, the United States did not spend $5 billion to incite the rebellion in Ukraine.That’s a distorted understanding of remarks given by a State Department official. She was referring to money spent on democracy-building programs in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Napolitano: Lincoln tried to arm the slaves,"We tried to find out what lies behind Napolitano’s claim that Lincoln tried to arm the slaves, but we never heard from the judge or his staff.We turned to Bruce Levine, a Civil War historian at the University of Illinois.""I know of no evidence -- have never even heard it said -- that Lincoln himself tried to arm those who were still slaves to enable a slave insurrection -- and I very strongly doubt that any such evidence exists,"" Levine said.Levine said an early draft of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation included the idea that if the slaves rose up, Union troops would do nothing to stop them. But that disappeared from the final version.""Because even that was considered too politically incendiary,"" Levine said.There is one way that the statement might be said to have some truth, though it's a stretch. As the war got underway, some people in slavery were able to get away and seek refuge with Union troops. This created a legal quandary for some commanders because under federal law, these people were still the property of their owners.The act went further and authorized Lincoln to ""employ as many persons of African descent as he may deem necessary and proper for the suppression of this rebellion, and for this purpose he may organize and use them in such manner as he may judge best for the public welfare.""""Congress authorized Lincoln to use blacks in any capacity he chose -- laborers, soldiers, etc.,"" Foner said. ""In the fall, the War Department authorized raising black troops on the Sea Islands of South Carolina, under the command of the white abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson.""Because this preceded the Emancipation Proclamation by several months, it could be argued that these newly liberated people were slaves armed by the Union, but that seems like a legal stretch and hardly what people hearing Napolitano’s comments would conclude.Our rulingNapolitano said that Lincoln tried to arm the slaves. Napolitano provided no supporting proof and no historian we contacted knew of any such effort by the president. The Union efforts to strip Confederate slave owners of their legal claims to enslaved people ultimately led to the formation of units of black soldiers. While these men might not have enjoyed clear legal status as free men, they could not be called slaves.We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chain email says child upbraided Barack Obama in 'clapping' demonstration about gun violence,"A reader recently sent us a chain email that seemed hard to believe.Accompanied by a photograph of President Barack Obama conversing with a classroom of students, the chain email included the following text:""Barack Obama, at a recent rural elementary school assembly in South Carolina, asked the audience for total quiet. Then, in the silence, he started to slowly clap his hands once every few seconds, holding the audience in total silence. Then he said into the microphone, 'Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence.' Then, little Darrell, with a proud South Carolina drawl, pierced the quiet and said, ‘Well, dumb a--, stop clappin’!’""The reader wanted to know: Did this really happen?We didn’t hear back from the White House, but we couldn’t find any instance of such an exchange in transcripts listed on the White House website or in the Nexis news database. A Google search turned up many variations of this claim repeated in the conservative blogosphere, but none from an independent news source.Even earlier, in September 2007, Snopes found one aimed at Hillary Clinton, who was then running against Obama in the Democratic presidential primary. This time, the episode supposedly took place in North Florida, with an unnamed ""young voice with a proud southern accent"" saying, ""Well, just stop clappin’, ya evil b----!""By the next year, 2006, Snopes documented an email similar to the Obama email, this one with Bono the target. In this version, it’s a voice with a ""thick Scottish brogue"" that tells Bono, ""Well stop ----ing doing it then!!""This makes it clear that the episode is a joke rather than an actual event involving Obama.Our rulingA chain email said President Obama told a room of students, ""Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence."" A child then purportedly told Obama he could solve the problem by not clapping anymore.We failed to find any evidence that this happened to Obama, and the existence of earlier emails making fun of Hillary Clinton and Bono make clear that this is a joke being passed off falsely as a real anecdote. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Democratic challenger Mary Burke says Wisconsin unemployment has increased under Gov. Scott Walker,"Midway through the ad, unveiled March 5, 2014, the narrator says that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up.""Simultaneously, a figure on the screen changes from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent.So, under Walker, has unemployment really gone up? And what are the numbers?What Burke saysThe ad starts by touting Burke. It cites Wisconsin jobs at Trek Bicycle Corp., the Burke family business, where Mary Burke worked as an executive years ago. And it states that Wisconsin had 72,000 more jobs when Burke served as state commerce secretary than it does today.Then the ad stops talking about Burke and transitions to Walker, citing anti-Burke ads from what it calls ""Walker's"" Republican Governors Association. Walker is a member of the national association's executive committee and was vice chairman in 2013.The narrator then says that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up."" That’s when the figure on the screen spins from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official jobs counter, is footnoted as the source.The narrator continues the attack on Walker by saying job prospects are down and layoffs continue.Regarding the unemployment rate claim specifically, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki told us: ""We're not examining it in terms of (Walker’s) time in office overall -- we're comparing it what it was when Burke was commerce secretary.""But that's not what the viewer sees and hears when the ad pivots from praising Burke to attacking Walker. It talks only about Walker; it doesn’t compare him to Burke.Moreover, with the narrator’s words presented along with the two percentages on the screen, Burke’s message is that unemployment during Walker’s time as governor has risen from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent.But unemployment was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office. And the trend since then has been down, not up.Rates are downAsked for evidence to back the claim, Zepecki did not cite numbers from the start of Walker’s tenure. He told us that on an annual average, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was never higher than 4.8 percent during the more 2 1/2 years that Burke was commerce secretary. In contrast, Zepecki said, the monthly rate under Walker has never been below 6.2 percent.-- When Burke served as state commerce secretary -- February 2005 to November 2007 -- Wisconsin's unemployment rate was steady. It started at 4.8 percent, hit a high of 4.9 percent in June 2007 and went as low as 4.6 percent, which was the rate when she left.-- After Burke left the commerce post, unemployment rose, and later dropped, during the rest of Doyle’s second term as governor. The rate peaked three times at 9.2 percent, including as late as January 2010, then eventually fell to 7.8 percent in December 2010, Doyle’s final full month in office.-- Under Walker, the highest unemployment rate has been 7.7 percent -- including in January 2011, the month he took office. Since then, the rate has gradually trended downward, with a bump up here and there, to a low of 6.3 percent in December 2013, the latest month available.So, without stating any comparison between Burke and Walker, the ad claims unemployment is higher under Walker and provides figures indicating an increase from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But the rate was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office and it has gone down, not up, during his tenure.Our ratingBurke's said that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up,"" from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent.Burke defends the claim by saying 4.8 percent is a reference to when she served as state commerce secretary, which was several years before Walker became governor. But the ad gives no indication that that is the comparison she is making.Moreover, during Walker’s time as governor, unemployment started at 7.7 percent, not 4.8 percent. And rather than trending upward, the rate has steadily dropped to 6.3 percent.For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire."

And we keep going after these guys.""The adrenaline is something like you will never experience, I hope you never have to experience it, but when we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters. We call them mongrels. We call bad people who are destroying our neighborhoods mongrels.""Is Nugent a cop? Does he ""conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers?""We wanted to know.'I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout'Lake County, Mich., is located about 90 miles north of Grand Rapids. It has about 11,500 residents and describes itself as ""an outdoor recreation paradise.""Nugent is a reservist for the county sheriff's office, Sheriff Robert Hilts told us. But, ""He’s never joined us for any raids. Fortunately, we don’t have those sorts of problems up here.""Hilts said Nugent has no authority or official responsibilities. The only activity involving Nugent that Hilts could recall was raising money on behalf of the department and for a local boy who has cystic fibrosis.""We’re always searching the woods for a hunter that’s lost or hurt,"" Hilts said. ""He helped us buy a four-wheel drive offroad vehicle so we could reach people faster.""'I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers'Nugent does not seem to be a cop in the way most people would understand that word. The picture was about the same for the federal agencies Nugent named.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) told us, ""We are not aware of him conducting any raids with us.""We asked the Texas Department of Public Safety on what occasions Nugent had joined Texas Rangers on raids. Press secretary Tom Vinger said, ""In regards to your question about the Texas Rangers, that did not occur.""Joe Moses, a 22-year veteran special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told us they have no record or recollection of Nugent participating in any of their operations. However, when there are special projects that involve many federal, state and local agencies, they wouldn’t necessarily know the name of everyone who showed up.At the same time, Moses said there are strict standards for who is involved in an actual raid.""You would not have someone who didn’t hold the status of a police officer or federal agent participate in such an operation,"" Moses said. The process of arresting a person or collecting evidence must withstand challenge in a courtroom. It is not a place for the inexperienced, Moses told us.The FBI said it could neither confirm nor deny Nugent’s participation in a raid.When we reached out to Nugent, an assistant did not provide evidence that Nugent participated in raids with the FBI, the DEA or the ATF.Instead, Nugent’s assistant Linda Peterson wrote, ""Ted has been active in the following: U.S. Marshal Service FALCON fugitive task force arrest raids in Texas …""With the U.S. Marshals, observers work under clear limits.""They cannot go with us into private residences,"" Oney said. ""So, he would have had to remain in the vehicle or on the sidewalk or some other public area.""That ride-along took place about nine years ago. No law enforcement agency told us that Nugent has any current role in their efforts to apprehend felons.Other evidenceNugent found the training experience very realistic.""Let me tell you, when the room goes dark and the video begins to roll, you become so totally engulfed in the scenario that you are 100 percent psychologically living the event as if it is real life,"" he wrote. ""It is no longer a video as far as your mind tells you.""It is possible this may have shaped his recollections.Our rulingNugent said he is and has been a cop in Michigan and that he conducts raids with several federal and state law enforcement agencies. He said ""we are re-arresting fugitive felons"" and painted a vivid picture of being with agents immediately afterward.""When we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters,"" Nugent said.The single piece of this narrative that Nugent confirmed is one ride-along with U.S. Marshals in 2005. He is not a cop in Michigan by any conventional meaning of the word. No agency said that he presently plays any role in any of their raids.Nugent may have been passionate but his words take him far beyond the facts. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Facebook posts say Pelosi supports longer ER wait times,"It’d probably be big news if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly stated that she favors extending emergency room wait times.PolitiFact wanted to put this claim to rest after a skeptical reader wrote in asking us whether Pelosi actually said this.Our own searches for news clips came up empty. A spokesman from Pelosi’s office told us she didn’t say it.""Naysayers claim the ACA will turn our nation’s emergency rooms into those similar to Europe’s, where people can sit all day in understaffed hospitals as they wait to get their feverish illnesses addressed, or their broken limbs fixed, their convulsions stopped, that knife removed from their skulls, or their fingers reattached.I doubt such dire fears will ever come true here.   But for argument’s sake let us presume I am wrong (which I never am) and that '’Obamacare'’ will force Americans to wait in emergency rooms longer than they already do.  In that case, has it ever occurred to people the great new friends that can be made while waiting for hours in abject misery alongside others also in abject pain and misery?""Pelosi, like most of her party, consistently supports Obamacare. And hey, she may also support making new friends. But there’s no evidence to suggest that she twisted potentially longer emergency room wait times into a good thing.Our rulingFacebook posts quoted Pelosi as saying, ""Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!""

PANTS-FIRE,Do 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for him in 2012? Nope,"For President Barack Obama’s opponents, word of his latest downfall was stunning and welcome.But the news is wrong. PunditFact will explain why.The origins of the claimThe story that accompanied the poll, headlined ""Mitt Romney’s phantom campaign,"" explored whether Romney is viewed more favorably ahead of the 2016 presidential election given more positive media buzz about a Netflix documentary about him. (The answer, based on their polling data, is not really.)YouGov polled about 1,000 voters over two days in early February, asking voters of Romney and Obama if they would make the same decision today that they did in November 2012. YouGov found 90 percent of Romney voters would vote for Romney again, while 79 percent of Obama voters said they would stick with Obama.Of the remaining 2012 Obama voters, 10 percent said they would not vote for him again, and 11 percent said they were unsure.Of 35 people in that group, 25 said yes. That's 71 percent.So of the people who voted for Obama, 396, 6 percent said they had regrets.In the eyes of YouGov assistant editor William Jordan, this was not worth mentioning in the original write-up.""We did not think it surprising that the small number of voters who said they would no longer voted for Obama now regretted voting for him,"" he said.Breaking free from the factsThis is where things get messy.Bedard wrote that 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for his re-election.Why? YouGov, while correctly reporting its sample sizes and percentages in its tables, left off an important disclaimer in describing who got question. No one realized it until someone asked about it the day after posting the results.Instead it said, ""Asked of those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012."" That language suggests a sample size of 396 voters, not 35.""The 71 percent who regretted voting for Obama, which was picked up by various media outlets, is of the 3.5 percent (35 of 999 respondents) of the sample who said they voted for Obama in 2012 and would not vote for him today,"" Jordan said.But there’s no recall button for bad information on the Web. This one spread like a bad chain email.Our rulingReports on blogs, television, radio and Twitter said a YouGov.com poll showed 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for him.The number is wildly high, based on incomplete wording in a poll report and a less-than-perfect reading of that report by news organizations.Surveys require a great deal of attention from pollsters and reporters alike, especially ones with political overtones, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. As the sample size shrinks, the margin of error rate expands.Point being, while the overall YouGov poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, the question about regret would have a much higher margin of error.  ""You’ve got to be really careful when you’re looking at subsamples of subsamples of subsamples,"" Bowman said.In this case, that didn’t happen. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Dick Durbin says U.S. debt is on track to fall by $3 trillion in next 10 years,"When you hear discussion of the federal debt, the trendlines usually go only one way: up.Durbin told host Chris Wallace, ""I can just tell you this, Chris. Since President Obama has been in office, we've reached the point we're cutting the annual deficits in half, and we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.""On first glance, the data doesn’t seem to back up the claim that ""the overall debt of the United States"" is poised to drop by $3 trillion -- or even by a dime -- over the next decade.A quick refresher: The deficit is a fiscal shortfall for one year, while the debt is the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus any surpluses.In it, CBO estimated the amount of publicly held federal debt for each of the next 10 years. In 2014, the debt is pegged to be $12.7 trillion. By 2024, the debt is set to rise to almost $21.3 trillion. That’s an $8.6 trillion increase, not a $3 trillion decrease.We also checked to see whether Durbin was talking about a decrease in what CBO projected the debt to be 10 years out.When we checked with Durbin’s office, spokesman Max Gleischman said the senator was referring to ""the amount of deficit reduction Congress has already enacted,"" adding that ""he actually understates it by about a trillion dollars.""But look closely at the language: The center’s report consistently refers to the ""deficit,"" not the ""debt."" As we noted earlier, the deficit is a single year’s shortfall, while the debt is total money owed.Our rulingDurbin said that under current policies, ""we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.""That's a difference of ... $11.6 trillion. That's real money to anyone.We rate Durbin's claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Republican challenger Matt Bevin attacks Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's gun record,"""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights,"" the ad said. ""Matt Bevin always support the Second Amendment. The choice is clear.""So we took a deeper dive into this ad to see what it’s getting at.Dissecting the 1991 crime billThe ad isn’t referencing the gun debate of the last two years — or even of the last two decades.Instead, Bevin’s campaign points to a Senate vote from 1991, when McConnell was just starting his second term in office, to support the claim.Democrats, who controlled both chambers of Congress, were critical of the bill for not addressing ownership of assault weapons and other gun control measures. And though Bush called for the bill to be passed within 100 days, a contentious showdown ensued.The Senate version of the bill, called the Violent Crime Control Act of 1991 and proposed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., included an assault weapons ban from the outset and a seven-day waiting period to purchase handguns.The sprawling bill also sent $1 billion to local law enforcement agencies and courts, and expanded mandatory minimum sentencing and use of the death penalty.Senators filed hundreds of amendments to the legislation. Two of the most controversial dealt with gun ownership. A compromise measure shrunk the waiting period to purchase a handgun to five days and laid out parameters for a speedy federal background check. It passed with significant Republican support.McConnell’s campaign said he only backed the bill because he supported the tougher sentences and money for local police, and to push the bill into a conference committee with the House, where he hoped the gun measures would be removed.Bevin’s campaign said that ""is the classic Washington way of pretending you are against something in your state, but support the measure in Washington"" and he should have worked to defeat the measure entirely.Killing the billThe conference bill passed the House by two votes but stalled in the Senate for the rest of 1991 and 1992 under the threat of veto from Bush. With a filibuster in place, Senate Democrats couldn’t reach the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, despite three attempts, in part because the compromise bill had tighter gun restrictions.All three times the bill came up for a cloture vote to end debate, McConnell voted against it. Reid, however, voted to invoke cloture twice and once did not vote at all.Our rulingBevin’s ad says ""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights."" The ad focuses on a vote McConnell took more than 22 years ago on a massive crime bill that included dozens of votes and amendments and didn’t even pass Congress.The law failed, with McConnell voting against it, and Reid voting for it. On amendments, McConnell sided with firearm lobbyists when a closely watched provision came up for a vote. The only evidence the Bevin campaign offered was that McConnell voted to advance the bill to a conference committee (as did Reid), but that was a brief point in the legislative process. To hang this attack on a handful of long-ago votes — when he much more recently helped kill gun control legislation — is absurd.So overall, Bevin’s add goes back to 1991 to cherry-pick votes and make it seem like McConnell and Reid were on the same side. Actually, McConnell repeatedly voted against the 1991 bill, on both its gun restrictions and the overall measure. The claim that McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe gun rights is contradicted by many other votes, both then and now. The claim is not only wrong, but ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Top Rhode Island Democrat says Republicans in U.S. House have not passed a jobs bill,"In this era of high unemployment, it's always about jobs.Boucher argued that the idea of ""replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen,"" which wasn't exactly Prior's argument, ""is completely absurd.""""The House Republicans’ failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform.""We were intrigued and decided to see whether Boucher's jobs claim was correct.The list has lots of bills with the word ""jobs"" in the title, but that doesn't mean the proposals would actually create jobs.In addition, Republicans and Democrats tend to have different views on what constitutes a ""jobs bill."" For Democrats, that can mean legislation expanding or creating a government training program. For Republicans, that can mean bills shrinking government or eliminating regulations to help businesses.We went to Congress.gov, run by the Library of Congress. It lists the topics that a bill covers. We looked for topics related to employment and job creation. It's not a perfect gauge, but it's a nonpartisan guide. We also reviewed summaries of the bills and committee reports looking for references to jobs and employment.Some jobs bills were designed to create jobs by encouraging more energy production and distribution, such as proposals to expand offshore oil drilling or push the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which gives some environmentalists heartburn.Others on the list from our GOP reader seemed to have little to do with directly promoting employment, and Congress.gov doesn't list them in any employment-related categories.When we emailed the list of ""jobs"" legislation to Boucher, he took issue with some of the bills, saying they weren’t really about jobs.Boucher also argued that his statement is true because none of the Republican jobs-related legislation had been enacted.""When I wrote 'passing a jobs bill,' I was clearly referring to a bill that has passed into law,"" he said in an email statement. ""A bill can’t create a single job if it’s not actually passed into law.""But that's not what he said in his commentary.He said, ""The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill.""The House, regardless of which party is in control, cannot unilaterally enact laws. Approval by the Senate and (in most cases) the president are also required.Whether one thinks that the bills will do more harm than good is a matter for debate, and beyond the scope of this fact check."

PANTS-FIRE,John Cornyn voted against leadership's immigration plan at committee level and on Senate floor in 2013,"A Republican primary challenger to John Cornyn said in an email blast Jan. 31, 2014, that the senior senator for Texas is teaming with Barack Obama, the Democratic president, to ""ram amnesty down your throat.""U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood went on to say that no GOP leader is working harder for amnesty than Cornyn. More: ""Last year Cornyn helped pass Obama’s amnesty bill in the Senate.""We decided to check the to-the-point claim in the banner topping Stockman’s email: ""John Cornyn voted twice in 2013 to back Obama’s amnesty plan.""He did?We zeroed in on Cornyn’s votes, also exploring Obama’s connection to the plan.Our email to Stockman’s spokesman, Donny Ferguson, about Cornyn’s votes elicited no response. Cornyn’s campaign spokesman, Drew Brandewie, emailed us instances of Cornyn voting against the measure.Stockman’s email blast condemning Cornyn singles out two other votes as indicative of Cornyn helping to advance Obama’s plan. Stockman wrote: ""Cornyn voted with Democrats twice to kill our Republican filibuster of amnesty,"" adding that he was referring to two Senate votes that preceded days of floor debate.The blog post quoted Cornyn as saying that he voted to launch floor debate so he could offer a tighter border security amendment. ""The bottom line is that if border and national security cannot be guaranteed in this bill, I cannot and will not support it,"" Cornyn said.So, Cornyn voted against endorsing the immigration plan in committee, in favor of starting the Senate floor debate and against the legislation advancing to the House.Ready to dig in?From that moment through the Senate decision a week later to advance the immigration plan to the House, Cornyn was on the losing end of seven floor votes, including several related to considering and then accepting the alternative border security language. It looked to us like none of these votes could be interpreted as aligning Cornyn with the Senate’s Democratic majority or Obama.Summing up, Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute told us that he sees Stockman’s claim as a distortion. ""On a fundamental level, it’s a misleading statement. It’s not Obama and it’s not amnesty,"" Rosenblum said, ""but there were those two votes,"" he said, referring to Cornyn’s votes to let floor debate proceed.Our rulingStockman said Cornyn voted twice in 2013 for Obama’s amnesty plan.That’s inaccurate to a ridiculous degree.For starters, Obama never offered an amnesty plan, though he endorsed the Senate-approved legislation, which envisioned ways that unauthorized immigrants could attain citizenship. This was also the plan that Cornyn consistently voted against; the two ""aye"" votes singled out by Stockman were procedural, relating to whether floor debate commenced and not to the legislation's merits.Given that Stockman’s claim misrepresented both the immigration measure and Cornyn’s votes, it merits flames. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Chain email claims Barack Obama has signed 1,000 executive orders to grab power from Congress","In his State of the Union address last month, President Barack Obama said he doesn’t intend to wait if Congress doesn’t move forward on his priorities in 2014.""I'm eager to work with all of you,"" Obama said Jan. 28. ""But America does not stand still, and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.""That means using his executive office — ""I've got a pen and I've got a phone,"" he has taken to saying lately — to accomplish his agenda, if necessary.We also saw an old chain email resurface claiming that Obama has already issued more executive orders than any of his predecessors. It first gained attention in the fall of 2012.""This president is determined to take control away from the House and Senate,"" the email says, while providing a tally of presidential executive orders from Teddy Roosevelt to Obama. The email claims Obama issued 923 executive orders in his first 3.5 years and ""More than 1000+ and counting executive orders in six years.""But several readers sent it to us again, and since the issue of executive authority has become newsworthy of late, we thought this deserved an update.By the numbersThe tradition of executive orders dates back to our first president, George Washington, though it was used sparingly through the first 100 years of the union.Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he can (and plans to) raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour.The process picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder.After Grant, it became commonplace for presidents to issue more than 100 executive orders. In fact, four presidents have eclipsed 1,000 executive orders: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (Notice Obama is absent from that list.)Franklin Roosevelt holds the record with 3,522 executive orders during his 12-plus years in office.But according to the chain email, FDR used his pen infrequently and issued a paltry 11 executive orders -- another inaccuracy.PresidentFranklin Roosevelt113,522Harry Truman7907Dwight Eisenhower2484John F. Kennedy4214Lyndon Johnson4325Richard Nixon1346Gerald Ford3169Jimmy Carter3320Ronald Reagan5381George H.W. Bush3166Bill Clinton15364George W. Bush62291Barack Obama1000+168**As of Jan. 20, 2014It’s obvious the chain email is way off. Not only is Obama far from the most prolific user of executive orders, at this point he’s not even on pace to surpass President George W. Bush’s total. In fact, unless he picks up speed, Obama will likely sign fewer executive orders than any two-term president since the start of the 20th century.Judging the actsThat’s not the only part where the chain email invokes an alternate reality. It also lists 14 executive orders Obama signed that allegedly usurp traditional executive powers, including things like seizing control of the media, railroads, waterways and correctional institutions. The email invited us to ""Feel free to verify the ‘executive orders’ at will.""When we looked up the specific executive order numbers that the chain email mentioned, we found that they were all signed by other presidents. Also, those order numbers matched up with executive orders on either entirely different topics or orders that were much more limited in scope. Here's the rundown:  Executive order numberWhat it actually doesWho actually signed itNo. 10990Allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.Created the Federal Safety Council in the Department of Labor to improve workplace safety for federal workers and civilian contractorsKennedyNo. 10995 Allows the government to seize and control the communication media.Assigned telecommunications management functions KennedyNo. 10997Allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of the Interior KennedyNo. 10998 Allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of Agriculture KennedyNo. 11000Allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of Labor KennedyNo. 11001Allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. KennedyNo. 11002Designates the registration of all persons.

It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months.Adjusted emergency preparedness assignments to organizational and functional changes in Federal departments and agencies Ford Many of the executive orders listed above deal with the Defense Protection Act passed by Congress in 1950 and reauthorized repeatedly since then. According to the Congressional Research Service, the act says ""authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.""Obama has signed subsequent executive orders similar to the ones issued by Kennedy, Johnson and Ford that deal with emergency preparation, but they don’t create a state of martial law, like the email implies. The Congressional Research Service even said in 2000 that the Defense Protection Act ""has nothing whatever to deal with martial law.""Our rulingThe chain email said Obama has issued more than 1,000 executive orders. That’s not even close. As of Jan. 20, 2014, he was at 168. The email also infers that Obama has far surpassed his predecessors in using his executive powers. That, too, is way off. FDR signed off on more than 3,500 executive orders, and, in fact, Obama is on pace to issue fewer executive orders than any two-term president since 1900.As for the 14 executive orders highlighted in the email? Obama didn’t issue any of them. They came from Kennedy, Johnson and Ford. Almost all of them have been revoked.Overall, the statements in this email seem to be completely made up. So we rate its claims Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Ann Coulter says a friend's sister ""died from Obamacare"" because Blue Shield of California left","Of all the reasons Republicans oppose Obamacare, none is more stark than death.Coulter zipped through the backstory:The woman ""had been thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California.""The woman tried to ""get on Obamacare, (but) couldn’t get through the website."" Then she got a fever, but she didn’t want to go to the emergency room without insurance. On Thursday, the woman went into septic shock, Coulter said, and went to the hospital.Coulter recounted the story in a Saturday speech. ""I got up to my hotel room after the speech and my friend sent me an email saying, ‘My sister died from Obamacare,’ "" she said.Carlson responded, ""That is completely shocking.""Coulter added that she asked her friend if she could tweet the sister's story, and ""She said, 'Julie would be very happy for you to tweet this.' ""We don't know the name of the woman (beyond Julie), the type of coverage she had or anything about her medical history, and Coulter did not respond to our request for more information. But the claim that someone ""died from Obamacare"" because Blue Shield ""completely just pulled out of California"" is something we can fact-check.It’s obviously misleading to say someone died from Obamacare in the same way someones dies from cancer or a car accident. Hospitals in the United States are required to treat patients whether they have health insurance or not.But more germane to this particular fact-check is Coulter’s assertion that the woman found herself without insurance because Blue Shield pulled out of the state of California.That did not happen.Blue Shield of California: Still in businessThe not-for-profit insurer competes with for-profit insurer Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente. It continues to be a big player in the individual marketplace, which is what we assume Coulter is talking about, as well as the state’s health exchange, Covered California.Like other insurers across California and the country, Blue Shield of California could no longer offer some health insurance plans because they did not include ""essential health benefits"" required by the Affordable Care Act.The letter explained Blue Shield would offer new plans that include the minimum health benefits required by the health care law, such as emergency services, prescription drugs and preventive care.If a customer took no action after reading the letter, he or she would be automatically enrolled into a new plan recommended by Blue Shield. This was meant ""to ensure that no one experienced a lapse in coverage,"" said spokeswoman Mia Campitelli.For a customer to be without Blue Shield coverage after getting the letter, he or she would have had to contact Blue Shield to cancel the recommended plan. Campitelli said the company would not have a number for how many people chose to drop Blue Shield until open enrollment ends after March.Trouble with the website?Coulter said her friend’s sister tried to get Obamacare but couldn’t get through the website. (That’s assuming she canceled her Blue Shield coverage.)Our rulingCoulter said a friend’s sister ""died from Obamacare"" because she was ""thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California.""We're not fact-checking whether someone died. We're looking at the circumstances Coulter presented.Blue Shield did not pull out of California, and the company did not leave people without insurance. In fact, customers were allowed to keep their existing insurance plans through March. If the basic facts of Coulter’s story are accurate, the woman in question elected to drop insurance coverage.Whatever the story of Blue Shield, saying someone died ""from Obamacare"" is incendiary and grossly misleading.Coulter’s claim rates Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,John Cornyn claim that a quarter of human trafficking victims are located in Texas relies on outdated limited-scope figure,"""Tragically, these horrendous crimes are occurring at an alarming rate in our own state,"" the Texas Republican said. ""25% of human trafficking victims are located in Texas."" The email went on to mention Cornyn’s introduction of legislative proposals to ""help law enforcement track down and prosecute these criminals, and provide support for the victims of these crimes.""The sheet says: ""25% of all human trafficking victims are in Texas,"" attributing that without elaboration to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.‘Certified’ victims onlyThe Children at Risk report gives detail, stating: ""In the last quarter of 2007, 30% of the calls received by the National Human Trafficking Hotline originated in Texas and 25% of all international victims certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were located in Texas. As of the date (of) publication, the National Human Trafficking Hotline receives more calls from Texas than from any other state.""According to the report, Texas is a ""hub for international human trafficking because of its many busy interstate highways, international airports, bus stations, the shipping commerce through the Gulf of Mexico, and its shared border with Mexico… Texas is also a hotspot for domestic human trafficking because cities such as Dallas, Houston and Austin have many runaway and homeless youth.""By email, Dawn Lew, a staff attorney for Children at Risk, told us the reference to the last quarter of 2007 applied only to the hotline calls and said the 25 percent reference reflected the percentage of all international trafficking victims ""certified"" by the HHS who were located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006.Another Children at Risk official called and said Cornyn’s statement could have been worded differently.The official, Mandi Kimball, later said by email that Cornyn’s 25 percent reference was in the context of talking up his legislation targeting trafficking within the United States.""We have no idea how many people are being trafficked in Texas or any state for that matter,"" Kimball wrote. ""We do know that 25% of the"" foreign ""victims located and certified in the country from April 2004-January 2006 were located in Texas. Cornyn is not saying that 25% of the victims were being trafficked in Texas, he stated that they were located in Texas. This is the 25% number that people are going by, because it is the only concrete data and number we have to go by, and this data is from"" HHS.Do these counts add up?Generally, Lew said earlier, states are under-estimating trafficking victims. ""This is because it is difficult and nearly impossible to quantify the true number of victims,"" Lew said. ""Why? Because victims often don’t self-identify as victims, some are misidentified and charged as criminals for related offenses (drugs, criminal trespass, etc.), and others, due to the clandestine nature of human trafficking, are hiding in plain sight and may never encounter law enforcement or social service providers,"" Lew wrote.""In addition, although human trafficking has always existed, until recently, not all states even had a state law on human trafficking, which contributes to the lack of information at the state level on the number of victims identified, traffickers convicted, etc.,"" Lew said. ""Certification numbers are some of the only concrete data that we have with respect to the number of human trafficking victims in each state, and it’s clear that many of the victims are being certified from Texas. Again, keep in mind that certification only captures a percentage of international victims, and does not include domestic victims at all. So the problem in Texas, as in most every state, is larger.""At Lew’s suggestion, we reached Maria Trujillo, executive director of the Houston Rescue and Restore Coalition, which says its mission is educate the public, train professionals and empower the community to act toward identifying, rescuing and restoring trafficking victims to freedom.By phone, Trujillo said the Cornyn-cited statistic may have held up in 2006--though then solely for adult victims from outside the United States, since certification does not sweep in citizen-victims. Also, she said, the government has not released figures since then that would bring the estimate up to date.After 2006, Trujillo said, the government stopped estimating the number of certified adult victims on a state-by-state level, though national figures continued to be available.Kenneth Wolfe, spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, which is an HHS agency, told us by email that it is unable to calculate how many victims of human trafficking are in the United States or within any state. Wolfe said the agency has not lately reported which states got the most letters certifying international victims ""because the information might be misinterpreted as the location of the trafficking, which is often not the case."" Nationally in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, he said, such letters were provided to victims or their representatives in 38 states. Certified victims, he said, came from 55 countries.Texas vs. the worldWe were curious to see how the scope of trafficking in Texas stacks up with other places in the world, some of them notorious for human trafficking. Cornyn’s statement, after all, said that 25 percent of trafficking victims are in Texas just one sentence after he said that ""people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking.""Informed of the unavailability of recent estimates and the fact that the original estimate was limited to certified victims from outside the country, Mitchell of Cornyn’s office said by email that his statement relied on the ""most recent Texas-specific data available.""Our rulingCornyn said 25 percent of trafficking victims are located in Texas.This claim seemingly draws on an outdated percentage for a subset of the planet’s trafficking victims, that is, ""certified"" adult victims from outside the U.S. described some five years ago as located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006--and that calculation did not account for U.S. citizen-victims.We did not find an estimate of the share of the world’s trafficking victims located in Texas, though the 2012 U.N. estimate seems to show that Texas is not home to a huge share; victims are more prevalent in Asia and Africa than in the developed world, the report said.All told, this claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Are Monica Wehby and Jason Conger 'causing devastating consequences' for unemployed Oregonians?,"One of the most contentious issues that Congress has faced since before Christmas break is whether to extend unemployment benefits for an estimated 1.6 million Americans.Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., have yet to agree on a plan. Senate Democrats generally favor an extension, while Republicans insist that any extension be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. The temporary extended benefits, meanwhile, expired Dec. 28, 2013.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a D.C.-based group dedicated to maintaining Democratic control of the upper chamber, waded into the issue. In a Jan. 15, 2014, news release, Justin Barasky, the group’s national press secretary, blamed the lack of extension, in part, on two Oregon Republican senatorial candidates -- Portland physician Monica Wehby and state Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend.Both hope to oppose the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jeff Merkley, in the November general election.""Monica Wehby and Jason Conger’s reckless refusal to support the renewal of unemployment benefits is causing devastating consequences for nearly 23,000 Oregonians looking for work and hurting the state’s economy more each day,"" Barasky wrote.Are Wehby and Conger ""causing devastating consequences"" for unemployed Oregonians? PolitiFact Oregon wondered how that could be, since neither candidate is even in the Senate.We contacted the Wehby and Conger campaigns.Conger, now in his second term in the Oregon House, confirmed on KXL’s ""The Lars Larson Show"" on Jan. 8, 2014, that he would not vote to extend unemployment benefits if he were in Congress.He told PolitiFact Oregon: ""I don’t think another extension of benefits will actually help people who have been long-term unemployed and already extended multiple times.""Wehby, in a statement, said she supports a temporary extension of benefits, but added, ""We need to find a way to pay for these extensions by cutting government waste.""However, representatives of both campaigns noted that neither candidate is in the U.S. Senate, so neither has any direct say on the issue.We contacted Barasky, who defended his assertions in an email.Regarding the candidates’ positions on benefits extensions, he referred to the original news release. It underscored Conger’s statements to Larson, which Conger confirmed. It also cited a Jan. 14, 2014, news story that ran on mycolumbiabasin.com that said that Wehby, following a swing through the state to meet with business owners, indicated ""she’s not so sure it’s the right way to go.""Barasky said another quote in the story demonstrates Wehby’s opposition to an extension. The story said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., disputes the idea that long-term benefits dissuade workers from returning to work. It then added, ""Wehby thinks Wyden is wrong.""""How is that anything but opposition?"" he wrote us. In our reading, however, Wehby was disputing Wyden’s take only on the effect of unemployment extensions.The question of an unemployment benefits extension did not come up at a debate last Saturday among GOP candidates, including Conger and Wehby, hoping to take on Merkley. If it had, Conger said he would have said no, but told us he commiserates with those looking for work. Wehby said she would have answered yes -- with the qualifier that any extension be paid for through spending offsets elsewhere. That pokes a hole in Barasky’s assertion that both candidates oppose an extension.On the larger question of whether the candidates are ""causing devastating consequences"" to unemployed Oregonians, Barasky said, ""We know they aren’t in the Senate, and our release doesn’t pretend they are. We are saying, if they were in the Senate, this is how they’d be voting and those votes would be hurting unemployed Oregonians.""But that’s not what his statement says. It accuses Conger and Wehby, through ""reckless refusal,"" of ""causing devastating consequences"" -- present tense -- for Oregon’s unemployed workers.That’s just wrong; neither is in a position to cast a vote on the issue, let alone cause ""devastating consequences"" for Oregonians. Even if one is elected to the Senate, he or she won’t be sworn in for nearly a year. Barasky, given the chance to revise the claim, doubled down, saying he was on ""solid ground."" We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert says 40 years ago, 'hardly anybody' in the U.S. had health insurance","Gohmert told him, ""When Obamacare actually kicked in, just as we knew, if you liked your insurance, as I did -- I had a health savings account -- then I wasn't going to be able to keep it because it doesn't meet the requirements."" Gohmert continued, ""I don't have an extra $1,200 a month. And we are setting money aside in the event we need it. But Brian, don't forget, you know, 40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance, and this is one of the areas we really need reform in.""For this fact-check, however, we wondered whether Gohmert was right that ""40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance.""Gohmert’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry, but right off the bat, we knew there was a problem with this claim. Forty years ago was 1974 -- almost a decade after the creation of Medicare (the universal health care program for Americans age 65 and up) and Medicaid (the health care program for qualifying low-income Americans).But maybe Gohmert was talking only about private insurance. So we located data on that, too.Michael Tanner, a health-policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that 40 years ago, insurance may have been more likely to cover big-ticket items such as hospital care and less likely to cover smaller, more routine medical procedures.Still, not even these figures help Gohmert’s case, since even the lower percentages for non-hospital care aren’t anywhere near the trivial numbers of insured Americans Gohmert claimed.Gohmert’s statement is ""just flat wrong,"" Wilensky said.Our rulingGohmert said that ""40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance."" Even ignoring the millions of Americans covered in 1974 by Medicare and Medicaid, 80 percent of Americans under age 65 back then had private insurance coverage, and a solid majority of those plans covered routine doctor visits and prescription drugs in addition to hospital care. These numbers are so far off from Gohmert’s claim that we rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"On average, 20 to 25 cents of every $1 spent on four government assistance programs is lost to fraud, Sen. Ron Johnson says","When a woman asked Johnson about the Internal Revenue Service enforcing provisions of the Affordable Care Act, he expressed doubt about how effective the IRS would be.Then Johnson made an allegation about government assistance programs that packed the punch of a beer and a shot.""Do you realize the average rate of fraud,"" Johnson asked, ""whether it's in the Earned Income Tax Credit or Medicare or Medicaid, across the board, food stamps -- the average rate of fraud in those programs is 20 to 25 percent?""Are errors made in the programs Johnson cited -- people who aren’t eligible still getting benefits, or getting more than they should?Sure -- tens of billions of dollars worth per year.But in terms of fraud, there’s no evidence the rate in the four programs is anywhere near 20 or 25 percent.Johnson’s responseWhen we asked for evidence to back Johnson’s claim, Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator meant error rates in the various programs, not actual fraud.""The former is of interest to taxpayers, the latter is a matter for prosecutors,"" McIlheran said in an email.The next day, however, Johnson conceded he had erred -- even though he continued to use the term fraud.In a statement, Johnson said that when he made his claim, he was ""primarily referencing fraud"" in the Earned Income Tax Credit program.But, he added:""I made too broad a generalization to other mandatory spending programs based on reports in the press and from colleagues that are not supported by other inspector general reports. I strive hard to convey accurate information that is fully supportable, and I was mistaken in making this overly broad generalization,"" the statement read.""This inaccuracy, however, should not detract from the larger point I was trying to make: Fraud is a significant and serious problem.""The error rate was 4.7 percent.So, the senator admits his claim is false; let’s see just what the numbers are.Before we review each of the four programs Johnson singled out, it’s important to note the difference between fraud and error rates.As Malcolm Sparrow, a specialist in corruption control at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told PolitiFact National, fraud and improper payments are far from identical.""There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment,"" he said.We found that reviews done by federal agencies, as well as by independent offices such as inspectors general and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, do not cite rates of fraud. Rather, they document or estimate error rates -- how often benefits in various programs are overpaid or underpaid.Such improper payments can include instances of actual fraud, but by and large they cover errors, which can be made by government workers, service providers such as physicians, and by the benefit recipients themselves. Some of the errors could be intentional, such as a taxpayer claiming a credit he isn’t eligible for, but the nature of fraud makes it very difficult to quantify. In other instances, a caseworker might mistakenly arrange benefits for someone who isn’t eligible.Food stampsMedicareFraud makes up a relatively small portion of the improper payments, according to the factcheck done by PolitiFact National. More common are improper payments that are the result, for example, of a doctor ordering too many tests, or providing a service but submitting the wrong payment code.MedicaidThe rate of error payments in Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, is lower than it is for Medicare.Earned Income Tax Credit The Earned Income Tax Credit gives a federal income tax credit to low- and moderate-wage workers. A taxpayer who gets the credit could owe less in income taxes or receive a larger tax refund.The IRS said faulty payments result from a variety of causes, including the complex nature of the law, the shifting EITC-eligible population and the nature of the credit.And it bears repeating: these are error rates, not rates of fraud.Our ratingJohnson said: ""The average rate of fraud"" in the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps programs ""is 20 to 25 percent.""Improper payment rates are in the 20 to 25 percent range in the tax credit program -- but are 10 percent or less in the other three programs. So, even the average among the four programs would be far less than what Johnson claimed.More importantly, those are error rates; there are no figures on the rate of fraud, which is believed to be a small component of errors. Johnson’s remark to the group was grossly misleading.   For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Johnson a Pants on Fire.   "
PANTS-FIRE,"Cullen says Abele security detail equals those for governor, mayor -- and saved taxpayers money","Sometimes it seems everything’s a fight at the Milwaukee County Courthouse.During last fall’s budget battle, even County Executive Chris Abele’s request for a personal security detail provided by a private firm or local law enforcement touched off a tussle.Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s reaction was basically no way: ""I won't spend one penny of taxpayer money on Abele's self-importance exercise.""Supervisor Jason Haas said Abele was wealthy enough to pay for his own security. Others noted Scott Walker had no security when he had Abele’s job. Abele said he’d received threats.After tempers cooled, County Supervisor David Cullen portrayed the outcome as a victory for Abele and the taxpayers.We can’t say what the appropriate level of spending is. But let’s check that last statement by the county supervisor.Did the move provide the same level of security, while saving money?How spending comparesFor the record, Abele believes the County Board-approved plan is inadequate.His spokesman, Brendan Conway, said Milwaukee Police officials privately estimated -- based on what it costs to protect Mayor Tom Barrett -- that it would cost $400,000 to protect Abele.MPD spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us that the $400,000 figure (it’s $500,000 including overtime) includes police presence in the entire municipal complex, not just for protecting and driving Barrett to events. Officers are stationed at the Treasurer’s office, for instance.It’s clear, though, from what police tell us that a significant chunk of the $400,000 covers Barrett, and that multiple officers are part of the team that protects and escorts him.By contrast, the county plan is limited to $100,000 and county supervisors say they were told the funds would cover salary and benefits for the equivalent of one full-time deputy.In addition, Conway said Clarke so far is talking about an on-call system, not a body attached to the exec’s office. In addition, Abele would only be escorted when outside the Courthouse. That would be different than the City Hall setup, where police provide security for Barrett both while working in his office and outside City Hall at various functions.As for Walker, who was elected governor in 2010, it’s clear that his security costs greatly exceed $100,000.Factors include a large increase in threats he and his family reported receiving in the wake of his Act 10 collective bargaining law, and the fact that his two sons lived at home in suburban Milwaukee during the height of the protests over the law. The governor has maintained separate residences in Madison and Wauwatosa.The costs of the governor's security detail totaled $611,400 over the 10 months from Walker's election in November 2010 to the end of August 2011, the Journal Sentinel reported at the time. That also covers the lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch.That was more than twice as much as it cost to protect then-Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle over the comparable 10-month period from November 2009 to August 2010. We could not get updated figures.As is readily evident to the public, a State Trooper squad is a fixture in the driveway of the Walkers’ home in Wauwatosa.In light of these facts, we asked Cullen about his newsletter claim that Abele would get ""the same level of security"" as Barrett and Walker.He told us he ""may have chosen my words inartfully,"" explaining that he meant only that professional law enforcement would protect Abele just as it does Walker and Barrett.""I wasn’t necessarily arguing it was the same level of man hours the governor or mayor gets,"" Cullen said.A day later, Cullen said it was possible the county and city security could be more comparable than at first blush.The comparison is not as straightforward as it seems, he said, because the county figure ($100,000) doesn’t include spending on the security checkpoints at the public entrances to the Courthouse. Those checkpoints, staffed primarily by security-trained county facilities employees and lately with help from sheriff’s deputies, give the Courthouse a security dimension lacking at City Hall.True, but it’s hard to get past the fact that Barrett gets close personal attention inside and outside City Hall, while Abele would only have escorts outside the Courthouse -- and possibly only on an on-call basis.In sum, we think Cullen’s claim would read to most people as comparable security presence for Abele and the other two officials, and it falls way short of that.Is it a savings?What about the $300,000 savings Cullen claimed from the County Board’s action? He bragged about it in his newsletter under the headline, ""County Board Adopts a no-tax increase Budget While Protecting Core Services.""While it’s true the board slashed Abele’s security request by that amount, the money was not used for tax relief. Instead, the money went for new spending: The County Board shifted the $300,000 through a budget amendment to beef up the county’s existing support of emergency homeless shelters.Finally, what will happen now that Abele and Clarke -- bitter personal and political rivals -- have to work out a security plan?""Now in his narcissistic way (Abele) feels his security should be funded without question as to cost,"" Clarke told us. Conway’s response: Clarke has made clear he has the authority to provide whatever function he wants.Clarke, who is certified in dignitary protection work, declined to discuss how the department would arrange protection for Abele, citing the need to keep such details secret for safety reasons. He called it a ""gross breach of security"" for Conway to discuss it with the media.Last fall, an Abele aide told county supervisors Abele would want to hand-pick the sheriff’s deputy assigned to him.We’ll have to stay tuned to see if he picks the sheriff for the job.Our ratingCullen said action by the Milwaukee County Board will ""provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000.""There are major problems with the claim, which Cullen acknowledges was poorly phrased.Cullen emphasized how much the County Board’s action would save taxpayers, but there is no real savings. It actually costs taxpayers more money.Abele’s personal security would fall far short of the governor’s and also appears to be less intense than that accorded to Mayor Tom Barrett. Cullen now says he meant only that Abele would have law enforcement security as do those two officials. But his newsletter said ""same level.""For these reasons, we rate his statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Fox News host says Americans don't know their history, then flubs history of Boston Tea Party","Americans, on the other hand, have gotten lazy and complacent, she suggested.""If you ask most people, they don’t even know why we left England,"" she said. ""They don’t even know why some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea. Most people don’t know that.""We can’t fact-check what Americans do or do not know. But what’s clear is there appears to be no story of ""some guy in Boston"" getting ""his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea.""Early American history experts were generally puzzled over what Tantaros was talking about and thought she might have mashed a few Revolutionary War-era stories together. Neither Tantaros nor Fox News responded to our request for clarification.But our experts were certain on a couple of things:Many prominent colonists objected, arguing that under British law colonists could not be taxed without having representation in parliament.The 1773 Tea Act, which spawned the Boston Tea Party (and more than 200 years later was part of the inspiration for the tea party political movement), did not increase taxes on tea, said University of North Texas associate professor Guy Chet.Point being: No secret, and no direct effort to increase the tax.Chet said Tantaro may have been referencing violence against British customs officers attempting to enforce existing taxes on tea.""Just as a matter of ballistics, it'd be pretty difficult to blow someone's head off with 18th century weaponry unless you were using artillery,"" Carp said. ""Although maybe you could do the trick with small arms; you'd have to ask a weapons expert.""Our rulingTantaros, in lamenting Americans’ knowledge of U.S. history, said, ""Some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea.""The man responsible for the original tax died of a fever in Britain.We rate her claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Scott Walker plans to end income tax, more than double sales tax, Democrat Mary Burke says","As her gubernatorial campaign was getting its sea legs, Mary Burke knocked Gov. Scott Walker for curtailing collective bargaining for most public employees, spurning federal money to expand Medicaid and failing to create jobs as quickly as he promised.With the turning of the calendar, Burke’s scope widened and her rhetoric sharpened.""Walker's tax plan is a tax hike,"" Burke claimed. ""It increases taxes for nearly 80 percent of the people in the state and we shouldn't think about it being anything other than a tax hike that falls on those who are least able to afford it. Eighty percent of the people in the state would pay more money.""She added:""It's going to kill jobs. If you can imagine a hike from 5-1/2 to 13-1/2 percent  in sales tax, every single business along any of our borders should be deeply concerned. People would leave and just drive across the border, buy their goods there. You think about a person who's thinking about buying a new car. That's an extra $1,000 or more on top of that price.""Let’s slow down a bit.So is Walker pushing a plan that would more than double the state sales tax, resulting in 80 percent of residents paying more in taxes overall?Income taxThe income tax question to Burke followed comments Walker made about tax reform during at least four media interviews in December 2013 and January 2014.Let’s start with Walker’s comments, to see whether he has a plan to shift from the income tax to the sales tax.Walker said those changes could involve both outright cuts, and shifts of income or property taxes onto the sales tax. But he said he wouldn’t commit to any plan until after consulting with business leaders and the public.""I don't have any preconceived notion on this. It's not like I have one goal,"" the governor said. ""The only goal is I want the overall tax burden to go down every year I'm in office. … What we're trying to do is have these early discussions that aren't threatening.""""If you look across the country -- some of the top performers, when it comes to job creation in the states -- are states that either have no income tax or very low income taxes,"" he said. ""I’m intrigued by that; I think there’s a lot of merit to that. But what I want to hear back from taxpayers is, is that the right way to go?""Walker added:  ""As part of that -- a year out, spending the time really listening before acting -- is if we think removing income taxes entirely is the right way to go, how do we replace that?""We don’t have a specific plan on the table.""""It would protect people who have the lowest incomes the most if you could carve out those basic essentials out there,"" Walker said. ""And then, say, you want to spend more on things that may not be essential to your life and your livelihood, well then the sales tax is going to be a part of it.""Huebsch said at the time that raising the sales tax to about 13 percent would allow the state to eliminate the income tax, and that Walker was considering eliminating the income tax. But the news report said nothing of any plan.So, Walker has expressed interest in the idea of eliminating the income tax and acknowledged that such a move would require recovering at least some of that revenue by raising the state sales tax. But he has said repeatedly it’s a concept he wants to discuss with the public for at least a period of months before any plan is considered.And he has said it is important to ""protect people who have the lowest incomes"" if any change were to go forward.Burke, however, framed the issue as if there is a specific plan on the table to eliminate the income tax entirely, and then took it a step further by asserting that plan would more than double the sales tax.Sales taxThe second part of Burke’s claim is that Walker’s plan would raise the state portion of the sales tax from 5.5 percent to 13.5 percent. Moreover, she says that would result in nearly 80 percent of residents paying higher net taxes.To be sure, there is no specific plan. But let’s dig a little deeper on the numbers.For example, a taxpayer in the lowest 20 percent by income ($14,000) would pay nearly $750 more in taxes on average, according to the blog post. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent (average income exceeding $1 million) would receive a tax cut averaging nearly $44,000.The blog post ended by saying: ""There’s a lot we don’t know yet about what the governor plans for the income tax. But one thing is clear: repealing the income tax would mean that all but the wealthiest taxpayers would be paying more in taxes, not less.""The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance notes that the wealthy pay disproportionately more of the state income tax and the poor spend more of their earnings than the wealthy do. That means high-income earners typically fare much better than the poor when the income tax is lowered and the sales tax is raised.So, mathematically speaking, revenue from the state income tax is equal to the revenue that would be collected by raising the state sales tax to roughly 13.5 percent.But Walker hasn’t proposed raising the sales tax to that level. And when he has talked about a shift in the state’s tax system, he has noted that exemptions on necessities such as food and clothing could be included to ease the impact of a higher sales tax on low-income residents.Beyond that, we can’t evaluate the fiscal impact of a plan that is not on the table -- yet that is precisely what Burke does in her claim.Our ratingBurke said Walker's income ""tax plan is a tax hike. It increases taxes for nearly 80 percent of the people in the state.""Walker wants to explore the possibility of eliminating the state income tax, which likely would trigger some increase in the state sales tax. But he has not advanced a plan to eliminate the income tax, nor to raise the sales tax by any particular amount.For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Has Rep. Tina Kotek, D-Portland, ever held a job?","The meteoric rise of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook has not been lost on politicians. Rare is the officeholder or candidate who doesn’t take advantage of social media’s inexpensive platforms to reach targeted audiences.Still, rules and etiquette remain murky. Most users understand that using all-caps is like yelling, but finer points remain a work in progress.Conservative radio talk-show host Bill Post, a newly announced Republican candidate for the Oregon House, got into a spirited back-and-forth Jan. 9 on Twitter with Carla Axtman, an editor for Blue Oregon, a left-leaning political blog.When Post held himself out as a ""real citizen legislator,"" Axtman shot back that ""we need a professional legislature now. The citizen leg model is rinky dink.""Post asked Axtman to define ""professional."" Then, referring to the Democratic speaker of the House, he added: ""Tina Kotek? What profession is she? Never held a job nor run a business.""We wondered if that was true. Has Kotek never held a job or run a business? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check.We emailed Kotek’s Salem office and received a reply from Jared Mason-Gere, her communications director. He provided details of Kotek’s work history, a couple of which are also listed on her official website.""Most recently she has been a self-employed independent contractor working as a management consultant for nonprofit organizations,"" Mason-Gere wrote of Kotek, who was first elected to House District 44 representing parts of North and Northeast Portland in 2006. Before that, he said, she was policy director for Children First For Oregon after spending several years working for the Oregon Food Bank.""Like the rest of us,"" Mason-Gere said, ""she also had a variety of jobs during and after college. While she was getting her Master’s degree, she worked as a graduate teaching assistant; she’s been a travel agent, office temp, and office administrator among other things."" When she was growing up in York, Pa., he added, she and her brother delivered the York Dispatch newspaper.Checks with both Children First for Oregon and the Oregon Food Bank confirmed that Kotek worked in the jobs indicated by Mason-Gere and her website.We called Post for a response. Asked first about his exchange with Axtman, he said, ""Twitter is Twitter. Twitter is yelling back and forth. I see Twitter as passing notes in high school. I don’t take it too serious.""Asked about Kotek, Post said, ""Define job for me. I don’t know her history. I just pulled that out of my hat.""At that point, Post excused himself, saying he needed to prepare for his afternoon radio show. We called him back afterward.He said the real point of his exchange with Axtman involved debating the merits of a citizen versus professional legislature. ""What Carla wants is a full-time paid legislature,"" Post said. ""I was goading her to say that out loud. I just threw a name out. It could have been (Oregon Senate President) Peter Courtney. It could have been anyone.""Informed of Kotek’s work history, he added, ""Is lobbying a job? I suppose it is. You get paid for it. I guess I’m wrong. That’s a job.""We circled back to Post’s initial dismissal of Twitter as akin to ""passing notes in high school,"" noting that his own Twitter account has been used to highlight guests on his upcoming radio shows and his various campaign events.He agreed that the medium has valuable uses, adding that he has an intern who posts on his account ""all day."" He acknowledged that he was the one in the back-and-forth with Axtman, though.The second part of Post’s claim, that Kotek has ""never run a business,"" is largely correct. Kotek has worked as a self-employed consultant, advising nonprofits on business operations, but she didn’t have business cards, a website or a state filing. Neither has she ever claimed to have run a business, Mason-Gere said.Post took to Twitter to argue with a blogger about the nature of the Oregon Legislature -- citizen or professional? In doing so, he claimed that Kotek had ""never held a job nor run a business.""Granted, use of social media such as Twitter and Facebook continues to evolve, but Post’s claim about Kotek’s job history is just plain wrong.She has, in fact held a number of jobs, including ranking administrative positions. Kotek hasn’t ""run a business"" in the traditional sense but has worked as a self-employed consultant. Post did later admit he was wrong on his assertion. But he also acknowledged that he made his claim about Kotek with zero research or knowledge -- noting, even, that ""It could have been anyone"" and ""I just pulled that out of my hat.""That shows an extreme disregard for the truth. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Limbaugh: 'Polar vortex' is made up, yet still proof the ice caps aren't melting","Those images of polar bears stranded atop tiny glaciers, looking very sad about their melting home in the North Pole, are phony, says radio host Rush Limbaugh. The lefty media created them to drive the discussion on global warming, which is also phony, he says.""Do you know what the polar vortex is? Have you ever heard of it? Well, they just created it for this week.""Here’s part of how he broke it down for his audience:""See, normally the polar vortex stays up there in the polar region, but something is causing it to dip down like it's never happened before. We've never had arctic air blasts before. And remember, now, the key to all this is you have to understand one of the fundamental concepts of man-made global warming is ice melting at the poles.""One of the ways they have always sought to convince you that the world is warming is not the climate where you live, but rather where you aren't, where you can't see what is really happening. So they tell you the ice is melting at the North Pole and the South Pole. And then they publish pictures, which are fraudulent pictures, of poor little polar bears stranded on three square feet of ice that you are told used to be the North Pole.""... Well, obviously there is no melting of ice going on at the North Pole. If they're gonna tell us the polar vortex is responsible for this cold, that means record cold is also happening in the North Pole, which means there isn't any ice melting.""PunditFact wanted to know: Does the unusual blast of cool air, which he says the media ginned up as the ""dreaded polar vortex,"" disprove global warming?""Polar vortex"" may sound new to Limbaugh, journalists and anyone who is not a weather expert, but it’s not a term the media cooked up to scare you. It’s been part of the conversation in meteorology circles since at least the 1940s and ‘50s, experts told us.The polar vortex is the region in the northern hemisphere that contains the planet’s cold or Arctic air. A warmer atmosphere lies outside of the vortex. The boundary between the regions is a jet stream of strong, fast-moving, frigid winds.Sometimes the jet stream is more symmetrical, encircling the polar region in an oval without many bumps. Other times, especially this week, its rotation breaks off into deep troughs, ushering cold air to the south. A polar outbreak occurs in areas that have big drops in temperature, where the polar vortex has dipped pronouncedly south.""It has been with us for eons,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""It will be with us for eons to come.""""This sort of jet stream pattern is what we expect to occur more often as the Arctic continues to warm faster than the rest of the globe in response to increasing greenhouse gases,"" she said. ""We can't say this particular event is caused by climate change, but it is becoming clearer that this sort of pattern should become more likely in the future.""Serreze says it is too early to tell whether one-time weather events like this polar outbreak are happening as a result of global warming.That said, the polar outbreak definitely does not disprove that Arctic sea ice is not melting, as Limbaugh concludes.Alarm over shrinking sea ice is based on how the region is shedding more and more of it by the end of summer -- as less ice covers the Arctic Ocean, the ocean absorbs more warmth. Historically, ice covering the Arctic sea is twice as big as the continental United States by winter’s end in March, Serreze said. As the ocean warms, ice melts.Around 1980, sea ice by summer’s end in September covered as much area as the contiguous United States, Serreze said. Lately, it’s shrunk to an area smaller than the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River.""The long-term trend in Arctic sea ice is sharply downwards, and this trend has the capability to cause significant alterations in jet stream behavior that can cause an increase in both warm and cold extreme events in the winter,"" said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at Weather Underground.Serreze labeled Limbaugh’s connection between the cold snap and sea ice as ""absurd.""Our rulingLimbaugh claimed the media made up the ""polar vortex"" to bolster global warming. What the cold snap does prove, he says, is Arctic sea ice is not melting -- that global warming is a hoax.Climate scientists told us his rant is wildly misinformed.The polar vortex has been a part of science for decades, and it certainly does not prove that sea ice is not melting.We rate this Pants on Fire!"

(Supporters are asked to give their names and addresses and click on a ""Sign"" button, but only the names of commenters are shown on the site.)DePetro has taken issue with most of the allegations. We were interested in the sexual-assault claim because it was news to us.""I have never been accused of 'sexual assault,' that is a complete lie,"" he said in his email. ""In July of 2012, I was accused of sexual harassment, but that is far different than 'sexual assault.'""A sexual harassment civil suit was indeed filed against him in 2012, not 2013, as the petition says. We read the complaint. It does not mention sexual assault, a criminal charge that can put someone in prison.In the filing, a former coworker accused DePetro of allegedly making sexual advances to her, showing her images of women that he said he was attracted to, and ultimately asking her if she would engage in group sex with him. DePetro has denied the allegations.(WPRO officials were also named in the suit. DePetro's supervisor was accused of not properly acting against the alleged infractions. However, there is no record in Superior Court that, in the 15 months since the suit was filed, any of the defendants have been officially notified that they're being sued.)We called Maureen Martin, chairwoman of For Our Daughters RI, to ask about the sexual-assault allegation. Martin is also political activities director of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, a labor union.Martin confirmed that the allegation in the petition referred to the 2012 sexual harassment suit. She asked to get back to us.However, the allegation of sexual assault was not modified.In a statement emailed that evening, Martin said that in the harassment complaint, DePetro's accuser ""alleges that Mr. DePetro made multiple 'sexual advances' toward her. These advances were unwelcome and 'inappropriate,' the complaint contends.""We checked the Justice Department's definition. The other half of the definition, which Martin did not quote, says: ""Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape."" Sexual harassment is not mentioned.Our rulingFor Our Daughters RI, in its petition calling for the removal of talk-radio host John DePetro, said, ""Earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker.""DePetro was accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in 2012, not 2013. The suit, which has laid dormant according to court records, never alleges sexual assault.Both sexual harassment and sexual assault are serious allegations. But the former is a civil matter and the latter can send you to prison, and relegate an ex-convict to a life of a registered sex offender.We would expect a group devoted to protecting women to know the difference. Yet For Our Daughters RI is standing by its allegation, selectively quoting from a federal definition of sexual assault and neglecting the fact that the definition does not include sexual harassment."
PANTS-FIRE,Bloggers say Obamacare coding system could usher in beheadings,"We’ve heard people give lots of reasons for opposing Obamacare. But until a reader sent us some Internet links recently, we hadn’t realized that one of the fears being spawned by Obamacare was that it could usher in legal beheadings across America.What’s going on here?One of the categories in ICD-9 is this one: ""Legal execution: All executions performed at the behest of the judiciary or ruling authority (whether permanent or temporary) as: asphyxiation by gas, beheading, decapitation (by guillotine), capital punishment, electrocution, hanging, poisoning, shooting, other specified means.""Anderson wrote that the connection between the coding system, Obamacare and legal execution would ""make any American’s hair stand up on the back of their neck.""

More importantly, as this summary makes clear, each state chooses its own method of execution, making the decision of what method to use beyond the reach for the federal government.Our rulingBloggers have recently offered posts headlined like this one: ""Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America."" But the coding system in question long predates Obama, and the ""beheading"" classification is only relevant for death statistics, not for insurance billing that would be under Obamacare’s purview.Finally, the beheading code is for statistical purposes, not for setting policy. Any change in legal execution methods would have to be approved by the states, not by the federal government. Bloggers, in a game of telephone, have turned a questionable claim into a ridiculous one.

PANTS-FIRE,Chris Christie claims 3 lanes off George Washington Bridge are dedicated to Fort Lee,"Hardly a day passes where vicious snarls don’t somehow tie up the George Washington Bridge.But those snarls aren’t limited to traffic. More and more, daily questions are arising from the September closure of some local-access lanes on the span. To date, they have resulted in the resignation of two high-ranking transportation officials and calls for a federal investigation into what’s become known as ‘Bridgegate.’And none of the questions are going away quietly.Among the latest claims to enter the fray? One by Gov. Chris Christie, who complained earlier this month about the local-access lanes for Fort Lee, where the bridge is located.""The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced,"" Christie said Dec. 2 in response to Democratic lawmakers subpoenaing the director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the bridge -- to appear before a state Assembly committee about the lane closures from Sept. 9-13. The closures caused massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, leaving some drivers stranded for hours.Three lanes of a 29-lane span (12 lanes on the upper level, 10 on the lower level and seven from the Palisades Parkway) dedicated to a relatively small borough in Bergen County? The governor isn't even close to correct.Let’s look at some numbers here.The 2012 census notes that Fort Lee’s land area is 2.54 square miles and the borough’s population that year was 35,732. And not all of those people are drivers or even users of the bridge connecting upper Manhattan with the borough.So why the hullabaloo about bridge lanes and Fort Lee? It goes to the September closures, when two of three local-access lanes were closed, purportedly for a traffic study, according to Port Authority officials questioned about the closures.Some Democrats have questioned whether the closures were political retribution against Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor for failing to endorse Republican Gov. Chris Christie for re-election last month..And the matter has continued to heat up.Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), chairman of the Assembly Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee, and an outspoken critic of the Port Authority, has convened hearings on the matter and issued subpoenas to Port Authority officials to testify about what happened. David Wildstein, the Port Authority’s director of interstate capital projects, who ordered the bridge’s general manager to carry out the closures, and agency Executive Director Bill Baroni have since resigned.On Dec. 10 the Port Authority’s inspector general launched an investigation into the closures and now U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, has asked the federal transportation secretary to investigate.Both Wisniewski and Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) are dumbfounded by Christie’s claim that the local access lanes are dedicated to Fort Lee.""These lanes are open to the general public,"" Wisniewski said. ""They’re physically located in Fort Lee but they’re not dedicated to Fort Lee.""I think it’s the word ‘dedicated’ to Fort Lee that creates the problem here,"" Wisniewski added. ""There’s an access point at Fort Lee that people (who live there) use and that many other people use.""Wisniewski explained that use of the access lanes in Fort Lee is similar to drivers using the New Jersey Turnpike Extension, for example, to get to the Holland Tunnel connecting Manhattan and Jersey City. It’s one way of using the tunnel, but not the only way.And Weinberg, who lives near the bridge, noted that there is no residency requirement for the people of Fort Lee or anyone else to use the bridge.""There are no specific dedicated lanes,"" she said. ""There are lanes that come from local streets in Fort Lee, but all lanes come through Fort Lee because the bridge is there. There are some local streets where you don’t have to get on the main highway.""Since neither Christie’s spokespeople, Port Authority spokespeople or even the Fort Lee Police Department would respond to requests for comment on the matter, the Truth-O-Meter went on the road last week to check out the local access lanes.We found that Wisniewski’s and Weinberg’s assessments are correct: there are lanes from local Fort Lee streets but none are dedicated specifically to the borough. Anyone can use them -- or not.Our rulingEarlier this month, in response to subpoenas being issued in the so-called ‘Bridgegate’ scandal, Christie said, ""The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced.""Christie is way off here. Never mind that his claim makes it seem as if a significant part of the bridge’s total number of lanes are dedicated to a borough with a land area only 2.5 square miles in size, with approximately 35,000 residents. The facts are that the George Washington Bridge is physically in Fort Lee and there are local access lanes from the bridge. But none of the lanes are dedicated for use only in or by the borough. All motorists are able to use them as an entry point to the span.Know what gets the Truth-O-Meter sauced, governor? Ridiculously false claims. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Fundamentalist: When founders said 'religion,' they meant Christianity","Christian fundamentalist talk show host Bryan Fischer said Satanism enjoys no such protection.We thought we’d go to the historic record to see if that claim hews closely to the facts.Fischer said in the second half of the 18th century, the overwhelming majority of the people were Christians. Jews accounted for less than 1 percent, Fischer estimated. The founders, he said, lived in a particular religion environment.""They weren’t providing any cover or shelter for the free exercise of Islam or even Judaism or even atheism,"" he said. ""They weren’t prohibiting that. They were just saying, that is not what we are talking about here.""""The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity,"" Story wrote, ""but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects.""At least some of the actual founders voiced contrary views.""The design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general,"" Franklin wrote. ""So that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.""""The insertion was rejected by a great majority,"" Jefferson wrote, ""In proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of every denomination.""John Ragosta, the Robert C. Vaughan Fellow at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, pointed us to that excerpt. Ragosta did not dispute that the great majority of people in America were Christians, but he said that makes the vision of the founders that much more impressive.""They were looking to the future,"" Ragosta said. ""They knew that other people would come to America … and that the rights that they were discussing were universal.""The historians we reached acknowledged that not every founder shared these beliefs. Still, those contrary views did not carry the day.Fischer also stated that the First Amendment did not apply to the states. Our experts agreed that originally, the states enjoyed the power to foster a particular religion.""Massachusetts retained their state church until 1833,"" Kidd said. ""Various states banned non-Christians from holding state office.""Our rulingFischer said that when the founders used the word ""religion"" in the First Amendment, they meant Christianity. Fischer cites one Supreme Court justice who expressed that view in 1833. On the other side, we have the writings of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and the opinions of scholars.We were unable to find much merit to this claim. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Viral post claims Barack Obama has begun a 'nationwide Muslim outreach program' for schoolkids,"Several readers recently asked us to check a claim that’s been spreading widely through chain emails and on social media -- that the Obama administration is pursuing a ""nationwide Muslim outreach program for children"" in grades K through 12.Here’s some of the text that usually accompanies the claim:""At a press conference today, President Obama announced plans for the first ever federally funded Muslim outreach program. The program will be available nationwide for all elementary school students grade K-12 beginning February 1st, 2014. The program is designed to educate children about the fundamentals of the Muslim religion and Islamic belief.""President Obama spoke with reporters to explain why it is so important that these outreach programs exist. ‘The Muslim community deserves our full understanding and respect,’ Obama said. ‘We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. These folks are not all bad. In fact, most of them are hard-working citizens just like you and me. I encourage every student in America to participate in your school’s Muslim outreach program. Learn about the Muslim community, the beauty of the Sunnah and the magic of the Qur’an.’""It closed by urging any parents of students who ""would like to volunteer and teach the Muslim religion"" to ""call the Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline at (202) 863-8500.""This all sounded fishy to us, so we checked with the White House, which confirmed that no such press conference had ever happened. Nor was there any such program.In addition, the phone number listed as being for the ""Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline"" was actually the phone number of the Republican National Committee. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski confirmed that the RNC had nothing to do with the piece. ""We’ve gotten calls from people giving us a heads up about this. We didn’t have anything to do with this and are telling people as much when they call,"" she said.Conservative Frontline did not offer any contact information on its website, so we were unable to reach its staff.Our rulingSocial media posts have reprinted or linked to a story titled, ""Obama Administration Announces Nationwide Muslim Outreach Program For Children Grades K-12,"" that claims, among other things, that school children can earn higher grades for studying Islam.  It’s not true. No such program exists. In fact, part of the story has been recycled from a previous satire article that we and others debunked. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,UPDATED: Scientific consensus remains that the planet is warming,"Barry Smitherman sees the planet as not warming.Candidate's backupRose quoted Curry, of Georgia, as saying the data confirmed a pause in global warming.""Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete,"" Curry said. ""Natural variability (the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun) has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance,"" Curry said.Debate about reconsiderationBy email, Curry didn’t directly answer whether the globe is warming: ""There has been no statistically significant increase in global average surface temperatures for the past 17 years.""Tobis continued: ""There's no doubt that CO2 is piling up in the atmosphere. There's no doubt that human activity caused it. There's no doubt that CO2 is a major factor in how energy flows through the climate system, and that changing it leads to a changed climate. There's practically no doubt that in the long run the planet will end up substantially warmer than it is. Figuring out how it gets from here to there matters a lot to human beings who live out our brief lives during the adjustment period. And there are some uncertainties there--it turns out transitions are harder to calculate than final outcomes. But nothing we see reduces our confidence in our understanding.""Like Tobis, though, Nielsen-Gammon said temperatures near the ocean surface have risen more slowly in the past 15 years or so ""than they had during the previous 35, and it is possible to find time intervals (such as the past five years) in which all weather station and satellite-based global temperature compilations show a declining trend. Overall, the global surface temperature trend is essentially flat since the dramatic and unusual warmth of the 1998 El Niño year.Nielsen-Gammon’s email continued: ""Just about everyone, including some of the sources quoted in the articles you listed,"" meaning the articles noted by Smitherman’s consultant, ""believes that the present lack of surface temperature warming is both natural and temporary. Climate model projections have generally been higher than observed temperatures, which depending on your interpretation means that natural variability has temporarily masked some of the warming or that the models have overestimated the amount of non-natural warming. The causes of the discrepancy are the subject of considerable research.""Cherry-picking a time period""These rising temperatures have serious consequences. Rising temperatures melt glaciers on land, including Greenland and Antarctica. As those melts make their way to the oceans, they cause sea levels to rise. And those rising sea levels are real and have been measured. Here’s a chart of sea level rise since the 1880s – you can see the steadily rising trend for yourself.Knapp closed: ""For our planet, that means as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the warmer the planet will get. Sure, there might be some short term anomalies – one year might be cooler than its preceding year, for instance – but the long term trend remains…""Texas and U.S. climatologistsBroadly, the Texas climatologists we reached said Smitherman got it wrong.""The Earth is warming,"" Nielsen-Gammon said.Hayhoe and Tobis each cautioned that cherry-picking start and stop years can lead to factually skewed conclusions about temperature trends.""If you cherry-pick short periods of time, you can end up with nearly any result you want,"" Hayhoe said. ""Only by looking at the entire dataset can you see what the truth is.""Another part of the draft, prepared by the 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee, said: ""Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. This evidence has been compiled by scientists and engineers from around the world, using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, buoys, and other observing systems. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming. U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation’s hottest on record.""Previous fact checksFrom another vantag point, recent fact checks do not support Smitherman’s statement.Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Neither increase exceeded what could have happened by chance.Naomi Oreskes, then a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter said: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change.""""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small.""Somerville described Smitherman’s offered articles as unscientific, adding: ""They misrepresent or ignore what climate science has actually discovered(.)""By email, Craighead of Smitherman’s campaign responded by stressing afresh the Easterbook presentation indicating a global cooling period since 1999.Our rulingSmitherman said the Earth is not warming.To the contrary, national, international and Texas climate authorities concur that the planet is warming. They also warn against cherry-picking individual climatic indicators or timeframes to conclude otherwise. That makes sense to us. In the end, this claim strikes us as both unfounded and ridiculous.Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Jeb Bush says Obama is closing the embassy to the Vatican,"‘Tis the season to make claims about holy matters.The Holy SeeNo country has an embassy to the Holy See within the Vatican City proper -- all of them are located within the city of Rome, according to the State Department. The current United States embassy is in a converted residential property in Rome, about 1.9 miles from the Vatican.The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See has seven U.S. diplomatic personnel, plus support staff. Its budget is just over $3.5 million, not counting costs associated with the local guard force, state department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told PolitiFact.""The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is, and will remain, among the largest foreign missions to the Holy See,"" she said.One of the report recommendations for the embassy to the Vatican was to ""relocate as soon as possible, with an eye towards cost savings, improved security, and maintaining as much as possible its separate identity to include a separate street address.""""It's turning this embassy into a stepchild of the embassy to Italy,"" Nicholson said. ""The Holy See is a pivot point for international affairs and a major listening post for the United States,"" he said, ""and to shoehorn (the U.S. delegation) into an office annex inside another embassy is an insult to American Catholics and to the Vatican.""The embassy shiftThe official stated that a few years ago, the government purchased land to expand an existing government compound in Rome and now plans to move the embassy there. The compound will have three separate buildings, each with their own entrances on different streets: the Embassy to the Holy See, the Embassy to the Republic of Italy and a U.S. Mission to the United Nations offices in Rome. The physical separation of the entrances is key because the Vatican requires embassies be separate from a country’s mission to Italy.The move was made due to cost and security, the State Department official told reporters. By consolidating operations at one compound, the state department expects to save about $1.4 million a year.The current embassy to the Vatican lacks ""the kind of physical security protection that we would like it to have,"" the official said. ""It doesn’t have the setback from the street that is available in its new compound, and … it does not have the level of other security protections, including Marine security guards that are available at the combined U.S. Government compound.""The State Department official emphasized that the move does not represent any downsizing of the United States diplomatic assets.""There is no reduction in diplomatic staff, there’s no reduction in ambassadors, there’s no reduction in mission,"" he said. ""There is simply a reduction in overhead.""""The United States is moving the location of the embassy to a building that is safer, bigger, and architecturally more appealing,"" Casey wrote. ""It also is slightly closer to Vatican City. Let me repeat that point: It's closer to Vatican City than the current location.""To be precise, the new site will be located 1.78 miles from Vatican City, about one-tenth of a mile closer than the current site. It is expected to open in 2015.Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for the Vatican were unsuccessful, but a spokesman for the Vatican told CNN that ""the move was well within the Holy See's requirements for embassies and that relations with the United States are far from strained. ... Another Vatican official, not authorized to speak on the record about diplomatic relations, told CNN the Holy See understands security concerns are an issue for some countries and this move is ""an exception, not the ideal, but not the end of the world.""""The Vatican itself said closing this location is not ideal,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told PolitiFact. ""Governor Bush does not believe this move reflects appropriate respect for the U.S. relationship with the Holy See.""So what to make of the conflicting accounts about whether the move is a slight to the Vatican?""I think it’s not a big deal,"" Stephen F. Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America, told PolitiFact. Schneck, who has been to the embassy, called it an ""ugly, modernistic residential structure."" (Schneck told us he is close to the current ambassador and a couple of past ambassadors, including those that served under Obama and Bush.)""While I wouldn’t actually call it unworkable, it's on a corner so it’s very accessible to street traffic,"" Schneck said. ""I certainly understand the security concerns.""Schneck emphasized that the roots of the move predate Obama, since it stems from an inspector general recommendation during Bush’s tenure. And he was dubious of the suggestion that the embassy move is retaliation for the Catholic bishops opposing the contraception mandate in Obamacare.""I stand with my Catholic bishops in support of the lawsuits on the contraception mandate,"" Schneck said. However, the embassy-Obamacare connection is ""a ridiculous effort, one of those crazy conspiracy theories to connect dots that make no sense at all.""Our rulingBush said, ""Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare.""For starters, the United States is not going to ""close"" its embassy -- it’s relocating it to a place that’s closer to the Vatican and that is more secure, less expensive and more architecturally distinctive. In addition, the move didn’t originate with Obama. It has been in the works since George W. Bush -- Jeb Bush’s brother -- was president. Finally, we found no evidence to support the idea that the relocation was related to battles over Obamacare. We rate Bush’s claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Allen West blames 'Obama's EPA' for closing a smelter as evidence of 'back door gun control',"Former Congressman Allen West has taken aim at a surprising gun control villain: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Here’s West’s explanation in a nutshell: The Doe Run lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri will close its doors this month due to air quality restrictions. ""What this all means,"" West wrote, ""is that after December 2013, any ammunition that will be available to US citizens will have to be imported, which will surely increase the price and possibly come under government control.""Lead’s dangersBut the long history of lead-control efforts casts serious doubt on the idea that the closure was driven by anti-gun concerns. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution.The Doe Run smelter, he says, was shut down because it was a major polluter -- not as a way of curbing guns.""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant.""The release explains that the company isn’t shutting down entirely. While the company is closing its primary smelter, which extracts lead from ore, it will continue to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products.According to the company, more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications.""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company release said. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri.""The company added that lead is used in ammunition and other materials. Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey emailed PolitiFact to say that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead.""We interviewed experts on lead or ammunition to ask about the impact of the plant closure. Most said there should not be major concerns.Michael Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, confirmed that lead used for ammunition made in the U.S. comes almost exclusively from recycled sources.Others agree. While Doe Run is the last ""primary"" lead smelter in the U.S. there are plenty of ""secondary"" processing of lead in the U.S., Richard Lowden, a research engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory told PolitiFact in an email.""Primary lead is of higher purity and is needed for specialty applications such as unique types of lead-acid batteries,"" Lowden said. ""Secondary lead is slightly less pure and is used in most applications -- over 80 percent of domestic consumption, including bullets. The U.S. imports very little lead, with the main foreign sources being Canada and Mexico. I do not  believe shooters have to worry about a source of lead for bullets.""Florida Bullet, a Clearwater-based company that supplies ammunition to most law enforcement agencies in Florida, isn’t worried about the smelter’s closure.The bullets the company sells, made by Federal and Speer, ""use reclaimed lead, so this is not going to bother us as far as production goes,"" said the company’s president, Tom Falone. ""We don’t foresee this being a problem for us.""When we asked Michele Hickford, West’s spokeswoman, why he blamed Obama if the EPA had zeroed in on the smelter long before Obama was president, she said, ""The plant closed under Obama. Regardless of what this lead plant is used for, the EPA net is tightening on the entire industry, and if you follow it to its logical conclusion, the industry will be shut down eventually. This is yet another example of the Obama administration circumventing the legislative process to achieve its goals.""Our rulingWest wrote that ""back door gun control is in full effect in the United States"" due ""to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency.""But there is no evidence that it was a clandestine effort at back door gun control. Rather, the EPA’s settlement with Doe Run -- which concluded a case that began years before Obama was elected president -- had to do with emissions of a chemical that can cause serious injury and death to adults and children. And ammunition experts shot massive holes in the notion that the smelter’s closure would cut production, reduce supply or raise the cost of ammunition. Pants on Fire!"

PANTS-FIRE,Gov. Scott Walker says typical Wisconsin homeowner will save $680 in property taxes over four years,"""This week, I signed a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief to Wisconsin’s families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses,"" Walker’s e-update said. ""With this bill, the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years.""A recipient of the governor’s email wrote us saying he had tried in vain to find fiscal estimates that back up Walker’s claim and asking us to investigate.So we did.This turns on a commonly used benchmark: The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s annual estimates of the size of the property tax bill for the owner of a property at the median value statewide.For example, under the policies in the 2013-’15 state budget, that tax bill was estimated at $2,974 on a $151,000 home.We wondered: Since the fiscal bureau’s official savings forecast is the aforementioned $33 over two years, where does the governor’s claim of $680 come from?Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster told us it’s from a hypothetical scenario.The governor compared the median tax bill expected during each of his four years to what they would have looked like if one assumes the trend line from 2006 to 2010 under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle had continued into Walker’s term. (The median bill went up 8 percent in Doyle’s last term.)So, the $680 is not actual money this median taxpayer ""will save"" on his or her property tax bill during the Walker years.It’s based on the assumption that another governor, faced with the same deficit Walker inherited, would have continued to allow local governments to raise property taxes at that 8 percent clip over an additional four years.Maybe, but maybe not.Problems in analysisOne problem with this is that Walker strongly links the $680 ""savings"" not to some hypothetical thing -- but to something very concrete: the $100 million relief legislation.It’s an even more bodacious claim, given that the $100 million in relief does not mean that the median tax bills will be lower in 2014 than in 2012, the period covered by the bill.That’s because the budget approved back in June resulted in a net increase (1 percent) in the projected median property tax bill over two years. The subsequent $100 million in relief trimmed the size of that increase -- but the median bill still goes up slightly.We’ve been down Hypothetical Road before with the governor.In the current case, another problem is that Walker’s email to residents doesn’t disclose that the $680 figure is a hypothetical one.True, Walker did point out the hypothetical scenario at the Capitol news conference announcing the $100 million bill and displayed a large chart explaining it.Same for two news releases the office sent out presenting the $680 figure in a broader context, linking it to ""property tax controls"" earlier in his term.But even the governor’s press events and announcements of the $100 million relief law have reflected confusion over his message. The evidence is in the wildly divergent media coverage.None of those descriptions hit the mark.Four-year bottom lineWalker did give one small clue in the e-update that his analysis wasn’t just on the two years covered by the $100 million legislation. Walker refers to ""$680 over four years.""According to Webster, the ""four years"" was used because the savings reference is not just to the recent legislation, but to four years of reforms and belt-tightening that included freezing or greatly restricting how much school districts and local governments could collect from local taxpayers.With that in mind, we compared the four-year change in the median property tax bill under Walker vs. Doyle.Hard numbers, not a hypothetical.The median bill was $2,963 when Walker came in, and is projected to be $2,954 in year four of his term, based on decisions already made. That’s a drop of $9, the result of three years of annual declines followed by an increase in 2014 that is projected to eat up most of the earlier cuts.By contrast, the four straight annual increases in Doyle’s last four years resulted in a net increase of $230 in the median tax bill.Our ratingWalker said that with a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief, ""the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years.""The claim in an e-newsletter strongly suggests $680 in hard savings from that tax relief bill, or at the very least during Walker’s four years, but we found nothing to back up that number or anything close to it.You can only get to it using a rough hypothetical scenario based on some big assumptions, and can make a case for $239 in four-year savings compared to the four years prior to his term.But Walker’s newsletter doesn’t disclose that his number is hypothetical, misleading the reader into thinking that the median tax bill actually has dropped by $680.We rate his claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Glenn Beck says Barack Obama knew that 50% of Americans would lose health insurance,"The attacks continue against President Barack Obama for saying ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."" Latest up: Conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck, who claims Obama knew what was going to happen all along.""They had the studies that showed that up to 80 million people would lose their health insurance,"" Beck said Monday on his radio show, which is syndicated on more than 400 stations. ""Now we find out this week that number is actually 125 million. Half of the population in the United States, they knew half of the population of the United States would lose their doctor and their health insurance?""And yet he went on the road over and over and over and over and over and over again and said, ‘You'll be able to keep your doctor if you like him, you’ll be able to keep your health insurance,’ when they knew half of the population the United States would lose their health insurance.""Conover, in his work, looks ahead to the end of 2014 and makes a few predictions.""Of the 189 million Americans with private health insurance coverage, I estimate that if Obamacare is fully implemented, at least 129 million (68 percent) will not be able to keep their previous health care plan,"" Conover said.That’s where Beck gets his 125 million figure, which for the record, is about 40 percent of the population of the United States, not 50 percent.Conover continues, ""But of these (129 million), ‘only’ 18 to 50 million will literally lose coverage, i.e., have their plans entirely taken away. ... The rest will retain their old plans but have to pay higher rates for Obamacare-mandated bells and whistles.""Whether you believe Conover or not is irrelevant when considering Beck’s claim. Conover says 18 million to 50 million people will lose coverage -- Beck said 125 million, a gross exaggeration.But that’s only one issue. Conover himself takes issue with Beck’s use of his estimate.""In my view, ‘lose their health insurance’ without any further qualification has a different connotation than ‘not be able to keep their previous health plan’,"" he told PunditFact. ""Absent any further explanation, many might interpret ‘losing’ health coverage as becoming uninsured.""What they did knowSo Beck’s claim is obviously wrong as to the number. But he also indicated Obama knew that millions of people would lose their health insurance.What evidence is there of that?It is not as though the White House was unaware that the Affordable Care Act would change business as usual, in both the individual and group health insurance markets. (The individual market is where people buy insurance on their own; the group market is when an employer does the buying and tells workers what their options are.)But that study did not try to account for a very common situation -- plans that changed, but already met the new health care law’s standards.Beck’s staff offered a narrower view -- that any plan that changes means you have lost your insurance.If so, then many employees have been losing their insurance every year as plans change, premiums increase, or co-pays swing one way or the other.Conover said part of the point of his analysis is that plans will change but coverage would remain. The best way to describe his analysis, he said: ""Half of those with private insurance would be unable to keep their pre-ACA plans.""Other experts PunditFact spoke with agreed that there’s a big difference between losing your health insurance and seeing your plan change.""It does not mean that someone is losing their insurance plan,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""The situation is different in the individual market, where plans (many of which offer limited coverage) are being canceled by insurers. But the individual market only represents about 5 percent of the country.""Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, was equally emphatic.""Losing grandfathered status does not mean that you lose your health insurance,"" Harrington said.Our rulingBeck said that when Obama promised that people could keep the plans they like, he knew that half of all Americans would lose their health insurance. Beck is wrong in every respect. The primary study he relied on contradicts his number, saying that at most 50 million people would lose coverage, not 125 million. Beck’s staff said they believe that any change in a plan means you have lost your health insurance.Not even the author of the study Beck cites agrees with that, nor do the other health policy experts we consulted.  On top of that, the government estimate of the number of plans that would be fully exposed to the new insurance requirements actually says little about the law’s impact. The law’s requirements would only matter for plans that did not measure up; many of them already did.Lastly, there is no evidence that Obama knew or believed that a calamity of this magnitude was in store.The claim needs a checkup. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Barack Obama says that what he'd said was you could keep your plan 'if it hasn’t changed since the law passed',"President Barack Obama’s attempt at explanation has only fanned the flames of controversy over his campaign line, ""If you like your health care, you can keep it.""Obama was already dealing with a troubled rollout of the healthcare.gov website when reports of health insurance cancellation notices for many Americans started arriving.Such notices have been common only for people purchasing insurance on the individual market, which accounts for about 5 percent of Americans, a small minority. But the existence of people in that situation struck many critics as contradicting his like-it, keep-it promise on its face.Obama’s speech on Nov. 4, 2013, at a meeting of Organizing for Action, his campaign organization, seemed to offer a new, and confusing, wrinkle.""Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" Obama said.The way we read that comment -- and, judging by the contentious White House press briefing the following day, the way other Washington journalists read it -- was that Obama was saying that people had been misreporting the pledge he had made.It wasn’t that he said ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" -- it was ""if your plan hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" you can keep it.We wondered whether there was any evidence that Obama had used this particular caveat in the past.Some background on ""grandfathering""First, a brief reminder of why some Americans are getting cancellation notices.Under the new law, policies must cover a comprehensive set of benefits, including emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. If they don’t, they can be ""grandfathered"" in, but only if the plans have not been changed at all.To be grandfathered, the plans must have operated continuously since before the law’s enactment in 2010 and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law’s requirements.That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail.We should note that Obama’s comments often were aimed at the general public. And most people do get to keep their health plans under his law, especially those who get insurance through work or Medicare. His plan specifically left the existing health care system in place while reducing the ranks of the uninsured.Obama’s comments before the law passedObama used the phrase 26 times between his inauguration and when the law passed. Here are four representative samples.We found 10 instances after the law was signed when Obama made the pledge again.Finally, as recently as a few weeks ago, Obama was playing down the impact.Overall, we didn’t find one instance in which Obama offered a caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t changed after the law’s passage.What the White House saysThe day after Obama claimed that he’d said ""you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" reporters grilled White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.Carney claimed Obama was referring to the rules that Sebelius issued in June 2010.""When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it … if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in June of 2010. There was a fair amount of coverage of that in major newspapers.""The White House pointed us to a June 14, 2010, telephone news conference with Sebelius on the rules.""If you have a plan that you like, you keep it, but if indeed insurers or employers decide to make dramatic shifts, to the detriment of employees, huge cost shifts, huge increases in deductibles, slashing benefits, whatever, they then no longer qualify for the grandfather status, because that's really a change in the plan, and that isn't a plan that most people like very much,"" she said.Finally, the White House provided a series of other comments in which the administration offered a more nuanced formulation of the like-it, keep-it policy, but they were all in the past month, during the time when such criticism was already emerging.Our rulingAccording to Obama, ""What we said was you can keep (your plan) if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.""While Sebelius’ teleconference with reporters did provide that sort of caveat, in other instances, such as her blog post, she focused on the upside, not the downside. Her one mention of the extent to which grandfathered plans might be doomed strikes us as the equivalent of the fine print on a television commercial running in heavy rotation. Obama is ignoring the overwhelming majority of times he addressed the issue, where most people would have heard it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chris Abele says Milwaukee is one of few communities that didn’t lose population in last census,"Among the plethora of positive points Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele shared in a recent speech was this one: Milwaukee is on a very short list of areas that didn’t shrink in the last U.S. census.""We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census, the median age for which went down, and any economist will tell you that’s good news.""That is good news.If it’s accurate.To be sure, the city of Milwaukee’s population losses in recent decades have paled in comparison to some other Midwestern cities.But we were surprised by Abele’s broader population claim, which compares us with communities across the nation. Just what numbers was he using?Abele’s office first pointed us to state population trends from 2010 to 2012 showing a gain for Wisconsin. But that didn’t address his claim about Milwaukee and the country. What’s more, Abele’s state data showed that 49 states gained population from 2010 to 2012, based on the most recent estimates.So, virtually no one went down.There’s another problem: The figures he shared with us were based on annual population estimates by the Census Bureau, not the full census -- the nose count that occurs every 10 years, most recently in April 2010.Abele’s ""last census"" reference may have been to the estimates, not the actual census. But as we’ll see it doesn’t change the accuracy of his claim.Let’s look at the population numbers, starting with the last full census.Milwaukee’s population changeFirst, we checked population figures for the city, for Milwaukee County and for the Milwaukee metro area, comparing the 2000 census with the 2010 census.The national pictureThen we examined census data on other large urban areas, again noting the change in population in the decade.It’s clear from the data that most urban areas grew or at least held steady, contrary to Abele’s claim.And the modest growth in the Milwaukee metro region, though rivaling the Los Angeles and New York City areas, was at the very low end among large urban areas.""Population growth of at least twice the national rate occurred in many metro and micro areas, such as some areas in parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. No metro area in the West region declined,"" the 2010 Census report said.Among counties, the report said, ""the counties that lost population were mostly regionally clustered and mirrored decades of population loss for those areas.""For example, there were population declines in many Appalachian counties in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia; many Great Plains counties in the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas; and a group of counties in and around the Mississippi Delta.Notably, the report found that ""many counties along the Great Lakes and on the northern U.S. border either lost population or grew below 10 percent.""After we completed our fact check, Abele’s office got back to us again.This time, we were told Abele had been referring specifically to the city of Milwaukee, and the small estimated gain it made between the 2010 census and 2012.It’s true that annual census estimates since the full 2010 census show the city of Milwaukee growing slightly, by about 2,000 people.In 2011, for example, the Census Bureau noted that ""overall, the population in cities grew by 1.0 percent across the nation between 2010 and 2011. However, large cities (285) tended to grow faster than the national rate at 1.3 percent.""Abele spokesman Brendan Conway conceded his boss would have been more accurate had he referred specifically to the Great Lakes Area cities and population growth.Our ratingAbele contended that ""We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census.""However you cut it, he’s way off base. This claim, given that fast growth in certain regions of the U.S. is well-established and well-known, ventures into ridiculous territory.Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,No evidence for claim that Texas voter ID law tries to disenfranchise women and defeat Wendy Davis,"An Oct. 24, 2013, email blast from the Democratic Governors Association opened: ""BREAKING: Texas Governor Rick Perry’s voter ID law is a blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters.""The email, urging donations to Davis’ gubernatorial campaign, went on to say that Perry and ""his handpicked successor, Greg Abbott,"" the Republican Texas attorney general running for governor, ""are trying to undo the voting rights women fought for – a century ago! It’s downright anti-democratic.""Dramatic--and is this so?To our request for backup information, an association spokesman, Danny Kanner, emailed us links to a news article and commentary, both published in October 2013, and to a 2006 report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. The articles touched on the possibility that photo IDs presented by women at the polls might not have the same names on them as voter records. None reached conclusions about a link between the 2011 law and Davis garnering votes for governor in 2014.Under the Texas law, which had its implementation delayed to the November 2013 elections by legal challenges, voters going to the polls are expected to present a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or by the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate).One voter's experienceThe story further noted that the alternative to signing a voter affidavit would be to vote a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot isn’t counted until seven to 10 days after an election and then only after a voter proves their eligibility.Commentator's speculationBrennan Center surveyConcern about women being blocked from voting is one thing. We looked for signs the law was written to do so, coming up empty.A press release and a news blog postOn the Nexis database, we searched for news articles on the 2011 Texas law and the disenfranchisement of women.Many stories touched on Democratic charges that ID demands at the polls would deter Latino and black voters. Very little turned up focusing on the effects of the mandate on women.""Long before she was a Harvard-educated attorney and a member of the state Senate, Wendy Davis was a divorced single mom who was holding down two jobs and raising a young daughter while attending Tarrant County Community College,"" the newspaper’s Dave Montgomery said in a Jan. 25, 2011, PoliTex blog post. ""Davis recalled those experiences Tuesday as the Republican-controlled state Senate debated a controversial voter ID bill. Like other Democrats, she contended that (Senate Bill) 14 threatens to disenfranchise the indigent, minorities and elderly by requiring voters to show a photo identification in order to vote,"" the post went.The blog post continued: ""‘There was a time when I was indigent,’ the Fort Worth lawmaker told Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, as they debated the merits of the legislation. Had the law been in effect during her earlier days, Davis told Fraser, she ‘would have been quite challenged’ in acquiring the documentation needed to exercise her right to vote.""Davis cited her own experiences when was holding down two jobs and said that many low-income Texans do not have the time to leave work and stand in long lines, nor do they have the money to purchase the required ID documents, Montgomery wrote. ""For people who have to take off at work it can be a very real problem,"" Davis said as she stood beside a chart illustrating the cost of supporting documents, the blog post said. ""I'm afraid we're going to wind up disenfranchising legal citizens...who are going to be denied the right to vote.""More women might lack required ID to voteSeparately, we asked activists and attorneys who have questioned the law about evidence bearing on the association’s claim.Wendy Weiser, who directs a Brennan Center project focused on voting rights and who also has been involved in litigation against the law, said by telephone that she is not aware of studies specific to the ID mandate’s effect on women alone, though she said that due to marriages and divorces, women generally change their names more often than men.But the state of Texas and federal judges have objected to reaching conclusions about how many people carry appropriate IDs based on such absences of matching information, a spokesman for Abbott’s state office, Jerry Strickland, pointed out by email.Regardless, the 2012 ruling said the state had failed to prove the ID law would not lead to retrogression in voting among racial minorities. That ruling also challenged the methodology behind tabulating those registration records lacking driver license numbers. The judges noted, first, that Texans seeking to register to vote are given the option of recording the last four digits of a Social Security number or their eight-digit driver’s license number, meaning ""even voters who possess a driver’s license may opt to provide a Social Security number. After all, four digits are easier to write than eight. Furthermore, many voters likely memorize their Social Security number but not their driver’s license number,"" the judges wrote. ""Thus, what voters write on their registration form is barely probative of whether they actually possess a state-issued ID card—much less whether they possess any"" of the types of photo IDs permitted under the law.State: No voters turned away to dateFinally, a spokeswoman for the Texas Secretary of State’s office, Alicia Pierce, telephoned us after learning of this fact check from the attorney general’s office. Pierce stressed that the Texas law does not require anyone’s name on a valid ID to perfectly match their name on their voter registration. She said, too, that voters whose names are ""substantially"" similar had cast ballots in the 2013 ""early voting"" period by swearing that they are who they say they are. Men and women were affected to limited degrees, she said. She said she was not aware of anyone with a substantially similar name on their ID and voter registration being prevented from voting.Our rulingThe Democratic governors group said the voter ID measure signed into law by Perry is a ""blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters.""In addition to its timeline gulf--the ID proposal passed into law two years before Davis emerged as a serious gubernatorial prospect--this claim suffers from an absence of proof that the Texas law was intended to disenfranchise tens of thousands of women or has had such an immediate effect.Significantly, we are not judging here whether the ID hurdle is affecting voter participation. The law is lately being enforced for the first time. Only after the 2013 elections is there likely to be data on its effect on voters--of all kinds.This pre-election claim, weakened by chronological illogic and an overall absence of evidence, shakes out as both incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says 'it's illegal' for her to use the health insurance exchange,"Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before Congress Oct. 30 for the first time since the federal health care marketplaces went online, answering questions about problems with the website and facing accusations that President Barack Obama lied to the American people about who could keep their health care plan.At the tail end of three and a half hours of testimony, Sebelius had a testy exchange with Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who asked the secretary why she wasn’t enrolling in the exchanges herself.""If I have affordable coverage in my workplace, I'm not eligible to go into the marketplace. ... It’s illegal,"" she said.The Twittersphere lit up after Sebelius’ remarks, questioning whether they were valid. Even the government’s own website instructs people with job-based insurance that ""if you'd like to explore marketplace coverage options you can.""So was Sebelius right and the Obamacare website wrong, or vice versa? Given the vast amount of misinformation circulating around the health care law and the insurance marketplaces, we thought it necessary to straighten this out.Employer insurance vs. MedicareWe went right to the source on this one, asking the Department of Health and Human Services if Sebelius misspoke. It turns out she did.Individuals who have health insurance through their employer can sign up for the online marketplaces, it’s just not financially beneficial for most to do so. If an individual forgoes affordable insurance through work, he or she won’t qualify for subsidies to help pay for insurance on the government-run marketplaces. And plans purchased through an employer are typically cheaper because the company is paying a portion of the costs.A spokeswoman for the department said Sebelius meant to say, ""Marketplace plans cannot be sold to a Medicare enrollee, and the secretary is a Medicare enrollee.""That hasn’t always been clear, said David Lipschutz, a policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Nothing in the Affordable Care Act mentions whether Medicare enrollees are eligible for the health insurance marketplaces, he said, but the administration lately has cited a section of the Social Security Act also known as the Medicare Anti-Duplication provision that bars private insurance companies from offering coverage to Medicare enrollees.There are some exceptions. A small fraction of individuals who are not eligible for free Medicare Part A and those with end stage renal disease can still buy insurance on the exchanges and receive federal subsidies. Neither of those situations apply to Sebelius.Hypothetically, Sebelius could abandon her government health care plan and get out of Medicare Part A. But that would require her to revoke and forfeit her Social Security benefits for the rest of her life, something we can’t envision anyone volunteering to do.""It’s really not going to be an option to drop it in order to get into an exchange,"" said Andrea Callow, also a policy attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy.Our rulingIt’s pretty clear Sebelius was wrong when she said ""it’s illegal"" for her to buy insurance on the exchange because she already has affordable insurance through her employer. Those inclined to do so certainly can, though the financial incentives to stay with the employer-based plan are quite convincing.We rate her statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Rhode Island Tea Party says soldiers who donate to the tea party face military discipline,"""Soldiers Donating to Tea Party Now Face Punishment Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.""The story says that two anonymous soldiers said they were told during a pre-deployment briefing at Fort Hood in Texas that evangelical Christians and members of the tea party were threats to the nation, so any soldier donating to them would be subject to punishment.But the story also quotes a Fort Hood spokesman as saying that, based on a preliminary investigation, the claim reported by Red Flag News ""is not substantiated by unit leadership and soldiers present at this training venue.""Service members are allowed to donate to campaigns and political parties as private individuals, subject to the same laws that apply to all federal employees.When we asked the Department of Defense about the tea party tweet and the Red Flag headline, spokesman Lt. Col. J. Todd Breasseale, called it ""an absurdity of such outlandish proportion, it's almost difficult to take seriously.""But it's also a kind of un-American, potentially dangerous fear-mongering,"" he said, ""and so I'd like to be as clear as I can here: Service members may donate to any legal cause they choose, and, as long as they do so within the boundaries of the Hatch Act, may involve themselves (out of uniform, without using government equipment, off duty, in a way that implies no government endorsement) in the political process, regardless of party affiliation.""When we contacted the Rhode Island Tea Party to ask about the Twitter message, President Susan Wynne said in a email, ""I was merely sharing the story and is not an endorsement by RI Tea Party. If you find any other information, I'd be happy to see it."" If the tweet was wrong, she said in a subsequent email, it would be deleted. We sent her a copy of Breasseale's statement. Four days later, the tweet was still there.At PolitiFact, we believe people and parties have an obligation to check things out before they blindly pass them along to others.It's true that Red Flag News (motto: ""Aggregating the News that Mainstream Media Distort and Ignore"") originated the over-the-top headline. But Wynne, on behalf of her organization, chose to repeat it, even when the story itself included facts that should have prompted some skepticism."
PANTS-FIRE,"Wisconsin sold fresh water to California, potential Democratic congressional candidate says","When Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy.""I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we’re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we’ve had in place for now, well over two decades,"" he said.""I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we’re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America's Dairyland. Now, California is called America's Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn't get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland.""But we’ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process.Wouldn’t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened?Big ideasTo be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places.In 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later.So, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact?""No way. It's really simple,"" Eder said of Kaleka’s claim. ""He’s wrong. I don’t know where he’s getting his information, but it’s not based in fact.""And if it never occurred, it certainly didn’t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here.Kaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say ""we thought about sending them fresh water.""He added: ""I'm going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics.""But on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California.And we could find no record of it.Our ratingKaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and ""lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland.""There’s no evidence of such a water sale, something that would have made for countless front-page stories, let alone it leading to a loss of jobs and farmland in Wisconsin.The statement is false and ridiculous: Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,No basis to NextGen claim Cuccinelli wants to ban all contraception,"As the campaign reaches its final stretch, Democrats and their allies continue to accuse Ken Cuccinelli of holding extreme views on everything from climate change to birth control.NextGen Climate Action Committee, a Democratic-aligned super pac, has fired out a series of mailers during the last two weeks accusing Cuccinelli, among other things, of ""wanting to eliminate all forms of birth control.""The editorial said the failed legislation would have ""provided an opening to prohibit common methods of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices.""Debate over the impact of legislation that confers personhood from the moment of conception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that devices that merely prevent fertilization wouldn’t be affected by personhood laws.The issue is that some forms -- including the intrauterine device, emergency contraception and birth control pills -- may also work by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Some people say those methods go beyond mere contraception and are tantamount to causing an abortion.The group wrote, ""some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,, and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt ‘personhood’ measures.""Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he would not seek to restrict contraception. We asked his campaign how he defines birth control but did not receive a clear response. As a state senator in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a bill that would have specified that contraception that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg is not an abortion.Our rulingNextGen Climate Action Committee says Cuccinelli wants to ""eliminate all forms of birth control.""The group cites an editorial that said personhood legislation Cuccinelli supported could have fostered legal challenges to types of contraception that prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. But the editorial made no assertion Cuccinelli wants to ban all birth control devices.Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he has no interest in restricting contraception, which generally works by preventing ovulation or the fertilization of a human egg.NextGen doesn’t have a speck of proof to bolster its incendiary claim that Cuccinelli wants to ban all forms of birth control -- even condoms and spermicides.

PANTS-FIRE,Maine Gov. Paul LePage says 47 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aren't working,"Recently, LePage made another comment that has attracted national attention.""Informed that the event was wrapping up, LePage said he had two more points to make. The first was just one word: ‘energy.’ The second was, he said, in reference to ‘workforce development.’""‘About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work,’ said LePage.""On the recording you can hear a member of the audience ask, ‘What?’ LePage repeats himself. ‘About 47 percent. It’s really bad.’""The blog post inspired a flurry of media attention, in part because LePage’s comment echoed the one from the 2012 presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney said that 47 percent of the American people are ""dependent upon government."" Romney’s comment was widely considered a blunder that hampered his bid for the White House.This number would suggest that LePage is in the ballpark. But calling this a ""rough"" calculation is too kind. It’s actually a silly way of calculating it.First, doing it this way suggests that everybody -- no matter how old or young -- should be working. The numbers change dramatically if you exclude Maine residents up to age 18 and over 65 from the statistics.In 2012, Maine’s 18-to-64 population was 836,898. Using this as the denominator means that about 21 percent of Maine residents were not working.If you subtract this group, then there were 735,898 ""able-bodied people"" age 18 to 64 in Maine, and only 10 percent of them were not working.Finally, in August 2013, there were 49,966 unemployed people in Maine. These are people who have looked for work recently but have not found it. If you add these to the number of employed Maine residents, then just 3.6 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 are neither working nor actively looking for employment.That’s far off from the 47 percent LePage claimed.It’s possible to quibble about the specifications we’ve used, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. For instance, you could get a bit closer to LePage’s 47 percent figure if you counted 16- and 17-year olds or people up to age 74, who have been working in growing numbers in recent years.Still, Burtless said, ""even if you tried to include all the ‘able-bodied’ Maine residents past 65 in your calculations, I'm pretty confident you'd find Gov. LePage's claim to be ridiculous.""Our rulingLePage said that ""about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work."" Unless LePage thinks newborns and nonagenarians ought to get off their tushes and find a job, this is a ridiculous claim.In reality, only about 10 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 aren’t employed. And if you include those who are actively looking for work but who can’t find a job in today’s poor economy, the figure drops as low as 3.6 percent. We rate LePage’s claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Common Core opponents say its goal is for the federal government to instill religious and political beliefs,"If reading about how Common Core aims to establish the same standards across states in reading and math makes you yawn, consider some of the more controversial subjects in which the feds want to tell your children what to think, say Common Core opponents.Here, we will fact-check whether Common Core includes the federal government dictating what students should think about politics and religion.Report that makes claims about Common CoreFlorida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks  -- though local school districts can still choose to do so.All curriculum decisions are made locally by schools boards, schools and teachers, according to the state Department of Education.We read nothing in the standards that suggested that any level of government was telling students what political or religious beliefs they should personally hold.So what evidence do the critics have for saying the Common Core will instill political and religious beliefs?The list shown includes ""voting status"" and ""religious consideration"" and ""religious affiliation."" (It also includes far more mundane elements such as a student’s birthdate, address and race.) These are elements that districts could choose to collect on any individual in the district: students, parents or teachers.We could not find the same list of attributes on the NEDM website, but we shared it with officials involved with NEDM and they didn’t dispute it.But there are some major caveats about this list of data elements. First, this is not a required list of data for all states or school districts to collect. Instead, it is a voluntary model that states can use to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. That means states or districts could choose to use some of the data elements and not others, or ignore the data model entirely.Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said.Buckley said that federal officials did not come up with these potential elements out of thin air -- they were chosen because certain school districts or states had sought that particular data element in the past.""Remember this is all voluntary,"" Buckley said. ""If your state already collects this, or has a reason why it collects it, (then we tell them) ‘here is how we recommend you code it’ so everyone doesn’t invent their own code for religions.’""We interviewed Alexander Jackl, chief architect Choice Solutions, Inc., an education data software company and one of the original authors of the National Education Data Model. Jackl is also a member of a working group about the newer version -- the Common Education Data Standards, or CEDS.The data fields for religion in particular are useful for private, religious schools, he said.Those fields ""are in the NEDM conceptual model as possible attributes,"" Jackl told PolitiFact in an email. ""This makes sense as parochial schools and religious universities might make use of NEDM as well and those elements would be useful for them. It looks, though, like they were not carried forward into CEDS.""We contacted a few school districts in Florida to ask if they collect data on voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliations, or if they plan to start doing that with Common Core.Here’s the response we received from a spokesman for Miami-Dade schools: ""No. No. No. And no."" Broward, Hillsborough and Pasco schools also don’t collect that data.""I can’t think of any useful or legitimate educational reason to know that information,"" said Linda Cobbe, Pasco schools spokeswoman.The Florida Department of Education does not require school districts to ask about voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliation and has no plan to do so under Common Core, department spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said.Fears have become widespreadIn Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order in May to prohibit the state from collecting certain information about students and their families, including religious and political affiliation and voting history. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Michigan house.In response to questions from parents, the Arizona state superintendent of public instruction distributed a fact-sheet that states: ""Will the system track a family's political affiliations or firearms ownership? Absolutely not.""Also, there is a clear difference between a state or a school district choosing to ask students about their voting status or religious affiliation and, as the report suggests, and using Common Core as a way to ""instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs.""But nothing we saw in Effrem’s email proved that as a result of Common Core the federal government is trying to instill particular religious or political beliefs in students.Additionally, we found nothing in either of the data models to suggest that the federal government is telling students what political or religious beliefs they should hold. For public schools, it wouldn’t be constitutional, anyway.Our rulingThe goal of Common Core ""is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs,"" said an anti-Common Core group.Their evidence, though, is flimsy at best: A computer model that has a data field for voting status or religion, which would typically be used by a private school.

PANTS-FIRE,Ann Coulter says no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare,"Conservative commentator Ann Coulter is not known for mincing words, but a recent column prompted many PolitiFact readers to contact us, seeking a fact-check.We were most intrigued by one claim, since we hadn’t heard it before -- that ""no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.""Really?We tried to ask Coulter through her speaker’s bureau if she could provide any evidence for this, but we did not receive a reply. We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law.So let’s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting ""Obamacare"" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law?In fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as ""outrageous,"" ""ridiculous"" and ""ludicrous.""""Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,"" said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health.So, no dice on the literal reading of her claim.Still, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance?The survey asked, among other things, ""Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?"" Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive ""yes."" That rate is twice as high as the share that that said ""no"" (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent).The top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles.However, it’s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter’s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors.In fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter’s claim becomes.But tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won’t be changed by Obama’s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas.With such high barriers to entry, it’s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces.""I haven't seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured,"" Baicker said.And even if there were such evidence, ""disproportionate is a far cry from ‘none,’ "" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd.""Our rulingCoulter said that ""no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."" Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It’s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia -- that merits a Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Dewhurst, suggesting Obama's impeachment, airs ridiculous claim about White House fielding live video of Benghazi attacks as they occurred","Dewhurst, the third-term lieutenant governor faced with three challengers for the 2014 Republican nomination, suggested Obama’s impeachment while speaking Oct. 14, 2013, to the Northeast Tarrant County Tea Party, which also heard from the other GOP candidates.""This election is about protecting you and your freedoms, which are given to you by God, but which are being trampled on by Barack Obama right now. I don’t know about you, but Barack Obama ought to be impeached,"" Dewhurst said, according to the Observer. ""Not only for trampling on our liberties, but what he did in Benghazi is just a crime.""Afterward, Dewhurst elaborated on his criticism of the administration’s handling of the September 2012 attack in Benghazi, which killed Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stephens. ""I’m very concerned about Benghazi, in which all of the national news reporting indicated that live video was streaming into the White House,"" Dewhurst told Observer reporter Christopher Hooks. ""That means that there was an overhead platform, probably a drone in the area. At least that’s what it tells me,"" he said. ""And for not mobilizing some response to protect the ambassador and those three Americans is just outrageous to me. Just outrageous.""We asked Dewhurst for the basis of his reference to a live video feed of the attacks reaching the White House and didn’t hear back.It didn’t take us long to find that the ""Benghazi live stream"" claim has already been debunked by the Snopes.com ""urban legends"" website.The Forbes article did not provide a source for writer Larry Bell’s reference to real-time video.""The Obama administration has been studying the videos, taken from closed-circuit cameras throughout the Benghazi consulate’s four-building compound, for clues about who was responsible for the attack and how it played out,"" the story said.The story did not mention any live stream into the White House, though it said that in ""addition to the footage from the consulate cameras, the U.S. government is also poring over video taken from an overhead U.S. surveillance drone that arrived for the final hour of the night battle at the consulate compound and nearby annex.""Our rulingDewhurst said live video of the Benghazi attacks reached the White House as the attacks occurred.That’s not confirmed by news reports we found, while the White House said in October 2012 that no one there watched a live video feed.Given that this claim has been debunked for about a year, we see it as incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Bill Foster's 'Rick Scott-inspired fire fee'? Here's the real story,"To political operatives, campaign mailers are often considered the most effective way to target voters, particularly in local elections.To fact-checkers, they’re often home to glaring distortions.Today’s example: A flier in the St. Petersburg mayor race that links incumbent Bill Foster, a $10 million fire fee and Republican Gov. Rick Scott.A headline on the mailer reads, ""Bill Foster's $10 million Rick Scott-inspired fire fee.""""Foster’s $10 million fire fee would have charged you for services you already pay for. Sound familiar?"" the text continues. ""Instead of taking leadership by cutting fluff out of the budget, Bill Foster took a page out of Rick Scott’s Tallahassee playbook and tried to charge us millions of dollars in ‘fees’ that taxed you for services the government should have already been providing -- $10 million of them!""The flier comes from Fact Check Florida, an electioneering communication organization, or ECO, that supports liberal candidates and is run by Jacksonville resident Matthew Martz. As an ECO, Fact Check Florida (nice name, by the way) can pay for ads that attack candidates, but it cannot expressly advocate for a candidate’s defeat or election. It can tell you why it thinks Foster is a bad guy but can’t tell you to vote for Foster’s opponent, Rick Kriseman.About the fire feeYes, Foster pitched a fire readiness assessment, or ""fire fee"" in 2012 as a way to plug the city’s budget gap after another year of disappearing property tax revenues.But the idea was not ""inspired"" by Scott in any way.""It was funny because it was from Fact Check Florida,"" Foster told us, ""and there was nothing factual about it.""In Foster’s first two years in office, the city made up for lost property tax revenues (a result of declining home values) by reducing positions and program spending. Foster criticized a potential fire fee as a ""backdoor tax increase"" in those years. But in 2012, he suggested that instead of more cuts, the City Council approve a new fire readiness fee that would total $9 million a year, which was about the amount needed to close its gap for 2013.The connection to ScottFact Check Florida's Martz defended the mailer. While the fee was ""obviously"" not Scott’s idea, he said, it’s similar to Tallahassee Republicans who ""keep coming up with tiny ways to take money out of voters’ pockets without them noticing.""""Under Rick Scott, it was with tuition rates,"" he said. ""And before he got there, the Republicans did it with driver’s license renewals and things.""Martz’s last point refers to $2.2 billion in increased taxes and fees that Republican lawmakers passed in 2009 -- before Scott became governor.The evolution was inevitable after the city voted in 1993 to move to a strong mayor system, argues Darryl Paulson, University of South Florida St. Petersburg professor emeritus of government. In the case of this ad, tying Foster with an unpopular governor appeals to the emotions of voters, Paulson said.""The Democrats are in essence trying to say that even though it’s not a partisan race, look who is supporting Foster, and we as Democrats hate the governor,"" Paulson said. ""It’s really designed as a get out the vote effort to get Democratic voters to to vote in a nonpartisan election.""Our rulingA mailpiece attempts to connect Foster’s rejected proposal for a fire readiness fee with Scott.

PANTS-FIRE,A closer look at a Facebook post on a man's struggle with the Obamacare marketplace,"But for our readers, one post stood out.The Facebook post claims to be from a man named Will Sheehan. (We couldn’t confirm his identity.)  The post says that he tried to sign up for Obamacare and then decided to not go along with it; he then said he received an email detailing fines he would face.  Here’s the full text of the post:""I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 ‘Silver Plan’ and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I ‘opt-out’ and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the ‘REPERCUSSIONS PORTION’ for ‘non-payment’ of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with ‘Non-Payment’ and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy ‘Automatically withdraw’ your ‘penalties’ weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is ‘Free’ or even ‘Affordable’.""We will check a number of the post’s claims below.According to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the marketplace, this is not how the system works: ""There's no way for people to complete the online application and then affirmatively ‘opt out’ at the end. They would simply close the website or not enroll in a plan.""This is wrong on several levels. First, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Second, any fines would be calculated as part of the user’s overall income tax form 1040 -- they wouldn’t be sent as a bill. And third, any taxes would be owed by April 15, 2015 -- a year and a half from now. Someone being assessed a tax penalty by the Internal Revenue Service in early October doesn’t even make any sense, since the applicant has many weeks to find another insurance plan and avoid a penalty.If we are to take this Facebook user’s claims at face value -- that his ""income base was 45K-55K annually""-- and if he has no dependents, he would not have to pay any more than $550, by 2015. To pay a penalty of $4,037 in 2014, you would need to be making making more than $403,700 a year.CMS told PolitiFact that nobody’s driver's license will be suspended as a noncompliance penalty under the Affordable Care Act. Nothing in the law mentions that as a penalty, and driver’s licenses are administered by state governments.A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the law specifically bars the IRS from using their normal means of collecting unpaid taxes, including the use of liens and levy.  Instead, the only thing the IRS can do to collect fines is to subtract it from any tax refund you qualify for. If you aren’t due a refund, all the IRS can do is send you a letter.Don’t take online banking advice from a Facebook post. The Treasury Department warns citizens not to hand out bank information online.Our rulingThe Facebook post tells the story of a man who says he opted out of Obamacare soon after the marketplace was launched on Oct. 1, 2013, and was informed that he owed a fine of more than $4,000.The post includes many elements that make no sense or are flat-out wrong -- and can be easily debunked by reading the law or reliable summaries of it.

PANTS-FIRE,"McAuliffe says Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" Va. government ","Which gubernatorial candidate is most likely to shut down Virginia’s government?Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe pointed fingers at each other during a Sept. 25 debate.Cuccinelli noted that McAuliffe has repeatedly said that, if elected, he would not a sign a budget that failed to expand the state’s Medicaid program as allowed under Obamacare. Cuccinelli said McAuliffe’s vow is tantamount threatening a state government shutdown -- a statement we’ll look at in the coming days.McAuliffe threw the dart back at Cuccinelli.""The only one on this stage that almost had (a shut down) effected was Ken Cuccinelli, when he almost derailed the Virginia budget when he was trying to defund Planned Parenthood,"" McAuliffe said. ""So he’s the only one on the stage that actually tried to shut down our government.""When asked for more information, McAuliffe’s campaign said Cuccinelli tried to padlock state government on Feb. 27, 2008. The General Assembly, deliberating a two-year state budget to go into effect at midyear, faced a procedural deadline that day. The House and the Senate were scheduled to advance competing versions of the budget, which would be ironed out in the coming days by negotiators from each chamber.Cuccinelli, then a state senator, threw a crimp into the proceedings by offering an amendment that would have stripped Planned Parenthood of all state funding -- roughly $250,000 at the time.  Democrats, who held a 21-19 majority in the Senate, traditionally had been supportive of Planned Parenthood, while Republicans had been critical of the women’s health group, which provides abortion services. But one of the Democrats -- Sen. Charles Colgan of Prince William County -- was firmly opposed to abortions and planned to vote for Cuccinelli’s amendment. And there was no doubt that Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, would cast a tie-breaking vote to defund Planned Parenthood.Democrats spent much of the afternoon in caucus trying to pressure Colgan to change his vote. They failed, and Bolling pushed the amendment through. Cuccinelli’s victory was short-lived, however. The Planned Parenthood amendment was not part of the final budget approved by the General Assembly two weeks later.McAuliffe’s campaign says an Associated Press story from that day justifies the claim that Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" state government through his amendment. The article said the budget ""was almost killed Wednesday in a partisan Senate duel."" The story added, however, that the amendment was one of several issues that strained relations that day and kept the Senate in session almost eight hours before it narrowly approved its version of the budget. Even if the Senate had failed to pass its spending plan, the article noted, the state’s complicated budget process would have remained alive.McAuliffe’s campaign also backed the statement by pointing to a 2008 blog from the conservative Family Foundation that said Cuccinelli’s amendment ""shut down the Senate for over four hours while Republicans and Democrats fought within their own caucuses.""It should be noted that none of the news stories written that day characterized Cuccinelli’s amendment as an attempt to shut down state government or quoted him making such a claim.The General Assembly that year passed a $77 billion biennial budget on March 13. That was five days past its original deadline, which is not an unusual delay. Then-Gov. Tim Kaine signed the budget on May 9 -- 52 days before it went into effect.Our rulingMcAuliffe said Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" state government in order to defund Planned Parenthood.Cuccinelli in 2008 offered a budget amendment that would have ended funding for Planned Parenthood, and debate over the measure tied up the Senate for about four hours. McAuliffe offers no credible evidence that Cuccinelli’s intent was to force state government to close. The Senate, later that same day, approved a budget bill. The final version of the state budget was signed by the governor more than seven weeks before it took effect.McAuliffe has invented a crisis to blame on Cuccinelli.

PANTS-FIRE,"GOP Rep. Jeb Hensarling assails ""sweetheart"" deal for lawmakers, staff under Obamacare","In the wee hours of the morning of Oct. 1, 2013, as the House was engaged in a futile ping-pong match over averting the federal government shutdown, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, took to the floor to decry a ""sweetheart deal"" on health insurance for members of Congress.""Mr. Speaker,"" Hensarling said, ""we are debating should members of Congress get a better deal than every other American in Obamacare? House Republicans say, ‘No, that’s not fair. That’s not equal protection under the law.’ Yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle (Democrats) are now saying, ‘No, no, no.’ They’re going to protect this sweetheart deal. ...""Now members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. Is this fair, Mr. Speaker? I think not. Clearly, the other side of the aisle wants to preserve this special deal for Members of Congress granted by the President of the United States.""Hensarling was referring to a provision of President Barack Obama’s health care law that was originally intended as a political maneuver by critics of the law. We asked his office for evidence to support his statement, but we didn't hear back.Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law.Without a fix, congressional employees would have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. To fix this problem, the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources office, issued a ruling that allowed the same money that would have been spent on the employer’s old health insurance to instead be spent on whatever they purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces.So that’s the background. Getting back to Hensarling’s statement, we see four claims embedded in  it:By contrast, the law revokes the longstanding congressional health insurance arrangement and forces them into a new system, something not done for any other class of employee.In short, the ability for congressional employees to keep their employer cost-share merely returns them to the already harsh provision that severs them from their existing health care plan. All the fix does is stop that provision from making even more trouble by forcing them to pay thousands of dollars more. We don’t think this qualifies as a ""sweetheart deal.""Still, this controversy has been kept alive largely by Republicans, from the original Republican proposal to the Vitter amendment. So it’s at best a stretch to blame Obama.Our rulingHensarling said that in a ""sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges.""That’s a lot to get wrong in the space of a sentence or two.

PANTS-FIRE,Rep. Graves wrong about Buffett's health law stance,"As the nation winds down to a government shutdown and possible default on its debt, the fight over President Barack Obama’s health care law continues.In response to a question about a Wall Street Journal editorial regarding the GOPs inept strategizing on budget issues, Graves said:""That’s their opinion. An editorial clearly is what that is. But when you read the Chicago Tribune, they say delay and stop Obamacare,"" Graves said. ""Warren Buffett says stop it now, start over. … It’s not just Republicans, this is widespread.""Graves’ comments about Buffett were familiar to us and to our audience, which asked us to review the claim. Did Warren Buffett, one of Obama’s early presidential backers, withdraw support for the president’s signature public policy legacy?We asked Graves’ office about his ABC News statements.The office noted that the Money Morning claim, along with follow-up stories by other media outlets, included inaccurate timeline context with their Buffett claim. But outside of the faulty time element, Buffett did say he would stop Obamacare, start over and explain how to do that, Graves’ office said. And, because Graves did not attribute an inaccurate time frame to Buffett’s comments, they believe his statement was true, the office said.But what exactly did Buffett say about Obamacare, when did he say it and what are his current thoughts on the matter?What the blog posts and Graves did not include in their comments was the full context of Buffett’s statements. At the time, Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., was referring to a pending health care bill. (The Affordable Care Act was signed into law days later on March 23, 2010.)Buffett went on to say that he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate version of the bill, but that he’d vote for it instead of doing nothing. Ultimately, Buffett said he’d like to see a plan that really attacked (health care) costs.""I’ve never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped,"" Buffett said in an interview with the Omaha World-Herald. ""I support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That’s something I’ve thought should be done for a long, long time.""Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, told us in an email that Buffett’s office set the record straight for any news organization that contacted them. She also mentioned her boss’s explanation during a CNBC news interview last week.So what about Graves’ claim?The Georgia congressman stated that Warren Buffett said stop Obamacare now and start over. The claim was similar to other blogger claims debunked by fact checkers, and based on an interview Buffett gave three years ago before Obamacare was signed into law. Buffett did say he would scrap the then Senate bill, but also noted that he would vote for it instead of continuing with the existing health care situation.Graves’ claim may not have misrepresented Buffett’s comments as being recent like the bloggers did, but his comments were made after similar claims about Buffett were found to be misleading. And Graves still made the claim, without any additional context, five days after several fact checkers debunked the claim.We rate Graves’ statement Pants on Fire."

And you can thank the Obama health law.""McCaughey then claims that the law offers incentive payments, and eventually penalties, to pressure doctors and hospitals to convert to electronic health records. She quotes a cardiologist saying sex questions are ""insensitive, stupid and very intrusive"" and a nephrologist declaring that new requirements turn your medical record ""into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential.""Readers sent us the op-ed and asked us to fact-check it. So does Obamacare require your dermatologist to ask you about your sex life?‘Sex questions’We talked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two members of a federal committee on health information technology, and the president of a national physicians group.We reached out to McCaughey and the two doctors she quoted, but we didn’t hear back.Here’s what we learned.In other words, McCaughey’s claim was utterly at odds with the evidence.""Arrgghhh — now I have heard it all!"" said Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians.Cooke, an internist, told PolitiFact that when she was in medical school in the 1970s, she was taught to ask:• Are you sexually active (with other people)?• If yes, are your partners men, women or both?• If no, is that out of choice, because you don’t currently have an appealing partner, because you have no privacy, or some other reason?• Are you happy with your sex life, however it is?""My classmates and I were taught to ask all patients all four questions,"" she said. ""I am not saying that we always did it, but these questions are as old as the hills.""The rationale is that patients’ answers may reveal important information about their health, safety and well-being, she said. Her medical practice happens to focus on patients with HIV and other complex chronic illnesses.But let’s say some doctors, such as the cardiologist quoted by McCaughey, find such questions ""insensitive, stupid and very intrusive.""McCaughey wrote that the president’s ""reforms"" aim to ""turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary.""Yet that cardiologist could earn government incentives for meaningful use of electronic health records whether he asked ""sex questions"" or not.‘Electronic health records’We looked at the specifications ourselves.They need to check for drug interactions, keep an up-to-date list of diagnoses, transmit prescriptions, keep medication and allergy lists, and record demographics and vital signs. They need to note preferred language, gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth, height, weight, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status.The demographic information helps doctors catch disparities in care, said Paul Tang, an internist who chairs the workgroup on ""meaningful use"" for the health information technology committee created by the Recovery Act.There’s a requirement to protect electronic health information. But there aren’t any requirements to ask questions about sexual history.That’s not to say they won’t be common: past medical history, family history and social history are fairly standard questions, and it would make sense for vendors of electronic health records systems to include them in their software.But if McCaughey’s cardiologist didn’t want to ask, he could still collect government money for using the records.But the federal push toward electronic health records doesn’t require your doctor to grill you about your sex life.Our rulingMcCaughey says in ""Obamacare will question your sex life"" that you can thank the president’s health law for questions about your sexual activity, even if your doctor finds them unnecessary.She suggests it’s part of Obamacare’s move toward electronic health records. But incentives for electronic health records were part of the Recovery Act, not Obamacare. And they don’t require participating doctors to ask questions about your sex life.McCaughey frames her concern for patient privacy with an evidence-free attack on Obamacare that veers toward the ridiculous.

Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense,"" he said.We should also point out that support from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was particularly strong.Our rulingWhen Blitzer asked about Obama's decision to strike Syria, Wasserman Schultz defended the president and argued that he has support, unlike when the United States ""stood alone"" against Iraq.Although Democrats often criticize Bush for invading Iraq without more global backing, including that of the United Nations, Bush did put together a coalition. Nearly 50 countries, most notably Britain, ultimately supported the invasion, with many sending troops of their own. That's roughly on par with the support network that Obama has put together for action against Syria, and possibly exceeds it. We rate her claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Scott Walker hasn't done any public events in 2013, Democratic state senator says","Wait, what?""Just to be clear, Sly. His events, they're open to press, donors and for invited guests. I wouldn't consider that a public event,"" Larson said. ""A public event, I would consider something where folks, the working class, can actually make it, where it's not working hours and it's something where it's not invite-only.""So, the Milwaukee Democrat has his own idea of what constitutes a public event, although we’re not bound by that definition in rating his claim.Narrow definitionWhen we asked Larson to back his statement, he elaborated by saying that, besides being open without invitation and held outside of regular working hours, a public event should allow ordinary citizens to express opinions to or ask questions of the governor, he said.But that’s not evidence of what Larson said in the interview and it’s an even more narrow definition of public event.By that definition, most meetings of legislative committees -- typically scheduled during business hours -- are not ""public events."" And it suggests that when the governor visits a factory or business and talks to workers, it shouldn’t count simply because someone off the street couldn’t walk in and participate.So, Larson doesn’t exactly back off his claim. He just aims to shift it to more favorable terms for himself.Larson also pointed to a series of public hearings he held on evenings and weekends on the 2013-’15 state budget, saying Walker has appeared at no such events this year.There's no question that access to the governor -- really, any governor -- is limited.So, let's take a closer look at where Walker has been.Events in 2013Walker spokesman Tom Evenson sent us a list of more than 100 Walker events in 2013 that Evenson described as public. Some were easily accessible to the general public; others, because of cost, membership requirements or other reasons, weren't.Here's a sampling:So, attendance is limited at some public events Walker attended, but not at others.In any case, Larson’s claim was absolute.Our ratingLarson said Walker ""hasn't done a public event this entire year.""Larson may believe Walker needs to be more open, but it’s ridiculous to say Walker hasn’t done even one public event in 2013.We rate the statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chain email claims Dee Dee Myers says Amb. Chris Stevens and her relative were killed by mob abuse in Benghazi attack,"But this email caught our eye because it was purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers, who once served as White House spokeswoman for President Bill Clinton. The email played up the significance of a well-known Democrat breaking with President Barack Obama over what had happened in Benghazi.The reader wondered if it was actually written by Myers, and so did we.Moments after we contacted Myers’ office, she emailed us back, saying she had nothing to do with the account.""No, I didn't write it, don't have any relatives in the Benghazi Guard, didn't have any of the conversations or meetings described in the letter,"" she told PolitiFact. ""There is no truth to it whatsoever.""What the email saidThe email then purports to tell a disturbing story about what happened that night. In the email's version of events, the cousin dies as well:""... Ambassador Stevens was brutally murdered. His genitals were cut off, he was sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned. He was dragged thru the streets and left for dead. This is eyewitness testimony of a local Dr. who found the Ambassador in a ditch and tried to save his life.  He had no idea who he was. The other 3 men, including my cousin, met similar fates.""Death due to smoke inhalation is a 100% fabricated LIE. ... The next week I drove my aunt and uncle and 2 others to DC to receive his body. We met with Hillary, whom I remain friends with, Panetta, and Susan Rice. All apologized saying it was a protest gone bad over a video and exited the area. Next Obama entered with the same story and made no apology and offered little sympathy.""The email ends with a lament for the Clinton years:""The leadership of our country has reduced to lies and deception.......what has happened to us? How I long for President Clinton.""Myers herself told us she was not the author of the email and that its details concerning her or supposed relatives are fabricated.We still wondered whether there was any other evidence to support the email’s claims about how Stevens died. Was he ""sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned""?What we know about the night of the attacksBut the report makes no mention of any kind abuse to Stevens. Instead, it says he was brought to the emergency room by ""six civilians .. but to the best knowledge of the Board these were ‘good Samaritans’ among the hordes of looters and bystanders"" who arrived on the scene after the American personnel had left. The death, the report said, was due to ""apparent smoke inhalation.""These accounts also track with contemporary reporting.One key piece of evidence has not yet been made public: autopsy results. The FBI was charged with investigating the attack, but it has not yet produced a final report, which would presumably include an autopsy report. A call to the FBI on Sept. 6, 2013, confirmed that no report has been released yet. We will update this report when that information is publicly released.Our rulingThe chain email forwarded an account purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers of how her cousin and Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed in the Benghazi attack, including being ""sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned.""Myers told PolitiFact that she had nothing to do with the email, and that anything it said about her was false. As for the email’s claims about Stevens’ being violently attacked and violated rather than killed by smoke inhalation, two government reports and several contemporary journalistic accounts cast strong doubt. The one Web report that supports this scenario was recanted by the website after the mainstream media source it had cited, Agence France Presse, said it had reported no such thing.The email is a combination of fabrication and unsupported speculation. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Mike Huckabee says if you cut out just four states, U.S. gun-homicide rate drops to Belgium's level","In a recent Facebook post, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee used an unusual computation to play down the extent of firearm-related homicides in the United States.Beyond Huckabee’s curious formula, though, we wondered: Is he right?Let’s take a look at both ends of this claim.The United States StateFirearm-related homicidesPopulationRate of firearm-related homicides per 100,000 populationCalifornia1,25737,338,1983.36District of Columbia99604,91216.36Illinois36412,841,9802.83New Jersey2468,799,5932.79Four states above1,96659,584,6843.29U.S. total8,874309,330,2192.87U.S. minus four states cited by Huckabee6,908249,745,5352.77 So, removing the four states from the equation, as Huckabee did, doesn’t really budge the firearm-related homicide rate for the nation as a whole.Also, it’s worth noting that the three states Huckabee cited are not among the states with the highest rates of firearm-related deaths. (Washington, D.C., is, but it is an exception because it isn’t a state, but rather a city without suburbs or rural areas.) Several states have firearm-related death rates above 4 per 100,000, including one with strict gun laws (Maryland) but others in which Second Amendment protections are strong (Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina).BelgiumIn 2004, Belgium reported a firearm-related homicide rate of 0.7 per 100,000, which is well below both the United States as a whole and the U.S.-minus-Huckabee’s-four-states figure.So Huckabee’s comparison isn’t even close.Our rulingHuckabee said that ""America’s gun-related homicide rate … would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S.""Not only is this a strange way to analyze the numbers, but it’s not even correct on its own terms. Even after subtracting these four supposedly high-crime jurisdictions, the firearm-related homicide rate in the United States is still about four times higher than the rate in Belgium and the rest of Europe. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Bloggers say Obamacare provision will allow 'forced home inspections',"He wondered if it were true. So did we.South Carolina’s concern""Forced home inspections""? Um, no.Cook was there. And the comment nagged him. He noticed people weren’t really writing about the issue.""It's just been bothering me,"" he told PolitiFact.""The point is South Carolina legislators believe it, and are convinced this is going to happen,"" Cook told us.But that Obamacare program that worries Quinn? It already is — by statute — voluntary.There’s literally nothing to suggest raids or weapons.Home visiting programsBrown raises the specter of a home-schooling family subject to ""intervention"" for school readiness, their children forced into schools and onto medications and vaccines.""The federal government will now set the standards for raising children and will enforce them by home visits,"" he wrote about the law.But consent is built into the program.A home visitor could no more compel a family to vaccinate kids than a pediatrician could, said Kay Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School who’s one of the nation’s experts on state home visiting policy.Here’s how that might work, according to Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supports such programs.A low-income mom gets her prenatal care at a community health center. Her doctor asks if she would like visits from a nurse after the baby comes to offer tips and answer questions.Mom could say yes — or no.It’s like the old days of health care, Rosenbaum said, when nurses would visit families to show how to breastfeed, sterilize bottles, care for babies and cope when you’re exhausted.""It's real health education in the home, is the purpose of it,"" she said.Such programs have a long history backed by peer-reviewed research, she said. They work.""They make sure that you don't go home to nothing. It's done to help families, not to police them.""Brown, the lawyer, says he’s concerned families have no protection from social workers. He’s concerned workers won’t be well-trained and will overstep families’ rights.Nobody should knock on your door without a badge, he said.""What I see in this is a monster, frankly. And you can quote me on that,"" he said.That’s the fear.Any ""forced home inspection"" wouldn’t be under the law — it would be in direct opposition to it.And if a family welcomed help but later decided it made them uncomfortable?Samantha Miller, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency administering the program, said families could stop accepting services ""without consequence at any time and for any reason.""Our rulingBloggers passed around a claim last week that a provision of the new health care law will allow ""forced"" home inspections by government agents.But the program they pointed to provides grants for voluntary help to at-risk families from trained staff like nurses and social workers.What bloggers describe would be an egregious abuse of the law — not what’s allowed by it. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Cantor says Obamacare gives IRS access to personal health records,"During a recent floor debate, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned of dire consequences from the IRS implementing portions of Obamacare and collecting taxes to help pay for the health care reforms.He expressed distrust of the IRS, referring to disclosures earlier this year that the agency gave special scrutiny to the Tea Party and other conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. Giving the IRS access to personal medical records ""is nothing short of an unwelcome big government overreach into the most personal aspect of our lives,"" Cantor said.Shortly after his comments, the House, in a party-line vote, approved the ""Keep the IRS off your Health Care Act"" that would bar the IRS from any involvement in Obamacare. The measure, like 39 other House-approved bills that would end or dismantle the health care act, is expected to die in the Senate.We wondered whether Obamacare really would give the IRS access to records of our illnesses, surgeries and prescriptions.Starting in January, Obamacare will require people who can afford health insurance to buy coverage or pay a tax penalty. Many who are now uninsured are expected to buy policies through insurance exchanges that are being set up. The rule requires private companies participating in the exchanges to submit information about new customers to HHS so the agency can assure that these people have bought at least the minimum levels of coverage required by Obamacare and verify those receiving federal assistance buying their policies fall into qualifying income categories.The IRS will share tax information to help HHS determine whether low-income families and individuals qualify for assistance in purchasing insurance. A computer system is being developed that will give HHS instant access to that information. But it will be a one-way system, and the IRS will not be able to view HHS records.So how will the IRS identify uninsured Americans who must pay Obamacare’s penalty tax?In most cases, taxpayers will file their tax returns reporting their health insurance coverage, and/or making a payment, and there will be no need for further interactions with the IRS.""Our rulingCantor said that under Obamacare, ""the IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information."" But he offers no hard proof, just speculation on a blog.The IRS will play a major role in Obamacare by collecting a variety of taxes that will help support the program. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, IRS officials have repeatedly testified before Congress that they will not have access to the intimate details of anyone’s health records.Cantor’s unfounded statement does nothing more than amp up public fear for his ongoing fight to repeal Obamacare. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,United Nations document shared on social media says civilian gun confiscation is in the works for United States,"Americans who support the right to bear arms have long expressed worry that the U.S. government is on the verge of taking away lawful citizens’ guns, and that concern has only increased when a U.N. body is believed to play a supporting role.The document sent to us by the reader would seem to be (pardon the expression) a smoking gun.Superficially, the document has the trappings of officialdom -- a blue U.N. logo at the top, along with the name of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, a real office. It’s dated Aug. 5, 2013, and labeled ""restricted."" The headline reads, ""Disarmament Commission -- Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group."" And it’s filled with believable bureaucratic jargon, such as creation of a ""codification framework"" and the need to undergo a ""full review by the Office of the Secretary General.""Here’s the full text:""The issue of military grade weaponry in the hands of civilians looms ever larger in the face of the global implementation of 22/Agenda 21 by member nations. In particular, the United States of America has an estimated 500 million weapons in the hands of its civilian population. This is not just a static problem, it is a massive dynamic problem for the process of confiscation as there will be those who refuse to surrender their firearms.""The conclusion of discussions by the CWCSG led to the adoption of a proposed agenda to begin the process for introducing to member nations a framework by which they can begin codification of national laws to disarm civilians within their borders through a graduated process.""Within the discussion framework, we have identified several problem areas that must be addressed, they are:""1. Classification of military grade weapons to be made illegal for possession.""2. Creation of programs to provide reasonable compensation for voluntary surrender of said arms.""3. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of concealable firearms.""4. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of hunting grade firearms.""5. Codification of laws to restrict the sale of, and possession of ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition.""7. Creation of a United Nations Police Taskforce with the specific mission of assisting member nations with the collection of weaponry from civilian hands.""The CWCSG will submit its findings and final recommendations once we have created the codification framework for member nations for a full review by the Office of the Secretary General.""When we checked with the United Nations, a spokesman declared it a fake.""I checked the document number on our internal document system, and the reply I got back now was simply, ‘There is no document matching your request,’ said Farhan Haq, associate spokesperson for the Secretary-General. ""The document number (A/CN.11/L.72) doesn't conform to our standard system, in any case.""In addition, Haq said, ""there is no such body as a ‘Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group.’ Nor does the United Nations involve itself in confiscating weapons from member states.""Finally, Haq said, ""the use of blue ink, some of the type font and the scanner icon in the bottom right-hand corner are not found in real U.N. documents. So, in several different ways, this document is fake.""Our rulingA document found on the Internet and circulating via email and social media says that a United Nations working group has ""adopted a proposed agenda"" to enable member nations to ""disarm civilians within their borders."" If the document were real, it would confirm the worst fears of those who fear a mass confiscation of handguns, hunting rifles and ammunition in the U.S. -- but a United Nations spokesman cited several reasons for concluding that the document is a fake, including the fact that the study group referenced in the document does not exist. We rate the document Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Prospective House candidate says Austin school district has classrooms lacking electrical outlets,"A prospective Texas House candidate said some Austin schools shockingly lack a necessity.That does seem amazing. Does the Austin school district have classrooms lacking electrical outlets?Revisiting a board's discussionBy telephone, Ko told us he heard about such classrooms at a March 2013 meeting of the board of the Greater Austin Asian Chamber of Commerce in which board members discussed Austin school bond propositions on the May 2013 ballot. Ko said board member Catherine Crago said that some district schools ""average"" 0.5 outlets per classroom and, Ko said, Crago added that this means some classrooms have no outlets. Ko said he is an advisory board member of the chamber.By phone and email, Crago told us that at the meeting, she mentioned research she helped compile in the early 1990s that inventoried some five million square feet of Central Texas schools, counting among features each school’s windows and outlets. Crago said she did not say that she was referring to classrooms in the Austin district.Precisely, Crago said, she told board members that the research showed some Central Texas schools with 10 outlets per classroom and others averaging 0.5 outlets per classroom. She said she then asked an Austin district representative at the meeting: ""Is that still true?"" Crago said the representative nodded yes, which could have been in reference to Central Texas schools rather than Austin schools alone. Crago said her broader judgment is that older classrooms lack sufficient infrastructure to handle several computers in addition to a teacher's equipment.Did the Austin district official at that meeting agree that some classrooms lack outlets?That’s not the recollection of Perla Delgado, the district representative at the chamber’s board meeting, Alex Sanchez, a district spokesman, told us by phone. Delgado ""did not remember any specific question that she received or answered about electrical outlets,"" Sanchez said. ""It’s not something she said that even came up.""Separately, the executive director of the chamber, Marina Bhargava, said by phone that there was extensive discussion of the bond proposals at the meeting. She said she didn’t recall the electrical outlet moment, though such an exchange might well have happened.Austin district says classrooms have multiple outletsRecollections aside, do Austin classrooms lack outlets?Sanchez and other district officials said not.District spokesman Antonio Lujan said by email that there have been no classrooms lacking outlets for years. ""Even the district's oldest schools and portables would have several outlets in a room designated as a classroom,"" Lujan said. ""A classroom could not function without electrical outlets, and staff members would request to add them to accommodate the teaching environment.""Lujan passed along a response from Jeff Kauffman, the district’s director of construction management, stating that every classroom has an outlet. ""For new construction, every type of classroom, (from basic elementary school general-use classrooms to specialized computer classrooms in high school) has a minimum number of outlets (electrical and computer) required to fully operate the space as defined"" in the district’s educational specifications, Kauffman said.Kauffman said the specifications for a basic elementary school classroom (the least-wired situation) calls for a minimum of six electrical outlets with separate dedicated outlets (three to five) for computers..."" Kauffman said that more ""technology-based"" classrooms would have more outlets.""Older classrooms,"" Kauffman said, ""have had outlets added, as needed, to accommodate the use of the space."" Also, he said, new ""classroom portables have a minimum of eight electrical outlets and six data connections per classroom. Older portables have had outlets added, as needed,"" Kauffman said.Sanchez later said that according to Paul Turner, the district’s executive director of facilities, the typical district classroom has about six outlets, each of them enabling two plugs. Also, according to Turner, each classroom on average would have six ""drops,"" meaning electrical cables enabling multiple connections such as those needed for laptops. Sanchez said voters provided for the ""drops"" by approving a 1996 bond proposition.We shared the district’s replies with Ko, who said by email that the average number of outlets ""doesn't really speak to whether certain schools currently have classrooms that either lack working or usable outlets for whatever reasons."" He also said that he apologizes if what he thought he heard was incorrect.Our rulingKo said some Austin classrooms lack electrical outlets.We see no basis for this statement, which shakes out as horse-and-buggy ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Sarah Palin says GOP banned mention of Ayers in '08,"""I was banned from talking about Jeremiah Wright and Obama's friend, Bill Ayers, the character that he befriended and kicked off his political campaign in the guy's living room,"" Palin said. ""Couldn't talk about that.""Palin pointed a finger at who she thought was to blame.""I was not allowed to talk about things like that because those elitists, those who are the brainiacs in the GOP machine running John McCain's campaign at the time, said that the media would eat us alive if we brought up these things.""For those who might not remember, Bill Ayers lived in Barack Obama’s Chicago neighborhood and was an early supporter when Obama first ran for the Illinois state Senate. What made Ayers interesting in 2008 was that in the 1960s, he was one of the founders of the Weather Underground, a group that was responsible for bombings at a New York City police station, the Capitol, and the Pentagon. There were no injuries.Obama’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, brought up Ayers during the primary, but the issue failed to gain much traction.""He was a domestic terrorist,"" Palin said. ""And part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow.""And there’s even more to the story,"" Palin said. ""Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top adviser said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago.""Back then, we rated Palin’s statement Mostly True.""Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship,"" McCain said.""Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans.""It’s possible that Palin had wanted to talk about Ayers earlier in the campaign. We reached out to her Political Action Committee for clarification but did not hear back. But her words on Fox News gave no indication of anything but a ban.Our ruling"
PANTS-FIRE,Sen. Marco Rubio says 75% of small businesses say they’ll fire workers or cut hours under Obamacare,"In fact, he says, Congress should refuse to pass a spending bill that funds it, even at the risk of shutting down government. That’s because he sees ""mounting evidence of how Obamacare creates more problems than it solves, particularly for small business owners and the people who work for them.""One of those pieces of evidence: the number of small business who ""say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.""That creates a disastrous disincentive, he argues:""If you are a small business with about 47, 48 or 49 employees and you want to hire more people, Obamacare encourages you to hold back on hiring new workers or cut the hours of existing ones so that you don’t reach 50 employees. That is why 75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.""Do three in four American small businesses say the health care law will drive them to fire workers or cut their hours?Survey saysBut do 75 percent of small businesses say they face that pressure?""Despite the administration's controversial decision to delay forcing companies to join Obamacare for a year, three-quarters of small businesses are still making plans to duck the costly law by firing workers, reducing hours of full-time staff, or shift many to part-time, according to a sobering survey released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.""We read the the study and reached out to the chamber. And there’s a problem with that ""three-quarters of small businesses"" claim. Well, a series of problems, actually.Categories don’t add upThe study was conducted among a national sample of 1,300 executives for small businesses, defined as fewer than 500 employees and with annual revenue less than $25 million. It included chamber members and non-members ""weighted to be representative of the small business population.""The chamber told us executives were first asked whether the employer mandate would affect them:As a result of the health care law, the employer mandate will require employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to all full-time employees and their dependents or face a penalty. The law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours per week and the penalty is based on the number of full-time employees. Will you be impacted by the employer mandate?Just 17 percent of the small business executives said yes. So less than one in five businesses that participated in the survey said that the employer mandate would even affect them.Those 17 percent were then asked how they planned to respond. They could select as many answers as they felt applied to them:Please indicate how your business will react to this new mandate. Please select all that apply.a. Reduce hiring to avoid surpassing the 50 full-time equivalent employees (24 percent)b. Cut back hours to reduce the number of full-time employees (27 percent)c. Stop providing employee health insuranced. Replace full-time employees with part-time workers (23 percent)e. None of the aboveSo, the only way to reach 75 percent is to not only ignore the majority of executives who didn’t answer the question, but also to fold those who said they would ""reduce hiring"" with those who planned to cut hours or replace workers.And we just don’t know how many employers said, ""None of the above.""It’s also not clear from published results exactly what percentage of affected businesses said they would cut hours or replace workers.It could be as high as 50 percent, assuming there was no overlap between the executives who said they planned to replace full-timers with part-timers and those who said they would cut back hours. It could be as low as 27 percent, assuming total overlap — that the same people who said they would replace full-timers with part-timers also said they intended to cut back hours.So, of all small businesses in the study, how many said they would cut back hours or replace full-time workers in response to the health care law?Just 5 percent to 9 percent.Part of the problem, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, is that small employers don’t actually know yet how the law will affect them.""There's a lot of misinformation and a lot of ideology out there,"" Blumberg said.Our rulingRubio, arguing to defund Obamacare, said ""75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours."" That’s not remotely true. In the study of small businesses he cited, less than 10 percent said they might make that choice.His office cited a news article that misinterpreted ambiguous results from an interest-group survey. But basic statistics about America’s small businesses show the number was seriously unlikely, and a quick message to the U.S. Chamber exposed the error.Yet opinion pieces under Rubio’s name repeat the claim — one that’s so wrong, it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Chain email says Homeland Security can seize safe deposit boxes without notice,"Nothing screams Internet credibility quite like an entire paragraph in all caps, alternating text background colors and no fewer than five question marks in an email subject line.We recently received such a chain email insisting that bank safe deposit boxes merely let people ""entertain the illusion of safety."" (If anyone can persuade you to take your valuables out of the bank and stuff them in your mattress, please don’t let it be a stranger who just can’t figure out that caps lock key.)The message sent to PolitiFact read:U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS TOLD BANKS -- IN WRITING -- IT MAY INSPECT SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES WITHOUT WARRANT AND SEIZE ANY GOLD, SILVER, GUNS OR OTHER VALUABLES IT FINDS INSIDE THOSE BOXES!According to in-house memos now circulating, the DHS has issued orders to banks across America which announce to them that ""under the Patriot Act"" the DHS has the absolute right to seize, without any warrant whatsoever, any and all customer bank accounts, to make ""periodic and unannounced"" visits to any bank to open and inspect the contents of ""selected safe deposit boxes.""Further, the DHS ""shall, at the discretion of the agent supervising the search, remove, photograph or seize as evidence"" any of the following items ""bar gold, gold coins, firearms of any kind unless manufactured prior to 1878, documents such as passports or foreign bank account records, pornography or any material that, in the opinion of the agent, shall be deemed of to be of a contraband nature.This raises the question: Who keeps their porn in a bank safe deposit box? But porn aside, there was a lot to check out here.We contacted David McGuinn, president of Safe Deposit Specialists, a financial consulting firm that offers training, products and services to the financial industry. He told us he was flooded with phone calls when this claim resurfaced in 2013. He attributes it to the Cyprus financial crisis earlier this year.That’s when people started warning that something similar could happen in the United States, and the chain email started circulating again, McGuinn told us.""There’s no truth to that at all,"" he said.The Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs are groups McGuinn listed as potential officials who could force open a box with a search and seizure notice. McGuinn said this process doesn’t occur frequently.And when officials do open safe deposit boxes, there are safeguards in place.Rob Rowe, vice president with the American Bankers Association, explained that good cause must be proven in order for the Patriot Act to be used to open a safe deposit box, which is private property. The email in question cited the Patriot Act as the reason the DHS can seize this property, but Rowe said that isn’t the case.Also, DHS officials wouldn’t be able to open up boxes without bank officials present, he said.""The only way to open the box without the renter’s key is to drill the lock. If and when a box is drilled, standard bank operating procedures require dual control – the presence of two officers – and many jurisdictions also require that the locksmith who drills the box to be specially licensed or certified,"" Rowe said.When we contacted Homeland Security about the issue, an official cited the Fourth Amendment, explaining that searches and seizures by the department may only take place with probable cause and a court-ordered warrant.Our rulingVarious chain emails over the past seven years have warned readers about the possibility of Homeland Security seizing items like gold, silver and guns from their safe deposit boxes at the bank. This isn’t possible without first obtaining a search warrant, since those boxes are private property. And banking officials told us random seizures just aren’t happening. We rate this statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,If abortion measure passes El Pasoans will suffer long drive for cervical cancer screening,"Signed by party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, the letter said, ""If this bill passes, someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening at a clinic.""House Bill 2, which a House committee approved the day Hinojosa’s email went out and was awaiting Senate consideration as we posted this article, would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and toughen standards for abortion clinics. Opponents have said a provision that clinics must upgrade to the standards of ambulatory surgical centers could lead 36 of 42 clinics that perform most Texas abortions to shut down.When we contacted the Democratic Party about Hinojosa’s claim, spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that although the chairman’s San Antonio reference could be read as saying no El Paso facility would continue to provide such services, it was not intended that way.Hinojosa ""does recognize that there may be other clinics open for these screenings in El Paso,"" Allison said.""Our intention was to say that if you go to the clinics that are covered under HB2, you would have to drive 550 miles to get some of the services that you normally get locally,"" Allison said. ""We certainly could have been clearer and will be in future emails.""Still, we checked on conditions in El Paso for ourselves.So, if Reproductive Services were to shut down, would El Paso women have to drive 550 miles to get a test for cervical cancer?""That’s unbelievable. That’s not possible. I don’t even know where to start,"" said Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, which manages El Paso clinics’ participation in the state’s Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program.""There are a lot of organizations and institutions here that can provide access to those services,"" Valdes told us by phone. Lawmakers ""need to put all the facts together"" before making decisions that could affect funding for women’s health ""coming into needy communities like ours,"" she said. ""Many towns and hospitals are committing their monies to diagnostic screenings and diagnostic services and none of them are providing abortion services.""Valdes said she was not aware of the two clinics listed as abortion facilities, but said that any time a facility closes, it has a big impact on the women in the area who rely on its services. ""We have central locations,"" she said. ""Those are not long distances."" Access to transportation is a concern, she said, but the biggest issue can be making sure women know the services are available, especially with patients who get used to going to a single facility for years and don’t know of other options.Education and advice for such women is a main function of her organization, which subcontracts with 12 to 14 clinics and some private health care providers to help women get breast and cervical cancer screenings at low or no cost, Valdes said, and gives ongoing assistance to women diagnosed with cancer.The clinics do not provide abortions, she said, and so would not be directly affected by the legislation, although it could mean more women would seek their ""already overwhelmed"" services.Access to cervical cancer screenings in El Paso decreased when Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed, we learned from Valdes and Theresa Byrd, a professor at Texas Tech University’s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso.That is, such tests would still be available. Byrd said, ""In El Paso, is it easy to get service? No. You might have to wait, and it’s probably not as easy as it would be in other communities"" such as Houston.""But can you get them? Yes.""For women who have health insurance, Byrd said, the path starts with a visit to the obstetrician/gynecologist or family doctor. ""So many women in our community are uninsured that many of them use our federally qualified health centers,"" she said, naming El Paso’s three major providers in the state program: Centro San Vicente, Project Vida and Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe.Three or more health fairs held each year in El Paso also offer screenings, Byrd said, and cervical cancer tests are available in Juárez as well.Our rulingHinojosa said that if the abortion legislation passed, an El Paso resident would have to make a 550-mile trip to San Antonio for simple services like a cervical cancer screening.That’s not so; such services will continue to be available in El Paso, local experts say. This statement misses the mark so badly, it’s ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE, Rachel Maddow says that Ohio budget includes requirement for transvaginal ultrasound,"Ohio’s new operating budget calls for $62 billion in spending over two years and several abortion restrictions, including one that requires patients seeking one to first undergo an ultrasound. And while Democrats are plenty upset about the economics of the plan that Republican Gov. John Kasich ratified on June 30, they sense a political opening on the women’s issues.  Viewers of MSNBC’s ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" recently got a preview of the heated rhetoric that will typify this debate over the next 16 months as Kasich seeks a second term. Maddow, the cable news program’s liberal host, noted on her June 28 broadcast the anti-abortion measures the GOP-controlled General Assembly had added to the budget, which Kasich had yet to sign.  In interpreting some of the budget’s more-ambiguous abortion language, Maddow contended that the new regulations included a ""mandatory vaginal probe at the insistence of the state.""  Maddow was referring to a new requirement that women seeking abortions first receive ultrasounds to determine whether a fetal heartbeat is present. Her provocative words quickly went viral and sent PolitiFact Ohio in search of a full copy of the massive state budget.  Did it go as far as she claimed? Did it mandate a transvaginal ultrasound, as Maddow claimed, or did it allow for an external transabdominal procedure? We found our answer in the new Section 2919.191 that with the budget’s approval is now part of Ohio Revised Code.  Division A of that section says that before performing an abortion, a provider must ""determine whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat of the unborn human individual the pregnant woman is carrying."" The method for detecting a heartbeat is then spelled out in Division C, which says:  The director of health may promulgate rules pursuant to section 111.15 of the Revised Code specifying the appropriate methods of performing an examination for the presence of a fetal heartbeat of an unborn individual based on standard medical practice. The rules shall require only that an examination shall be performed externally.  In other words, not only are external methods such as transabdominal ultrasounds allowed under the new law; they are required. That sinks Maddow’s claim of a ""mandatory vaginal probe.""  We reached out to MSNBC and asked representatives if Maddow had anything more to say, but we did not hear back from them.  Because Maddow is an opinion leader on the left, others ran with her claim. The Raw Story, which describes itself as a progressive news website, called attention to the Maddow segment in a June 29 post. And on Twitter, several users seemed to parrot Maddow in tweets at Kasich.  ""Nothing says Small Government like a mandated trans vaginal ultra sound,"" read one tweet.  ""Ohio Gov @JohnKasich just ended his re-election chance, by signing into law mandatory big-government-forced object-rape of pregnant women,"" tweeted another critic.  Abortion is a hot-button issue in politics. And with Kasich up for re-election next year, it’s no surprise that Democrats are eager for a debate that draws contrasts with the governor.  But there should be no debate about what types of ultrasounds these new regulations require. Had Maddow read the language closely, she would have seen a mandate -- for external detection methods. That puts Maddow’s ""vaginal probe"" claim about as far as can be from the truth, into the realm of the ridiculous. "
PANTS-FIRE,Does the immigration bill include free 'Obamacars' for teens? ,"As chief defender on the right of the Senate immigration bill, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been churning out press releases debunking myths about the bill.Yep, you read that right: Rubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, issued a press release claiming that a conservative slam against the Democratic president is a myth.""Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes,"" the story said. ""The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill.""Are free ""Obamacars"" another rumor driven off track?The roots of the car rumorThe Breitbart article relied on an anonymous GOP Senate aide to explain the amendment:""This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job,"" the GOP aide said.Sanders amendment would provide transportation ‘services’Rubio’s press release states that transportation services ""means the program could provide a service, like a bus ride to a work site, but it cannot provide a car, scooter, motorcycle, or pair of rollerblades.""Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email that ""...the key word in the legislation is ‘service.’ That qualifier means that they will be provided ‘services’ and not ‘goods’ as in ‘goods and services’ (a common term when referring to tangibles and intangibles). In practice, it means the program can gives kids a bus pass – but it’s not giving them a car.""We asked Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser to Sanders, who would decide what could qualify as a transportation service. If the law passed, the U.S. Labor Department would have 20 days to create regulations for the jobs program and states would have 30 days to respond.Gunnels said that local workforce boards would come up with proposals that would be vetted by states and then submitted to the Labor Department, which would have the final say.So to believe the Obamacar claim would mean, for example, that a workforce board in Miami would suggest that it would give away free cars or motorcycles, Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s administrators would give that the thumbs up, and the Labor Department would declare that engines go. To be fair, it’s not expressly spelled out in the amendment that car/scooter/rollerblade giveaways are a no-no and that bus passes are a cheaper idea, but there is also no proof that the government would give away vehicles.Sanders provided PolitiFact a response via his spokesman:""This amendment addresses a crisis in youth unemployment in this country. The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds is 24.5 percent and higher for Hispanics and African-Americans. What my amendment says, which is obvious, is that providing a job for a young person is meaningless if they don’t have transportation to be able to get to that job. So the program has the option of providing funding for bus fare or subway tickets or other means of transportation. It is only the wild imagination that we have come to expect from Fox TV that would come up with this preposterous idea that we are buying automobiles for young people.""Our rulingAn amendment by Sanders to the immigration bill would provide a youth jobs program that includes the possibility of transportation and child care services. That prompted conservative news outlets to make claims such as, ""New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths.""Sanders’ amendment doesn’t define in detail what the transportation services would entail. Ultimately if the bill passes, local workforce boards would propose jobs programs that would be signed off by the states and approved by the U.S. Labor Department. There is no proof to support the idea that the program would include free car, motorcycle or scooter giveaways. In fact, that such a process would end up allowing car giveaways seems laughable.We are putting the brakes on this rumor. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,  State Rep. Ron Hood links abortion and breast cancer in legislation,"Among its provisions, the bill would require abortion providers to tell patients about ""the increased risk of breast cancer"" from abortion.PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know more about that warning. We called to ask Hood for the source.Research on a possible connection had been going on for decades when Brind published an analysis in the 1990s that suggested a link between induced abortion (the deliberate ending of a pregnancy) and an increased risk of breast cancer.But the analysis was based on studies that relied on survey interviews of women, which were widely questioned because of factors including ""response bias"" --  the inaccurate self-reporting of medical history information by participants.PolitiFact does not do medical or scientific analysis. We rely, as we do in other areas, on the most reliable and independent sources available.Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.Recognized spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.Women who have had an induced abortion have the same risk of breast cancer as other women.Women who have had a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) have the same risk of breast cancer as other women.Cancers other than breast cancer also appear to be unrelated to a history of induced or spontaneous abortion.The credible research overwhelmingly contradicts the statement in Hood’s legislation. It’s a ridiculous claim, and even more ridiculous to force doctors to spread this misinformation to patients. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"'Dhimmitude' on page 107 of the health care law exempts Muslims, claims chain email","Have you ever heard of ""Dhimmitude""? A chain email claims ""dhimmitude"" is on page 107 of the health care law, and it means Muslims will be exempt from the health care law.We don’t want to keep you in suspense, so we’ll tell it to you straight: The word ""dhimmitude"" is not in the health care law.What is ""Dhimmitude""? Well, here’s what the email claims:Dhimmitude -- I had never heard the word until now. I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting. It's on page 107 of the health care bill. I looked this up on Google and yep, it exists. It is a REAL word.Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam.ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States. Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be ‘gambling,’ ‘risk-taking,’ and ‘usury’ and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this.How convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivable, and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude.I recommend sending this on to your contacts. American citizens need to know about it.The dictionary says that dhimmi is a historical term used to describe a ""non-Muslim under protection of Muslim law,"" which could include Jews, Christians or Hindus. Adult male dhimmis were required to pay taxes and follow regulations on dress, occupation and residence. In return, dhimmis received ""security of life and property, defense against enemies, communal self-government, and freedom of religion practice."" The dictionary notes that dhimmi status has lost relevance in the present day because of the rise of nation-states and modern legal codes.We won’t dwell at length on the concept of dhimmis or of dhimmitude, since neither word is part of the health care law.The email goes on to claim that the health law specifically exempts Muslims. But that’s not the case either.In fact, this email is wrong on just about everything: The word ""dhimmitude"" is not in the law. Muslims are not specifically exempted. And if anyone is exempted, it’s a small number of Christian groups.For promoting absurd notions and wild fabrication, we have three words: Pants on Fire! "
PANTS-FIRE,"Michele Bachmann decries “huge national database” run by IRS with ""personal, intimate"" health care details","During a recent interview with Fox News, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., raised the specter of the Internal Revenue Service -- an agency currently under fire for appearing to target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- collecting a database full of ""intimate"" details about Americans.Referring to an inspector general’s report on IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, ""So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible.""In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s correct to say that the IRS is going to be in charge of ""a huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans’ ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets.""The editorial described a Federal Data Services hub that is taking ""the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency). The data hub will be used as the verification system for ObamaCare's complex subsidy formula. ...""Good luck in advance to anyone who gets caught in this system's gears, assuming it even works. Centralizing so much personal information in one place is another invitation for the IRS wigglers in some regional office—or maybe higher up—to make political decisions about enforcement.""We see four key questions for fact-checking Bachmann’s claim. First, is the government constructing a database? Second, will the IRS be ""in charge"" of it? Third, would it include ""personal"" or ""intimate"" details? And fourth, would it affect all, or most, Americans?We’ll take these issues in order.Is the government constructing a database?""This is not a huge national database of health records,"" said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom.Will the IRS be ""in charge"" of the hub?No. It’s being built by HHS, specifically by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To ensure compatibility, the IRS needs to cooperate with HHS on the effort, but the IRS has only a supporting role in building the system, and the IRS will not be able to use the hub to view information in the other agencies’ databases.Will the hub include ""personal"" or ""intimate"" details?The hub is not designed to access, much less store, information like body mass index, or whether you have a serious illness or ingrown toenails. The hub will be able to tell if someone has insurance or not, but it will not access records about their health. It could access other ""personal"" details beyond health status, including adjusted gross income and Social Security numbers, but those already exist in federal databases, so the hub wouldn’t represent an expansion of federal data collection.Would the hub affect all, or most Americans?So the numbers of Americans who might eventually interact with the hub aren’t trivial -- but it’s important to note that even if everyone who’s eligible takes the opportunity to use the exchanges, they would represent a small fraction of all Americans. People who have employer-provided insurance or are on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health care or most other forms of government-provided insurance should have no need to interact with the hub at all.Our rulingBachmann said the IRS is going to be ""in charge"" of ""a huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans’ ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets.""The congresswoman chooses to believe that the IRS and the rest of the government intend to delve ever-further into Americans’ personal lives. We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but as best we can tell now, she has mischaracterized the intent and limitations of the hub. It’s not a ""database."" The IRS isn’t running it. It won’t include ""intimate"" health data. And most Americans won’t need to interact with it at all. We rate her comment Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Ted Cruz: Democrats threatened to close Catholic Church hospitals and charities over their beliefs,"Reading that as a reference to the administration of President Barack Obama, we asked Cruz’s office for backup information.Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton, saying Cruz also was referring to congressional Democrats who voted for the health care overhaul known as Obamacare, emailed us links and articles from conservative and religious sources criticizing government decisions on how churches and affiliated organizations are to comply with the law’s mandate that insurance plans cover preventive care -- including an administration interpretation that this includes birth control without employees paying any out-of-pocket costs.None of the articles Rushton sent, though, showed Democrats or the government saying they would shut down churches’ hospitals or charities for failing to comply.In August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services ruled that insurance plans would have to cover sterilization and all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration, from condoms to hormone shots to ""morning-after"" pills, starting in August 2012 at the earliest.Those rules were finalized in 2012, and more changes have been proposed as of 2013, amid much public debate.In the 2012 rules, which are still in force, the government exempted some religious employers and gave them a year’s grace period before the requirements took effect.Bishops’ spokeswoman Sister Mary Ann Walsh told us by email that ""massive fines for non-compliance"" would force some groups to close, and the proposed changes would not fix the situation.""For a lot of nonprofit entities, such fines could run in the millions of dollars and would render their operations unsustainable,"" Walsh said.She did not give instances of the government threatening to directly close an institution. We searched for such communication to the church and came up empty.For his part, Obama said his administration sought to protect religious freedom with its rules for carrying out the mandate.I spoke directly to various Catholic officials, and I promised that before finalizing the rule as it applied to them, we would spend the next year working with institutions like Catholic hospitals and Catholic universities to find an equitable solution that protects religious liberty and ensures that every woman has access to the care that she needs.… The result will be that religious organizations won’t have to pay for these services, and no religious institution will have to provide these services directly.White House staff, Dolan wrote, told bishops’ conference staffers that reconsidering the mandate and widening the exemption were off the table.Cruz’s spokesman, Rushton, said companies facing similar contraception-providing requirements have sued and gotten injunctions delaying their fines. But once those delays and the religious groups’ grace period expire, he said, ""unless they win in court or the mandate is changed, these institutions will be fined out of existence.""Our rulingCruz, alluding to Obamacare’s contraception insurance coverage mandate, said Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesn’t change its beliefs.We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close.The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down.Perhaps. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandate’s exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs.This claim proved both incorrect and ridiculous.

PANTS-FIRE,Allen West says he has 'clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain',"First, some background on security clearances. There are three levels, in ascending order: Confidential, Secret and Top Secret. There are many subcategories, but the only one that is relevant here is an elite category of Top Secret called Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented information, or TS/SCI. It is for people who have Top Secret clearances but who may, in order to do their jobs, need to know certain information that is especially sensitive, such as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. A TS/SCI clearance allows them to know the information they need, but it is not a blanket clearance for all extremely sensitive information. That's why it's called ""compartmented.""We inquired with the Pentagon about his clearance but weren't able to get an answer Friday night. Experts we spoke to said that it was plausible for someone like West to have a TS/SCI clearance, so for the purposes of this fact-check, we'll assume he had that level. As you'll see below, his actual level wouldn't change our conclusion.Our experts also said that it's plausible that West would still have a Secret clearance today. Since retired officers can be called back to duty, and because many of them do consulting work for the military or for companies that work with the military, it's common for retired officers to maintain a security clearance.But what about him having ""a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain""?We see at least two ways to look at this claim.The first is that West is saying that he had a higher security clearance than someone occupying the office of president of the United States. Even if you assume that he was referring to the period in which West held a TS/SCI, our experts say he's wrong.John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. ""This is a silly statement,"" Pike said. ""The only clearance the president needs is the mandate of the people.""The statement is even more questionable if West was actually referring to what he says is his current clearance -- Secret.""A Secret security clearance is the most commonly held security clearance,"" Aftergood said. ""Almost anyone without a criminal record or serious financial difficulties can get such a clearance if their employment requires it.""There's one more possible interpretation, and when we reached the West campaign, they said this is indeed what the candidate meant at the forum. As a career military officer, West went through a rigorous screening and investigatory process in order to receive his TS/SCI clearance. President Barack Obama got his authority by virtue of a popular vote. There is no security process required before one becomes president.If, in theory, Obama was not president and decided to apply for a security clearance, there's no guarantee he'd qualify for one. He'd have to go through a painstaking process, and investigators may raise any number of questions.""The fact that (Obama) admitted to cocaine use, travel to unauthorized countries years before, and his associations with (black nationalist) Louis Farrakhan and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, he probably would not have been granted a security clearance,"" said Josh Grodin, West's campaign manager.This argument does at least have a grain of validity to it. But we see some problems with it.Pike said that the one thing in Obama's background that could raise a flag for someone doing a security check is ""his unaccompanied foreign travel for an extended period of time."" Still, he added, ""the tender age at which Obama traveled abroad would almost certainly render this irrelevant, particularly in light of everything else he has done.""To the extent that West has already been cleared by national-security vetters, and Obama has not, we think West may have a small point. Still, even using this logic, West oversteps when he says that his own clearance is one ""that even the president of the United States cannot obtain."" We don't believe the evidence suggests that it's an open-and-shut case that Obama would be denied the kind of security clearance West had."
PANTS-FIRE,Allen West says Ron Klein repeatedly voted for amnesty,"Our conclusion here is crystal clear: West's campaign admits that it wrongly characterized Klein's views on amnesty, and it had done so in the 2008 campaign as well. Illegal immigration is a hot-button emotional topic. We give the West campaign credit for changing the website on the same day we asked questions, but the claim about amnesty was flat-out wrong. We rate this Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Sen. Barbara Boxer says Condoleezza Rice didn't know how many troops had died in Iraq,"Boxer makes it sound like Rice either didn't know or didn't care about the number of soldiers who had died and that Boxer was nobly calling her out. In fact, she was asking Rice to speculate about casualties in the future. We find the senator's revisionist account to be far from the truth and disparaging of Rice. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Alabama Congressional candidate Rick Barber's ""Gather your armies"" ad goes viral","Say this for Alabama candidates, they know how to make political ads that get noticed.The kicker comes from the George Washington character, who delivers his response through gritted teeth: ""Gather ... your ... armies.""Conservative radio host G. Gordon Liddy was kinder, but Barber got some harsh treatment from fellow tea party cheerleader Glenn Beck. On his radio show, Beck called Barber, ""one of the dumbest people I have seen."" Ouch.Added Beck, ""What the hell are you thinking? What is wrong with you? ... I know it's been a tough couple of years. It may not be time, yet, to 'Gather your armies.' This Republican is a dope."" Double ouch.Barber insists his ad was not intended to advocate a violent overthrow of the government.""That couldn't be further from the truth,"" Barber said. ""It's a call to action.""We won't get into that debate, but we did think it was worth assessing some of Barber's claims about the IRS.Here's some of what Barber says in the ad (remember, he's supposedly talking to some Founding Fathers).""Now this same IRS is going to force us to buy health insurance. Cram it down our throats, or else. Now I took a took an oath to defend that with my life [points at copy of Constitution] and I can't stand by while these evils are perpetrated.""Let's start with the claim that ""without representation, they (the IRS) can increase taxes, impose costly regulation or conduct malicious audits.""The IRS has does not have the statutory authority to increase taxes. That's entirely up to Congress.We'll cite that Constitution Barber poked in the ad.Section 8 begins, ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes ...""And Amendment 16, ratified in 1913, lays out Congress' ability to levy income taxes: ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""So it's Congress that controls whether to increase taxes.We spoke to Barber, and he said some people are taking the ad way too literally.""Some pieces of that ad are metaphorically speaking,"" Barber said.Barber said that when he said that ""without representation"" the IRS ""can increase taxes,"" he meant that our elected leaders in Washington are not ""properly representing their constituents.""""Unfortunately we don't have good representation in office that listens to the voice of the people,"" Barber said.For the record, Barber explained, he's not opposed to taxes. Rather, he's in favor of a ""Fair Tax."" Under that plan, all federal income taxes would be replaced with a consumption tax on retail sales.But we think it's disingenuous for Barber to hide behind a claim that his ad is meant figuratively. How else can one interpret a claim that ""without representation,"" the IRS can increase taxes? The IRS doesn't increase taxes. Congress does. You may not agree with what legislators have done with the tax codes, but legislators are duly-elected representatives.It's also misleading for Barber to claim ""this same IRS is going to force us to buy health insurance.""Because people could opt to simply pay the tax penalty and refuse to buy insurance, there is some debate over whether it's correct to say that people will be ""forced"" to buy health insurance. We think many people would reasonably describe a tax penalty as a mandate. But it would be wrong to suggest the IRS is the one requiring people to buy insurance. To the extent insurance will be required, that was a decision of a duly-elected Congress.Lastly, we take issue with Barber's comment that the Founding Fathers revolted against the British over a tea tax.We'll let Robert Middlekauff, a professor emeritus of colonial and early United States history at the University of California, Berkeley, take it from here.""The issues that divided Americans and the British government were far more complicated than the tax levied on tea,"" said Middlekauff, who has written several books on early American history. ""The Americans insisted from the Stamp Act crisis on that a free people could be taxed only with their own consent, and only their own representatives could give it. They were not represented in Parliament, and could not be, given the character of that body and the problems of representation in an empire. ... There were other related uses involving the British use of troops against the colonies, the corruption of imperial officials, and the essential rights of Americans.""Barber said he was constricted by the limits of a 60-second commercial.""It's such a short period of time to try to give a history of how the American Revolution started,"" Barber said.""You only get 60 seconds to get your message out, to start a discussion,"" he said.We have no doubt that the Founding Fathers would be displeased if things had gotten to the point where ""without representation,"" the IRS could increase taxes. But it can't. The tax codes, complicated as they may be, unfair as they may seem to some, were voted on and approved by duly-elected legislators. That's the very definition of representation. Call it figurative or metaphorical language, the bottom line is the statement is flat-out wrong. And we suspect the Founding Fathers wouldn't like being misled. We rule Barber's statement Pants on Fire."

PANTS-FIRE,Barnes suggests mining the Capitol for education gold,"Okay, okay. We here at PolitiFact Georgia know that politicians are occasionally given to hyperbole.From time to time the political class seems driven to test the bounds of rhetorical gravity. And we feel inclined to test what they say.Take former Gov. Roy Barnes, a skilled orator and shrewd trial lawyer who to can turn on the aw-shucks routine with the best of them.Earlier this year, Barnes spoke in Summerville as part of the Chattooga County Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting. And man-oh-man did he ever come up with the money quote as noted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press, which reported it in a news story about his speech.""If we have to scrape the gold off the gold dome, you make sure that education comes first,"" Mr. Barnes told the group, according to the news article. He made the same claim in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an opinion piece he penned in 2008. “If  we have to scrape the gold off the Capitol dome to do it, so be it. It's worth it, and we owe it to our children,’ Barnes wrote.The state’s schools are in tough shape due to the grinding recession that has withered property values and diminished state and local coffers. The schools now need billions to avoid furloughs, layoffs and school closings.Chris Carpenter, Barnes’ campaign manager, said Barnes made the statement to show how important he considers education. The former governor has also mentioned closing the Governor’s Mansion and the state Capitol – the same one he wants to relieve of its gold top – to raise money for state schools.“He just thinks public education is the No 1 priority,” Carpenter said.  “Obviously there is some rhetorical flourish there.”Flourish, smourish. We wanted to know how much the state could get if it the gold leaf was actually scraped off the venerable old dome and sold.Not a lot, as it turns out, despite the fact that gold has recently surged past $1,200 an ounce.Gold first graced the dome after a late 1950s Capitol renovation in which the old tin-covered dome as was done up in 43 ounces of the glittering stuff. It was milled to 1/5000th of an inch thick before being affixed to the roof. The gold originally traveled to Atlanta from Dahlonega, site of the nation’s first gold rush, in a caravan of seven mule-drawn covered wagons, which took three days to reach Atlanta.The gold was expected to last thirty or forty years but by the late 1970s it had deteriorated to the point that the dome to be re-gilded, a project completed in 1981.Mike Kramer, owner and president of The Gilder’s Studio, runs the Maryland-based company that re-gilded the dome again in 1998. Workers first scraped off what was left of the old gold.“We had people that parked at the Capitol complaining because we were getting gold scrapings on their cars,” Kramer said in a telephone interview.Kramer reckons his company used about 85 ounces of gold gilding material. He said the new dome should be good for another 20 or even 30 years – as long as politicians don’t start scraping on it.As for Barnes’ idea about cashing in on the shiny Capitol covering, Kramer was, well, less than enthusiastic.“You’d have to dry scrape it off, and I’d probably charge a hundred-grand for that,” he said.  “Then you have to contain it. Then you have to refine because it’s attached to the zinc-chromate primer.”Kramer figured that only about 60 ounces of the original gold could be salvaged. A refiner would charge you 20 percent or so to extract it once it was scraped off, he said.So at $1,200 an ounce, you get about $72,000 for 60 ounces. Subtract the refiner’s fee and you’re down to $57,600. By the time you pay Kramer his $100,000 for scraping the orb in the first place, you are actually in the hole by more than $40,000.“You’re not going to make any money,” Kramer said.In fact you would lose money, and end up with a naked Capitol dome. And nobody wants that. We give the former governor a Pants On Fire for this one."
PANTS-FIRE,Perry says Democrat Bill White sent President-elect Obama a message on selling cap and trade,"Next, we contacted an Austin advertising firm to get another take on whether White's e-mail reads like advice on how to sell cap and trade, as Perry puts it. Patrick Cline, a partner at JH&A Advertising, credited White's message with couching in step with an understanding that a cap-and-trade plan could wreak havoc with the state's petrochemical plants. But, Cline said, White's note stops short of being a primer on selling cap and trade to the American people.Our conclusion: White's e-mail is not close to the ""how-to"" guide Perry claims. Indeed, White's message urges the incoming administration not to push a carbon emissions proposal until after it has advanced other energy-related ideas. Nowhere does the e-mail offer guidance on pitching cap and trade.Perry floats a politically potent but inaccurate, ridiculous characterization. Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Fanelli's video suggests 'Obamacare' will cut off treatment for elderly,"So to recap, Fanelli's ad offers a dramatic scene that has no solid facts behind it. He claims it portrays ""Obamacare,"" but he cannot cite any provisions in the health care bill -- other than vague fear of a European system -- that could cause such a tragic scene. He referred us to his wife's dermatologist -- who also happens to be the star of the commercial -- but the dermatologist did not produce any conclusive evidence, either.So the ad has lots of melodrama but no facts. We find the claim Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"La bonne vie? Democratic chairman says Perry is living large, a la Louis XIV","Not really, replied Kirsten Gray, the party’s spokeswoman. “It was a humorous analogy, not based in fact,” she told us in an e-mail.We guessed as much. Allow us to have some fun, too, by taking a look back at France's Sun King.First: How did the king, who lived from 1638 to 1715, make it day to day? Like his father before him, biographies suggest, he often was on the move, waging war (the “natural condition of nations” in the era, recapped Nancy Mitford, in her book, “The Sun King”) or hunting while staying in palatial abodes capped by his beloved chateau at Versailles, which he proclaimed the seat of government in 1682.Versailles, of late a spectacular tourist attraction, grew on the king’s watch to include picture-perfect gardens, a theater holding 3,000 spectators, a vast hall of mirrors, hundreds of imported orange trees (many planted indoors in silver tubs)--all of that a far cry from the rustic hunting lodge his father had enjoyed there. That building, which his son preserved, consisted of just (only) (barely) 20 rooms plus a men’s dormitory.Tuneful aspect of the king’s lifestyle: He was seldom without music, awakening each morning to the playing of a live band, according to Mitford.So, how does Perry fare comparatively?We’re unaware of live bands playing as Perry awakens. And the governor doesn’t routinely hunt (though he recently said he shot and killed a coyote during a jog) nor is he known to bounce from palace to palace nor has he declared war -- except on Washington.Then again, Perry incorrectly maintained last year that Texas could secede; his intimation could be seen as war-like.Yet Perry's temporary home, in a gated community in the hills 11 miles southwest of downtown Austin, hardly compares to the spread at Versailles, which Placesinfrance.com describes as having 700 rooms, over 1,200 fireplaces and 67 staircases.The house has a gourmet kitchen, three dining rooms and seven bathrooms, the AP reported. That gives Perry more private thrones with plumbing than the king who, given his times, was limited to chamber pots.The AP's article itemizes various state-covered expenses at the rental home: $18,000 for ""consumables"" such as household supplies and cleaning products, $1,001.46 in window coverings from upscale retailer Neiman Marcus, a $1,000 ""emergency repair"" of the governor's filtered ice machine, a $700 clothes rack, and a little more than $70 for a two year subscription to Food & Wine Magazine.Maintenance on a heated pool on the property’s three acres has cost taxpayers at least $8,400, the AP said, and the tab for grounds and lawn maintenance has topped $44,000. All told, taxpayers have spent at least $592,000 for rent, utilities, repairs, furnishings and supplies since Perry moved in. By comparison, the AP noted, the governor's mansion is wholly owned by the state — there is no rent or mortgage to pay. As configured, it has about 9,900 total square feet, but most is public space packed with historic artifacts. Only 2,750 square feet is dedicated to the governor's residence.Perry critics have floated alternative temporary housing ideas. The governor could occupy a mobile home (as Mike Huckabee boasted of doing while governor of Arkansas). Of late, the Texas AFL-CIO offered to rent a manufactured home to the governor for $1 a year.Or Perry could bunker in at a hotel. At the La Quinta Inn at the Texas Capitol, the nightly rate for a suite, starting June 1, would run $120 plus tax, though a room with a standard King bed, plus a refrigerator and microwave, would cost $90 plus tax, according to the assistant general manager, Zina Carter. There's also a pool, the hotel website says; we'll guess it's not heated.Summing up: Louis XIV had it all for his age. He gamboled, he hunted, he warred; lived large.Though Perry’s hardly giving the king a run for his money, he has had a bonanza of a run as well--healthy wife, children, multiple elections with nary a loss. He’s often said he has the world’s best job. We’ll speculate he’s good with his rental quarters."
PANTS-FIRE,White says taxpayers paid for Perry to fly Texas delivering checks in five communities,"In a Facebook post Wednesday, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White suggests Gov. Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas cities to give out money.“In three days last week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers’ expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks,” White’s 8:43 p.m. post states.Did Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks?Katy Bacon, White’s spokeswoman, pointed out news releases issued by the governor’s office reflecting Perry’s stops May 11-13 in Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2 million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases.That’s close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry.We wondered, though, at White’s description of Perry’s flights as costing taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources including his campaign kitty — an approach often mentioned in news articles, including a July 26 report in White’s hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle.The Chronicle article quotes Perry’s gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that “Perry's travel is not paid by taxpayers.” It continues: “Texas One, a corporate-finance foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors or interest groups.”As for the flights Facebooked by White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: “These were all ‘official’ trips and events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is typically paid for by taxpayers.”Not so, said Castle, who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perry’s campaign. “The majority of the governor’s travel is paid for by his campaign,” she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry.There is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip — his security detail. In a follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security expenses.Bacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents, that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster.""Either way, this is wrong,"" she said. ""He’s running around handing out taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. He’s using campaign dollars to hand out state checks."" She showed us that Perry's campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a campaign e-mail blast.Bacon's charge shifts the focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook.All in all, White got several things right — five cities visited, press events, money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the governor goes anywhere.But White's crucial assumption — that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense — is wrong. It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local newspaper.Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Florida Dems say Bill McCollum out of touch on subprime mortgage crisis,"For this item, we wanted to check the Democratic Party's claim that McCollum said he didn't think the subprime mortgage crisis was a big deal, that it had been exaggerated by the media and said that ""it's not the end of the world."""
PANTS-FIRE,"Bill White objects to what he calls ""Soviet-style"" budget management by Republican leaders","In a public interview hosted by the Austin-based Texas Tribune, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White compared Republican leadership on state budget woes to how things swung in ye olde U.S.S.R.White said March 9 he’d take a more deliberate approach to spending than the state's top leaders, all Republican, who asked government agencies in January to suggest ways to cut their budgets by 5 percent. White said if he's in charge, ""it won’t be done by things that are just across the board, Soviet style, you know, budget management that only career politicians seem to embrace.""Pressed by interviewer Evan Smith, White said: ""Is it just a coincidence that 5 percent is the appropriate amount for each state agency?... No. It’s because that’s the way that career politicians know how to run government.""We started our review of White's statement wondering what ""Soviet-style"" budget management means. Several expert professors said that historically, the term didn't refer to across-the-board budget cuts.Professor Paul Gregory of the University of Houston Department of History said ""Soviet style"" makes him think of a monopoly party (in this case, the Communist Party) dictating everything to subordinates without any possibility of change. Gregory said Soviet-style budgeting also means hiding expenditures you don’t want people to see—such as massive investments in military infrastructure.Peter Caldwell, a Rice University professor of history, said budget-writing in the Soviet Union most often consisted of “huge and crude” decisions to invest in one part of the economy at the expense of another.And H. Stephen Gardner, chairman of the Baylor University Department of Economics, said he’d define Soviet-style management as overly centralized as opposed to giving autonomy to individual units of government.So are there ""Soviet style"" ways that state leaders have approached the budget?Some background: In January, Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus--mindful of a projected state revenue shortfall that could reach $15 billion by next January--jointly asked agencies to submit plans identifying savings in 5 percent “priority increments” in their 2010-11 appropriations from state revenue. Such plans could lead to cuts, though no decisions have been made and some programs have already been excused.No doubt, the leaders' request is a centralized one. But is it Soviet-style in any other way? We turned to White for elaboration.White’s campaign pointed us to a statement issued by White, the former Houston mayor, in January: “Well-run organizations cut spending based on priorities and where they can best attain productivity improvements. So, for example, in the city of Houston we made smaller cuts in public safety because that was the highest priority. And we were able to cut more in garbage collection and disposal through productivity improvements.”White then told us that by ""Soviet style,"" he doesn't mean that Texas state government owns the means of production, as in the Soviet Union. “Obviously we have a market system,” White said.He described his alternative approach to the looming revenue gap, saying that as governor, he'd focus on funding priorities such as education while encouraging agencies to improve productivity via ""process re-engineering"" without hurting the delivery of services to taxpayers. He said the state also would seek savings by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, he said, there’d be regular meetings with agency chiefs to talk about how they’re cutting spending and avoiding non-essential hirings.“I would have had reports back to me weekly and monthly concerning the efficiencies identified,” White said. We didn't get to why White considers the existing approach ""Soviet style"" before he had to go.We asked the professors if ""Soviet style"" accurately characterizes the GOP leaders' request for proposed budget cuts.Gregory said describing the request from Perry, et al. that way “doesn’t seem to have any relevance to what was actually practiced in the Soviet Union. ... It's inappropriate to use that term.""Gardner agreed, saying: ""It’s a bit hyperbolic to refer to this (budget cutting) as Soviet style. I should admit I have done exactly the same thing myself on matters of budgeting.”The point of saying as much, Gardner said, is to elicit an emotional reaction. He added that Republicans who cast President Barack Obama as socialist — Perry has told reporters he thinks Obama has socialist beliefs — are likewise guilty of hyperbole for dramatic effect. The professor, who said he considers Obama a centrist, speculated that Noam Chomsky, a left-leaning linguist who writes on public affairs, would call the president a ""crazed capitalist.""""If White’s point is that budget management is being handled in an overly centralized way,"" Gardner said, ""I can see the element of truth there. The problem I would have is even if you say I am going to be more careful and more surgically look at the right places to cut, you’re still using a more centralized approach.”Caldwell agreed with the psychological impact, if not the accuracy, of ""Soviet style."" Generally, he said, “anyone who ever mentions the Soviet economy or Naziism when they’re talking about American domestic debate is usually off track. They’re referring to crude examples to raise the stakes of a debate. They’re not necessarily wanting a careful, rational debate. Who in America wants the Soviet economy or supports Naziism?”Our conclusion? The GOP leaders' request that agencies submit proposed budget cuts isn’t Soviet style — not even close.At best, White's statement is an example of how politicians try to light up a room. It's so off base, we're lighting up the meter: Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Rubio tries to blame Crist for health care overhaul,"Brendan Daly, a Pelosi spokesman, said that because no House Republicans supported the bill, that he ""does not think Crist was instrumental in passing it.""We asked Kate Kelly, a spokesman for Specter, if Crist's support had been a key factor for the Pennsylvania senator. She replied, ""Sen. Specter has never mentioned that as a reason he voted for the stimulus.""First, health care reform pre-dates the 2009 economic stimulus by years -- or even decades.Second, Rubio has failed to prove a causal connection between the two. It's not like the stimulus bill created some kind of legal foundation for health care reform -- it was a bill filled with tax cuts and spending to boost the economy. And it's not like it provided Obama with a huge surge of momentum. Indeed, more than a year lapsed between the final passage of the stimulus and the health care bill."
PANTS-FIRE,"Rep. Silvestre Reyes says census audit found more than 370,000 Texans were missed by 2000 census, costing $1 billion in federal aid","Urging constituents to return their filled-out 2010 census surveys to the federal government, U.S Rep. Silvestre Reyes refers to a dramatic blast from the past.The El Paso Democrat states in a March 11 e-mail: “An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result.”Does Reyes get his big numbers right? And if there was an undercount, did it cause Texas to miss out on a big chunk of federal aid?For starters, we found no such audit, and Reyes’ office didn’t provide back-up for his statement. However, a 2001 PriceWaterhouseCoopers study prepared for the U.S. Census Bureau Monitoring Board, an entity that no longer exists, stated that nationally, the 2000 census failed to count some 3.3 million residents, including 373,567 Texas residents.The undercount figures were attributed to the Census Bureau and Eugene Ericksen, a Temple University sociologist.Some perspective: Reyes’ recent e-mail harkens to concerns aired in 2000, especially by Democrats, that without an adjustment the census would fail to account for many residents, mainly racial minorities and renters. The bureau did not adjust its count of the nation’s population.The 2001 report said the undercount could result in a federal funding loss of $4 billion across 31 states (including Texas) and the District of Columbia. It raised the prospect of California and Texas losing the most, $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from fiscal 2002 to 2012.A press release accompanying the report included this warning from Peter Merrill of PricewaterhouseCoopers' National Economic Consulting group: “Inaccuracies in the census can cause federal funds to be distributed in a way that is not fully consistent with congressional intent. The census undercount not only misallocates funds among jurisdictions, it also causes a net loss to the states of funds from federal entitlement programs. Compounding the problem, many state-funded grant programs to localities also rely on census counts.”Does the report still hold water?Our finding: Like a sunk boat.About two months after the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report came out, the Census Bureau said it would reassess how accurately it had counted the nation's residents in 2000. And in 2003, the bureau announced new estimates for what the 2000 counts for each state should have been.And there was another twist: Instead of undercounting the nation's population, the bureau concluded it had over-counted by about 1.3 million people.David Whitford, chief of the bureau’s Decennial Statistical Studies Division, told us that the bureau ultimately realized that undercounts nationally were more than offset by double-counting of many individuals and other errors. One example: counting students away at college while also recording them as part of their parents' household back home.Some population groups were affected more than others. The bureau said it had overcounted whites, Asians, American Indians on reservations and young children, the Associated Press reported, while many blacks and Hispanics were missed.There was still a small net undercount (by 10,245 people, or .05 percent) in Texas, the bureau said. The census count of Texans should have been 20,862,065, the bureau estimated.Where does this leave the PriceWaterhouseCoopers study? Professor Ericksen told us that by repudiating its initial undercount estimates, the bureau effectively invalidated both the population figures and federal aid estimates.And Merrill of PriceWaterhouseCoopers cautioned against using its 2001 report for another reason: ""It is certainly out of date... Our firm is not telling anyone that the analysis done in 2001 is relevant for today.""Vincent Perez, Reyes' press secretary, said he's been unable to get the Census Bureau to confirm that it backed off the estimate that more than 370,000 Texas residents weren't counted in the 2000 census.How does Rep. Reyes’ statement stand up?Reyes incorrectly refers to the consultant’s projections as an audit of the census; it was a report.More importantly, Reyes relies -- as have other entities -- on an outdated report based on numbers the Census Bureau has said were flawed. The bureau long ago yanked the statistical rug out from under the claim that more than 370,000 Texas residents were not counted and that Texas stood to miss out on $1 billion in aid as a result.This isn't a close call. We rate Reyes' statement as Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Florida Republican Party claims Democratic health care plan is government takeover,"If you've been following the health care debate, you've surely heard this line from Republicans: The Democratic plan is a ""government takeover"" of the nation's health care system. That's a potent talking point for the GOP because it conjures images of a sluggish, state-run bureaucracy.""This morning while Congressman Allen Boyd is deciding whether or not he’ll support the trillion dollar Obama-Pelosi-Reid government-run health care experiment, and since the voicemail boxes at his offices are full, the Republican Party of Florida decided to remind the Congressman of what some of his constituents had to say about the government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy."" The release had links to YouTube videos of people speaking against the plan at Boyd's town hall meetings.Before we delve into the big reasons why it's wrong, we should note that the sentence has a tiny element of truth -- that health care accounts for nearly 20 percent of the economy. Indeed, the latest estimate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that health care accounted for 17.3 percent of the economy last year and is expected to grow to 19.3 percent by 2019.The one significant element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the latest version, Medicaid would be expanded to cover anyone below 133 percent of poverty level. That's estimated to add about 18 million people to Medicaid rolls. Still, that's far short of a ""government takeover,"" a phrase that suggests a complete government-run health care system."
PANTS-FIRE,J.D. Hayworth claims Massachusetts ruling opens the door for man-horse marriage,"J.D. Hayworth, the former congressman running against Sen. John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary, was known for making provocative points as a conservative radio talk show host. He's proving every bit as provocative on the campaign trail.Let's get the full quote straight from the horse's mouth:""You see, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, when it started this move toward same-sex marriage, actually defined marriage -- now get this -- it defined marriage as simply, quote, the establishment of intimacy,"" Hayworth said. ""Now how dangerous is that? I mean, I don't mean to be absurd about it, but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point -- I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse. It's just the wrong way to go, and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support.""Whoa there. Really?Hayworth is talking about a landmark 2003 case in which the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled, 4-3, that gay couples have the right to marry under the state's Constitution.The word ""intimacy"" appears five times in the 45-page decision (actually six times, but one is a duplicate), but never in the context of being the sole definition of marriage. Here they are:* One section talks about how the Supreme Court has affirmed that ""the core concept of common human dignity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes government intrusion into the deeply personal realms of consensual adult expressions of intimacy and one's choice of an intimate partner.""* ""Marriage also bestows enormous private and social advantages on those who choose to marry. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family.""* ""Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family -- these are among the most basic of every individual's liberty and due process rights.""* ""Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family.""* ""Similarly, the Supreme Court has called for increased due process protection when individual privacy and intimacy are threatened by unnecessary government imposition.""We're not sure how Hayworth gets from any of these to the court defining marriage as simply the establishment of intimacy.Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall of the state's Supreme Judicial Court began the ruling with these words:""Marriage is a vital social institution. The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations. The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not.We italicized ""person"" to make a point.Justice John Greaney, who concurred, wrote in the ruling, ""We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others.""Again the word ""persons.""Moreover, Greaney noted that the ruling was strictly about whether people of the same sex could marry and ""it leaves intact the Legislature's broad discretion to regulate marriage.""Seems pretty straightforward to us, but we checked with a few legal experts in Massachusetts to get their take.""It's so far off base,"" Cunningham said. The ruling, she said, ""didn't change anything there about the marriage law in Massachusetts,"" which very clearly spells out that marriage is only for people.Maddow: ""Where does the establishment of intimacy thing come from? Where in Massachusetts law or in the Supreme Court ruling does it say the establishment of intimacy?""Maddow said she had spent the afternoon looking for it, but couldn't find it anywhere.Hayworth: ""As we went back and reviewed that document back when the argument was made, the high court in Massachusetts defined marriage in a rather amorphous fashion, simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy. Now I think we all agree there's much more to marriage than that.""Maddow: ""Sir, I'm sorry, it didn't.""Hayworth: ""Okay, you and I have a disagreement.""Maddow then cited several uses of the word ""intimacy"" in the Supreme Court ruling.Maddow: ""The establishment of intimacy as the definition of marriage, it's just not there, let alone the horse thing. What you said about the establishment of intimacy being the definition of marriage in Massachusetts, I don't think it's true, sir.""Hayworth: ""Well, that's fine. You and I can have a disagreement about that.""Maddow: ""Well, it either is true or it isn't, it’s empirical.""Hayworth: ""I appreciate the fact that we have a disagreement on that.""We're with Maddow here. This isn't a matter of legal interpretation. The Massachusetts Supreme Court did not define marriage ""simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy."" And when Hayworth inserts the word ""quote,"" the expectation is that he's directly quoting the phrase ""establishment of intimacy"" from the ruling. He's not. The ruling doesn't contain that phrase.Hayworth prefaced his statement by saying he was making an absurd point. We'll give him that. It's absurd, all right. It's also wrong. We give this one a, quote, Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Gov. Rick Perry says his border security efforts led to 60-percent drop in crime along Texas-Mexico border,"At a time when violence along the U.S.-Mexico border is again in the news, Texas Gov. Rick Perry makes an eye-catching claim on his campaign Web site: ""Governor Perry's border security efforts have led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime.""We had lots of questions about that, so we went looking for answers.In 2005, saying the federal government had not done enough to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, Perry announced he was investing in state border security efforts. His plans included helping local law enforcement agencies hire additional officers, buying the agencies equipment, assigning Texas Department of Public Safety personnel to the border and installing surveillance cameras.According to Perry's office, the governor spent about $30 million from his office's budget on the operations in fiscal years 2006-07. The Legislature allocated $110 million for border efforts in 2008-09 and more than $110 million for 2010-11, for a total of $250 million to date.And what was the impact of the efforts?Perry's campaign pointed us to a report from the Texas Border Security Council, whose members were appointed by Perry. According to a chart in the report, ""serious"" crime in the border counties dropped 65 percent in the two-year period between the third quarter of 2005 — when Texas funding for border operations started — and the third quarter of 2007.What's wrong with leaving out the urban areas? More crimes usually occur where more people live.Consider El Paso County. According to DPS data, the sheriff's department there reported 1,350 ""index"" crimes in the county's unincorporated areas in 2005. Adding in offenses reported by the city's police department and other law enforcement agencies in the county causes the ""index"" crimes to total 25,134.Data provided by DPS to support the chart shows that crimes in unincorporated border areas dropped 65 percent between the third quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2007. But that only compares two different quarters. When we looked at crime over all three years of data — 2005 through 2007 -- the decline amounted to less than 1 percent.We also considered the data for both urban and rural areas of all the border counties during those years. The total number of ""index"" or serious crimes rose from 103,884 in 2005 to 103,986 in 2007.The ""index"" crime data omits crimes that may occur at higher rates in border regions, including drug offenses and human trafficking. Without those numbers, the border crime story is incomplete.We asked for that data. The DPS says it doesn't collect it but plans to in the future. Separately, the U.S. Border Control offered information on only two enforcement actions that the agency tracks: the number of foreign nationals caught for being in the United States illegally — what it calls ""apprehensions"" — and the amount of drugs seized. Apprehensions in the Border Patrol sectors that include Texas dropped 58 percent from fiscal 2005 through 2009. The amount of drugs seized — measured in pounds of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and others — more than doubled.Border Patrol spokesman Mark L. Qualia and Tony Payan, an expert on the U.S.-Mexico border and political science professor at the University of Texas-El Paso, agreed that some crimes happen more often in border areas because of the large numbers of people passing through. Qualia cited trespassing and shoplifting as examples of such ""transient"" crimes.Such caveats undermine Perry's claim -- and build a case that border crime is a complicated subject.As for not counting crimes in cities and towns to assess changes in the border region, Payan said: ""This strikes me as sheer manipulation of geographical areas and numbers in order to make the governor look good.""When we asked the governor's office for an explanation of the report's methodology, we were referred to the DPS, whose spokeswoman Tela Mange said: ""We were focusing on the unincorporated areas ... because that is where much of the illegal activity involving human and contraband smuggling occurs.""That may be, though neither the state of Texas nor the Border Patrol gave us data on that activity.Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said that members of his group still believe that crime has gone down and that Perry deserves credit for improving the situation on the border -- though not all the credit. ""Crime has gone down based on cooperation between counties, between the state and between the federal government,"" Reay said.Since 2006, Washington has spent more than $3.7 billion on border security, although Qualia said he could not say exactly how much of the money went to the southwestern or Texas border. Some of the major initiatives have been to hire more Border Patrol agents and build hundreds of miles of fencing.Payan also said that outside factors could have caused border crime to decline. He cited the war raging between drug cartels in Mexico, which he says has limited the cartels' ability to do business across the Rio Grande.Perry's claims about reducing border crime have come under scrutiny before. In 2006, the El Paso Times investigated his statements touting the impact of Operation Rio Grande, which shifted DPS officers and other state resources to border areas. That October, Perry's office trumpeted in a press release: ""Crime down 60 percent across the border.""The Times questioned the statistic, noting it was based on average crime reductions in ""several"" counties -- not the entire border region -- where the state participated in ""surge"" operations over a four-month period. The operations beefed up federal, state and local law enforcement personnel in selected rural areas; urban areas weren't included in the statistics.That's relatively old news.What about more recently? We checked the latest available UCR crime data in both urban and non-incorporated areas along the Texas border in 2008, as reported by the DPS. Overall, serious crime went up 1.6 percent from 2007.Summing up: Perry's claim that his border security efforts have led to a 60 percent drop in crime doesn't hold water. The calculation he touts doesn't consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years' worth of data.Crime may have temporarily subsided in some rural areas of the border region.However, it's not clear how much of any decline can be traced to the state's investment in security.We rate Perry's sweeping statement based on an unreasonable manipulation of crime statistics -- the second instance of his administration touting questionable border crime numbers -- as Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Ad claims if health reform bill passes, government panel could make laws that limit preventive services like mammograms","A new TV ad from Americans for Prosperity, a group opposing the health reform bill, suggests that screening mammograms for women under 50 would be in jeopardy if the bill passes.The ad, running in 18 key congressional districts through March 18, 2010, features an appeal from breast cancer survivor Tracy Walsh of North Augusta, S.C.""I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 43,"" Walsh begins. ""My mother died of cancer. But early detection saved my life. Now a government panel, that didn't include cancer specialists, says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. That saves money, but could cost your life. If I had followed the new government guidelines on mammograms, my cancer would have spread undetected, and my chances of survival would have been reduced. If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases.""There's an awful lot of misinformation and distortion packed into to these few sentences, and we'll have to take them one at a time.But first, some background. In November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued controversial recommendations regarding breast cancer screenings, including one that challenged the long-standing convention that women between the ages of 40 and 50 should get routine mammograms.Specifically, the task force dropped the need for regular mammography screenings for women between 40 and 50 from a Grade B to a Grade C. Grade B means there is ""high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial"" and therefore the screening is recommended. Grade C, however, means that there is ""at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small."" As a result, the task force recommended against routinely providing the screening unless ""other considerations support the offering or providing the service in an individual patient.""Enter the Senate version of the health care bill (which is largely the working bill for now). It would create a health care exchange for people who do not get their insurance through their employer. Among other intended benefits, it would allow people in the so-called individual market to get group rates. Private health insurance companies that wish to compete for business in the exchange would have to offer a minimum package of coverage described in the bill. And among those minimum standards, they'd have to cover the entire cost of ""evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of 'A' or 'B' in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force.""That's the underpinning of the argument from Americans for Prosperity.Now, to unravel some of the distortion.First and foremost, the task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50.Diana Petitti, former vice chair of the task force, said the report has been wildly misrepresented on this point.""The report says that when you hit 40, you should start having conversations with your physician about whether you want to have a mammogram,"" she said. ""There is no reason they shouldn't get a mammogram if they decide to get a mammogram. There is nothing in it that attempts to deny or affect the coverage for mammograms for women aged 40 to 49.""The report found there was insufficient backing to support the idea that routine mammograms should be automatic for all women 40 to 50, but it noted that there were many women for whom they would be appropriate, and that ""the decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms.""Among those who should get routine mammograms under 50? Women with a history of cancer in their family, like Walsh, Petitti said.Dr. Petitti also takes umbrage at Walsh's claim that the panel didn't include cancer specialists. She is the former vice chair of the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board and vice chair of an Institute of Medicine committee that issued a report, ""Beyond Mammography."" Dr. Allen Dietrich is director of Population Sciences at an NCI-designated Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock medical center. And Dr. Sanford Schwartz has also published on the topic of mammography, she noted. In addition, she said, the recommendations were reviewed by oncologists, including a preventive oncologist, and by radiologists.The task force was established to provide an ""independent voice"" and ""sound, evidence-based recommendations for preventive services,"" said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of women's health policy at the independent Kaiser Family Foundation.As for Walsh's comment that not providing mammograms ""saves money, but could cost your life,"" we note that cost-effectiveness was not one of the criteria considered by the task force. It only analyzed the benefits -- early detection of cancer -- against the potential downsides of screening -- mainly stress caused from false-positive test results and the risk of exposure to radiation -- regardless of cost. In short, the panel concluded that based on the evidence, ""For biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years, there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.""Walsh calls the task force recommendation ""new government guidelines on mammograms."" That's also wrong. The task force is an independent panel convened by the government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But their recommendations carry an important disclaimer: ""Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.""In fact, when the task force released its recommendations, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius promptly issued a press release stating, ""There is no question that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations have caused a great deal of confusion and worry among women and their families across this country. I want to address that confusion head on. The U.S. Preventive Task Force is an outside independent panel of doctors and scientists who make recommendations. They do not set federal policy and they don't determine what services are covered by the federal government.""There has been debate in this country for years about the age at which routine screening mammograms should begin, and how often they should be given. The Task Force has presented some new evidence for consideration, but our policies remain unchanged. Indeed, I would be very surprised if any private insurance company changed its mammography coverage decisions as a result of this action.""Health and Human Services guidelines regarding mammograms did not change. Medicaid still covers the full cost of mammograms for women over 40.And Sebelius was correct that it did not affect private insurance companies' policies regarding mammography coverage.""Our providers continue to provide coverage (of breast cancer screenings) when that is a decision reached between the doctor and patient (even when they are under 50),"" said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans.She said she ""doesn't have any reason to believe the health bill is going to change"" their policy. ""Quite the opposite,"" Pisano said, ""we even do outreach to encourage women to do screenings. We will continue to focus on screenings and prevention. That's something we very much believe in.""But back to the Senate bill.There are a few other reasons that Walsh's claims about its limits of mammography are misleading. For one, the bill talks about minimum requirements for policies offered on the exchange.""That's the floor in terms of preventive benefits,"" said Salganicoff, of Kaiser. ""Furthermore, there is nothing that stops anyone from covering diagnostic mammograms for women of any age.""The Senate bill makes it clear that plans may offer services well beyond the minimum requirements, including mammograms or any other services.""Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in addition to those recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for services that are not recommended by such Task Force,"" the bill states.And if all that weren't enough, legislators went out of their way to ensure that mammograms for women aged 40 to 50 would be covered.Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., added an amendment that requires, when it comes to no-cost preventive services offered to women on the exchange, in addition to the services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, they also must include services ""provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration."" And those HHS guidelines say you've got to cover mammograms for women over 40.Asked in an interview with National Public Radio whether task-force studies like the breast cancer recommendations would be the basis for restricting coverage on the health care exchange, Sebelius said it is the secretary of health and human services — not the advisory panels — who would be have final say on what must be covered.According to NPR, ""Asked whether she would be willing to pledge that as long as she remains secretary of health and human services, she will make sure that every plan offered on the exchange will give coverage for annual mammograms for women over 40, Sebelius responded: 'Well, yes. I think that is an important service. It's a determination that we've made.'""Sen. David Vitter, R-La., offered an amendment (which passed) that made it even clearer. ""For the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any other provision of law, the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009.""In other words, ignore the November task force ruling altogether.Phil Kerpen, vice president of policy at Americans for Prosperity (which spent $750,000 on the ad) called that a ""temporary fix"" and said ""if the task force upholds that again in its next recommendations (as expected) that will no longer be operative.""How worried is the American Cancer Society that Kerpen's scenario might lead to insurers not covering mammograms for women under 50? Not at all.""We're comfortable with the final language and that women 40 and above will continue to have access to mammograms as appropriate,"" said Stephen Finan, senior director of policy at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.The HHS guidelines include mammograms for women over 40, he noted, so ""as of now, if everything in the plan today was law, women over 40 would continue to be covered by their insurance.""In addition, he noted, 49 states have laws that require mammograms to be covered. The rules vary from state to state, but most require private insurers to pay 100 percent of the cost of mammograms for women over 40.""The fact is, most group plans today provide it anyway as essential, good preventive service,"" Finan said. The number of plans that don't cover it is very small, he said, and is relegated to ""junk plans.""One last point: Without any context provided, Walsh's comments leave the impression this issue applies to all Americans. It doesn't. As Kerpen confirmed, she's talking only about people who participate in the health insurance exchange, not people who get their insurance through their employer. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that if the health bill passes, four out of five people would continue to get their insurance through their employer. Walsh was covered through her husband's employer, so this whole issue doesn't even apply to her.To review: The task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. The task force did include experts on cancer screening. It did not factor in cost. The recommendations are not the new government guidelines (in fact, the government guidelines remained the same).In short, this is a bogus issue. If the bill passes, preventive services recommended by the task force would become the bare minimum insurance companies in the exchange would be required to cover. And with regard to mammograms, specifically, they would be covered for women over 40.Americans for Prosperity got the wrong messenger. With a mother who died of cancer, Walsh is practically a poster child for the kind of person who the task force believes ought to get a mammogram before 50. And she gets her insurance through her husband's insurance. Nothing in the health care bill would change how she (or the four out of five Americans like her) would have received care through employer insurance. More importantly, Americans for Prosperity seized on an issue -- free mammograms for women between 40 and 50 -- that was specifically taken care of with not one, but two, Senate amendments. We rule this claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,"Cathie Adams says Bill White supports ""ObamaCare socialized medicine plan"" and cap-and-trade","We conclude our trifecta of Truth-O-Meter rulings on a February fund-raising letter sent by Texas GOP chair Cathie Adams. She levelled six charges against Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White including these pops: ""He supports the ‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan, as well as ‘Cap and Trade’ legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs.""Socialist? Job-killer? We decided to test the politically potent charges. (We deal with the rest of Adams' letter in separate Truth-O-Meter items.)On Adams’ claim that White supports the ""‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan,"" the Republican Party initially referred us to an August article in the El Paso Times. The story makes no reference to ""Obamacare"" or ""socialized medicine."" Instead it quotes White saying he backs President Barack Obama’s goals of allowing people to keep their current doctors and insurance plans and expanding the availability of health coverage while containing costs.Last week, White said he's never endorsed a cap-and-trade proposal, preferring approaches that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging utilities to use more natural gas and renewable energy. ""The closer somebody comes to that approach, the more I support it,"" White said.White also has called for Texas to follow states including California, New York and Massachusetts in adopting state-level low-emission vehicle standards so that ""we help drive down the cost of more fuel-efficient, lower-emission vehicles for all people in our country. Texas is the biggest state not to have adopted these standards. And I think the auto makers will see the writing on the wall if we do so.""Any politico can appreciate why Republicans want to portray White as favoring ""socialized medicine"" and cap-and-trade legislation critics say would slam the state's economy.But in the absence of confirming facts, these sizzlers read like ridiculous smears.We rate Adams' statement Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,"Rangel says ethics report ""exonerates"" him","Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has been under investigation for eight months, accused of violating congressional gift rules by letting corporations pay for Caribbean trips in 2007 and 2008.""I'm glad for the wording of it because clearly the wording exonerates me,"" Rangel said.What?The ethics report found that Rangel's aides tried at least three times -- twice in memos and once in a letter to him -- to show him that his Caribbean trips had corporate sponsors, but he denied seeing any of them. And he says his staff never told him about them. The ethics committee concluded there was no evidence that he did see the correspondences sent to him. But the report did not clear him of responsibility.Here's what the letter accompanying the ethics report states:""The Report further finds that Representative Charles B. Rangel violated the House gift rule by accepting payment or reimbursement for travel to the 2007 and 2008 conferences. The evidence shows that members of Representative Rangel's staff knew that corporations had contributed funds to Carib News specifically for the 2007 and 2008 conferences. This information was not provided to the Standards Committee when he sought and received approval from the Committee to accept these trips. The Committee does not find sufficient evidence to conclude, nor does it believe that it would discover additional evidence to alter its conclusion, that Representative Rangel had actual knowledge of the memoranda written by his staff. However, the report finds that Representative Rangel was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties. It is the intention of the Committee that the publication of this Report will serve as a public admonishment by the Standards Committee of Representative Rangel. The Committee will also require Representative Rangel to repay the costs of the trips to the respective entities that paid for his travel.""Rangel argues that the report did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that he had direct knowledge of the corporate sponsorship of his travel, so that means he was ""exonerated.""""Members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoings or mistakes or errors of staff,"" Rangel said.The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines ""exonerate"" as: ""to relieve of a responsibility, obligation, or hardship; to clear from accusation or blame.""The ethics report did not do that. In fact, the report found that Rangel ""was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff."" And the report included a ""public admonishment"" of Rangel.The ethics panel did exonerate five other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who went on the same trips, multinational business conferences held in Antigua and Barbuda in November 2007 and St. Maarten in November 2008. The report concluded that their respective staff members didn't know about the corporations paying for the trips, so the members of Congress did not knowingly violate any rules and committed no wrongdoing because they were ""provided false information by others, and relied upon that information in seeking approval to accept the trips."" Nonetheless, the report states, the trips were ""impermissible gifts,"" and they must repay the cost of the travel.At a news briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Rangel is entitled to ""have his day"" before the ethics committee on those allegations.""They (the ethics committee members) have said he did not knowingly violate the rules,"" Pelosi said. ""And again, if this were the end of it, that would be one thing, but there's obviously more to come, and we'll see what happens with that. But every member has that right.""I think it's quite a statement to hold members accountable for what their staffs knew,"" Pelosi said. ""I would be interested to see how that reverberates. But we have to place our confidence appropriately, and we’re held responsible for that.""You can agree with the ethics panel ruling or not, but the fact is it found that even if Rangel had no direct knowledge of the staff memos warning him about corporate sponsorship, Rangel ""was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties."" There's just no way to spin that into ""exoneration."" To the contrary, the ethics report included a public admonishment of Rangel. And so we rule Rangel's comment Pants on Fire!"

And more importantly, that's not what Giuliani said on national television.Here's how Giuliani tried to clarify the issue during an interview later that day with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""This is so silly,"" Giuliani said. ""What I usually say when I say that, I usually say we had no major domestic attacks under President Bush since Sept. 11. I did omit the words 'since Sept. 11.' I apologize for that."" Giuliani went on to say it's not clear if the anthrax attacks were perpetuated by Islamic fundamentalists.We're not sure if Giuliani's claim that Obama has had only one domestic attack in his first year as president is right, either. Besides the Christmas Day bombing attempt, several U.S. lawmakers have already labeled the November Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism.The Giuliani spokesman, whom ABC News did not identify, said the ""one"" attack that Giuliani says took place during the Obama administration was a reference to the alleged Fort Hood shooter, Maj. Nidal Hasan. (Again, excluding the Christmas Day bombing plot by using the ""on our soil"" addendum.)Giuliani ran a presidential campaign based on the leadership he showed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. We would expect him to at least acknowledge that those attacks occurred while George W. Bush was president. But even considering that he was talking post-9/11, Giuliani is just plain wrong to suggest no terrorist attacks happened under Bush's watch. The clarifications added by a Giuliani spokesman are threaded so thin, it sounds like damage control more than anything. We say Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Cheney says Obama won't admit the U.S. at war against terrorists,"In his latest attack on President Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney seized on the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound jetliner to suggest that Obama is weak on terrorism.But a review of Obama's statements of the past year makes it clear he has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations."
PANTS-FIRE,Glenn Beck claims health care bill includes insurance for dogs,"We're months into this health care debate and frankly a lot of the claims we've been fact-checking from opponents and proponents alike have gotten a little stale. So we were thrilled to hear a new one on the Glenn Beck radio program on Nov. 12, 2009:""Do you know in the health care bill, we're now offering insurance for dogs,"" Beck said. ""Do I need to say any more?""Actually yes. Keep going.""If you are somebody who is like, 'Well, I just, I'm struggling and we're barely making ends meet,' I'm not paying for your dog cardiologist!"" Beck said. ""Not gonna do it. I'm sorry, the dog goes nighty night.""There was some discussion between Beck and his executive producer about their own dogs' medical issues, whether or not they have pet insurance, and whether the Obama administration is putting animals on par with humans.Like so many claims in the health care debate, Beck has taken a kernel of something in the bill and spun it to an absurd conclusion.Included in the House bill is the creation of a Public Health Workforce Corps to address shortages in the public health workforce. The program would provide scholarships and education loan repayment assistance for public health professionals serving in areas of need. Veterinarians are included among those public health professionals.""The rationale is that with mad cow disease, swine flu and other animal-borne diseases and issues, there is logic in helping to create more and better trained individuals to treat animal health,"" said Vincent Morris, spokesman for the House Rules Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.But the inclusion of veterinarians in the health bill didn't sit well with Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., who noted on the House floor on Nov. 7, 2009, that the loan repayment program will cost $283 million over five years.""So the real question I have for you folks (Democrats): Why are veterinarians part of this health care bill?"" Stearns asked.Rep. Slaughter responded: ""Have you ever heard of swine flu? Have you ever heard about food safety? Have you ever heard that 70 percent of all of the antibiotics produced in the United States are given to cattle and poultry even though they are not ill? But swine flu should make you worry a little bit, don’t you think?""The bill also would provide funding for fellowships to support public health training, and again, veterinary medicine is included in the mix. Lastly, the bill would create an advisory committee to assess the health workforce and to make recommendations to ensure that workforce is meeting the nation’s needs. The bill says that would include public health professions ""including veterinarians engaged in public health practice."" In other words, not the local vet who gives your dog heartworm pills.Two other things about the scholarships and loan assistance programs. In order to qualify, the bill says applicants must ""have demonstrated expertise in public health"" and as quid pro quo must serve for a period equal to their scholarship in a public health program assigned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Again, not your pet vet down the street.""Veterinarians are a part of the public health workforce, especially those that deal with disease outbreak,"" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. ""We have a shortage of veterinarians right now who are trained to deal with disease outbreak.""Still, scholarships, loan assistance and fellowships to veterinarians is one thing. Providing government health insurance to dogs is quite another.""We are not offering insurance for dogs,"" Morris said.We pored over the bill and came to the same conclusion. There is no health insurance of any kind for dogs -- no public option for Rex, no death panels for Fido.So we've got to put Beck in the doghouse for this one -- Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Charlie Crist says he didn't endorse stimulus bill,"Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, facing a potentially bruising Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, continues to run from any assertion that he is linked to President Barack Obama.Last week Crist told reporters he didn't know Obama was traveling in Florida. On Wednesday, Crist told a national television audience he didn't endorse the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by Obama and passed by Congress in February.""I didn't endorse it,"" Crist told CNN host Wolf Blitzer. ""I — you know, I didn't even have a vote on the darned thing. But I understood that it was going to pass and I wanted to be able to utilize it for the benefit of my fellow Floridians.""This, from the same man who skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting to campaign with Obama for the stimulus in Fort Myers in February? Who went on national talk shows and across the state selling the plan?As the interview continued, Crist got on a roll.Crist's comments about the stimulus startled conservatives, Democrats, and frankly, us, who all remember things differently.Let's go back to earlier this year, to see what Crist had to say then.Crist: ""It's not a matter of bucking the party, it's a matter of helping the people. I mean, I really view it as an issue of what can I do that's best for the people of Florida? We've got almost 20 million people that live in the Sunshine State now. I think my obligation is in essence the CEO of the state, to do everything I can to help us get through this tough economy. Certainly this stimulus package, about $12.2 billion to Florida, will help Florida an awful lot.""In fact, he was one of the few prominent Republicans to support the stimulus at any level, a choice that won him accolades from Obama.On Thursday, Crist tried to expand on his CNN comments. When asked by state Capitol reporters if he were changing his position on the stimulus, Crist said, ""I don't think so. I don't think so.""""The bill that passed wasn't exactly what I would want to vote for. But it's what passed,"" Crist said. ""And once that happened, you need to realize you need to do everything you possibly can to fight for Florida and our fellow Floridians, whether they're school teachers, construction workers or whatever it might be. And so once this happens, you know, I think it's important to embrace it, fight for Florida's fair share and do what's right for the state.""Back to Crist's original statement. He said Wednesday that he didn't endorse the stimulus and offered the fact that he didn't have a vote on the proposal as evidence.Of course, Crist, as governor, couldn't vote for the stimulus. But, strictly speaking, neither could Obama as president. So that's hardly a proper measure to justify a claim that Crist didn't endorse the stimulus bill.What is a proper measure are Crist's actions in January and February. Crist broke ranks with many in the Republican Party by publicly campaigning for the stimulus package on television and with the president. He lobbied Florida's congressional delegation to vote for the bill. And he signed Florida's budget, which was balanced because the state received billions of dollars in federal stimulus money. (The stimulus provides Florida $15.7 billion over three budget years ending next budget year.)White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on Thursday even acknowledged Crist's support. ""I think his words at that (Fort Myers) event speak for themselves,"" Gibbs said. ""I think he was very supportive of the legislation and supportive of the benefits that it would have and has had for — for the state of Florida in seeing positive economic growth.""Facing a primary challenge from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Crist appears to be trying to rewrite history. But there are mountains of evidence that he not only supported the stimulus, he sang its praises. The meter is ablaze: Pants On Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,E-mail claims Democratic Congress to blame for no COLA increase in Social Security,"So every year you've gotten a little bump in your Social Security check due to inflation. Maybe you've come to consider it an annual raise from Uncle Sam.Well, this January, you might not get one.And a chain e-mail making the rounds tells you to blame Democrats in Congress.""For the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the Social Security COLA (cost of living adjustment),"" the e-mail states.There are actually two versions of this e-mail floating around. One pins the blame generically on ""Congress,"" while the other says ""the Democratic Congress."" The second version seems to have gotten more traction on the Web, so we focused on the latter version.""It has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans,"" said Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for Social Security. ""It's been the law since 1975, and it's based strictly on the numbers.""Congress could vote to increase Social Security payments even though the COLA formula doesn't call for it. And, in fact, several pieces of legislation have been offered with that very goal.One is the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, introduced in the Senate by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and in the House by Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. It would provide a one-time payment of $250 to Social Security recipients next year.Another is the Emergency COLA Bill, introduced earlier this week by Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C. It would provide a COLA for 2010 equal to the average of the COLA over the past 10 years — roughly 3 percent.Obviously, these bills are coming from both sides of the aisle.If this e-mail had merely gotten some facts wrong, we'd be comfortable rating it False. But given that it targets senior citizens on an important pocketbook issue with an incorrect allegation that has no basis in fact, we have to go one more notch and set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire."
PANTS-FIRE,Health Choices Commissioner does not decide your health benefits,"It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: ""Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services.""One of the claims that is just plain wrong says this: ""Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None.""To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat.People who don't get insurance through work or another group will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service.""This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform.The exchange is meant to ensure that people are ""actually getting coverage and not a junk policy,"" Tolbert added.A key point here is that employer-provided insurance is already subject to this kind of regulation. Employer-provided insurance has to meet certain requirements to win its tax-exempt status.That's why, if you get insurance through work, you're not asked about pre-existing conditions, and you pay the same rate as all of your co-workers.The bill says that a Health Choices commissioner will run the exchange, and that he or she will make sure that insurers are offering basic benefits and adhering to the regulations. Individuals then choose their own plan from offerings on the exchange. The health commissioner does not ""decide health benefits for you."" To the extent that insurance plans have to meet basic requirements, those instructions are ultimately coming from Congress. The commissioner executes the rules.The chain e-mail mentions page 42, which is part of Section 142. That section outlines the duties of the Health Choices commissioner and explains that the commissioner should seek insurers to offer different types of insurance, including basic, enhanced and premium. Again, individuals will be able to choose among competing insurers that are regulated via the exchange.The e-mail is adamant that the Health Choices commissioner ""will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None."" That is not what the bill says. The bill envisions an exchange with several different plans, and people choosing their own plan. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Glenn Beck claims science czar John Holdren proposed forced abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population,"As evidence that the country is closer to socialist than capitalist these days, radio and talk show host Glenn Beck recently made this claim about John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy:""I mean, we've got czars now,"" Beck said during his July 22, 2009, program. ""Czars like John Holdren, who has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population.""Political figures like Holdren, who are little-known by most Americans, make easy targets. And Beck's biting quick hit on Holdren provides a healthy enough dose of outrage on which to hang his argument.But is it true?Conservative bloggers have quoted the book extensively, and often out of context, to make the point that Holdren has advocated positions such as the ones Beck stated.We obtained the book to see exactly what Holdren, then a young man, wrote (or co-wrote). The book is just over 1,000 pages, and it clearly makes that case that an explosion in population presented a grave crisis. Although it is a textbook, the authors don't shy away from presenting a point of view. As the preface states, ""We have tried throughout the book to state clearly where we stand on various matters of controversy.""In a section on ""Involuntary Fertility Control,"" Holdren and the other authors discuss various ""coercive"" means of population control — including putting sterilants in the drinking water. But they stop well short of advocating such measures.Here's a few excerpts:And here's the part that some have interpreted as Holdren advocating for forced abortions.""To date, there has been no serious attempt in Western countries to use laws to control excessive population growth, although there exists ample authority under which population growth could be regulated. For example, under the United States Constitution, effective population-control programs could be enacted under the clauses that empower Congress to appropriate funds to provide for the general welfare and to regulate commerce, or under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such laws constitutionally could be very broad. Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society. Few today consider the situation in the United States serious enough to justify compulsion, however.""This comes in a section discussing population law. The authors argue that compulsory abortions could potentially be allowed under U.S. law ""if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society."" Again, that's a far cry from advocating or proposing such a position.In the book, the authors certainly advocate making abortions readily accessible for women who want to get them. But they never advocate forced abortions. Big difference.In response to the comments from Beck and others, Holdren's office issued this statement: ""The quotations used to suggest that Dr. Holdren supports coercive approaches to limiting population growth were taken from a 1977 college textbook on environmental science and policy, of which he was the third author.  The quoted material was from a section of the book that described different possible approaches to limiting population growth and then concluded that the authors’ own preference was to employ the noncoercive approaches before the environmental and social impacts of overpopulation led desperate societies to employ coercive ones.  Dr. Holdren has never been an advocate of compulsory abortions or other repressive means of population limitation.""Holdren's office also provided a statement from Annie and Paul Ehrlich, the co-authors: ""We have been shocked at the serious mischaracterization of our views and those of John Holdren in blog posts based on misreadings of our jointly-authored 1000-page 1977 textbook, ECOSCIENCE.  We were not then,  never have been, and are not now 'advocates' of the Draconian measures for population limitation described — but not recommended — in the book's 60-plus small-type pages cataloging the full spectrum of population policies that, at the time, had either been tried in some country or analyzed by some commentator.Under questioning by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., during his Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he ""no longer thinks it's productive to focus on optimum population for the United States. ... I think the key thing today is that we need to work to improve the conditions that all of our citizens face economically, environmentally, and in other respects. And we need to aim for something that I have for years been calling 'sustainable prosperity.'""But with regard to Beck's claim that Holdren ""has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population,"" the text of the book clearly does not support that. We think a thorough reading shows that these were ideas presented as approaches that had been discussed. They were not posed as suggestions or proposals. In fact, the authors make clear that they did not support coercive means of population control. Certainly, nowhere in the book do the authors advocate for forced abortions.Some have argued that Holdren's view of the imminent and grave global dangers posed by overpopulation should provide pause, given Holdren's current view that global warming now presents imminent and grave global dangers. That's a matter for reasoned debate.  But in seeking to score points for a political argument, Beck seriously mischaracterizes Holdren's positions. Holdren didn't advocate those ideas then. And, when asked at a Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he did not support them now. We think it's irresponsible to pluck a few lines from a 1,000-page, 30-year-old textbook, and then present them out of context to dismiss Holdren's long and distinguished career. And we rate Beck's claim Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Stimulus bill won't change status of Sunday school,"In a fundraising e-mail, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that President Barack Obama is anti-Christian.""In fact, buried inside Obama's trillion-dollar stimulus package is anti-Christian legislation that will stop churches from using public schools for meeting on Sundays, as well as Boy Scouts and student Bible study groups,"" Gingrich wrote.The e-mail is part of Gingrich's fundraising efforts for an organization called Renewing American Leadership, which will ""bring moral leadership back to our nation.""Back in February, before the stimulus had passed, we checked out a claim from Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina that the language would stop students from having prayer groups or Bible studies in their dorms. We found that it wouldn't. The courts have been clear that religious groups are entitled to the same equal access to public facilities as any other group. While someone might conceivably file a lawsuit against prayer groups or Bible studies in dorms, those lawsuits would fail, according to all the experts we consulted.Howard Simon of the ACLU said it was preposterous to claim that the ACLU would sue if students in a dorm want to share their faith or organize a Bible study, even if that dorm was renovated with federal funds.""On what basis would there be a lawsuit? There is a First Amendment in our country. People have a constitutional right to state their faith.""Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the language in the stimulus plan amounts to little more than boilerplate for federal legislation, similar to language used for decades in the Higher Education Facilities Act. It is simply designed, he said, to ensure that federal money isn't used to build churches and other religious facilities. But that doesn't mean religious groups can't use university facilities.The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that religious groups have as much right to equal access to public facilities as anyone else. For example, in 2001, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children, which had been barred from using a public school for weekly afterschool meetings.Back when the stimulus was still being debated, Robert Alt, deputy director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that the language in the stimulus bill was written too broadly. Yes, he said, the Supreme Court has made clear what the law is on all this, so why add the language at all? The provision, as written, ""would seem to permit a legal challenge"" to all sorts of religious activity on college campuses in buildings renovated with federal funds, he said.Given the Supreme Court's decisions, though, wouldn't those challenges fail?""The Supreme Court precedent is perfectly clear,"" Alt said. ""I think they would lose.""The new aspect of Gingrich's claim is that the stimulus language would affect church groups that meet in public schools, and that the Boy Scouts would be considered an excluded religious group. Rick Tyler, founding director of Renewing American Leadership and a spokesman for Gingrich, said in an e-mail that these concerns were based on the same provision that DeMint was concerned about.But we find that's not plausible because the stimulus clause refers specifically to money for higher education, not elementary and secondary schools as Gingrich's comment about ""public schools"" suggests.And Gingrich's claim is ridiculously false because court rulings have consistently said that religious groups have the same equal access rights for the public schools.""The law is fairly settled,"" said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Her group opposes allowing church groups to meet in public schools, but it is legal, she said.The stimulus bill uses ""boilerplate language,"" she said. ""That's not going to override two Supreme Court cases.""We found little support for DeMint's claim back in February that the provision would mean that students couldn't meet in dorm rooms for Bible study. Gingrich's claim is even more ridiculous to suggest the Boy Scouts would be among those banned from public schools.In short, we haven't seen anything that supports Gingrich's claim that the stimulus will stop church groups from meeting at public schools, nor Boy Scouts or Bible study groups. In fact, the clause on religion does not even apply to public schools. Inasmuch as this one seems aimed at unnecessarily inflaming the conservative Christian base, we'd like to retort with some flames of our own. We rate Gingrich's claim Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c368a99-5e22-48ad-8225-26b2da181df4"
PANTS-FIRE,Biden wrong on the way germs travel through an aircraft,"Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began.""We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move,"" Biden told Lauer.Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, ""Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ..."" — Biden laughs here — ""No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?""Biden: ""I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing.""Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement:We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin.The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true.""Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,"" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. ""The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.""We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment.The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration.Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system.The particles from a sneeze ""might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,"" Overfelt said. ""They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.""""Quite a bit of research indicates that,"" he added.And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said.We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point:• A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to ""a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.""That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes.This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to — you guessed it — rubbing your eyes.""If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,"" Overfelt said. ""With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane.""If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was ""When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft."" That's just wrong. And he made the statement in the context of a highly sensitive public health matter where it's important to give the public accurate information. For fanning the flames of fear without having the facts on his side, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,Steele says government has never created a job. We conclude the opposite.,"Michael Steele, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, recently won a contest to lead the Republican National Committee. He also made history as the first African-American to lead the party.One of Steele's first appearances was before a retreat for House Republicans on Jan. 31, 2009.Steele praised the House Republicans for voting as a block against the stimulus package promoted by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Then he said that the stimulus was pointless, because government can't create jobs.Crist (recorded earlier): ""This program will help us with education, with health care, Medicaid specifically, infrastructure. These are the kinds of things that produce jobs. It could mean $13 billion to the Sunshine State. It comes at a time when we need it. People need jobs. It's about jobs, jobs, jobs.""Stephanopolous (to Steele): ""He suggests that you and Republican Party leaders here in Washington are on the wrong side of the biggest issue, jobs.""Steele: ""Well, no — you know, with all due respect to the governor, I understand where he's coming from. Having been a state official, I know what it means to get those dollars when you're in tight times. But you've got to look at the entire package. You've got to look at what's going to create sustainable jobs. What this administration is talking about is making work. It is creating work.""Stephanopoulos: ""But that's a job.""Steele: ""No, it's not a job. A job is something that a business owner creates. It's going to be long term.""Stephanopoulos: ""So a job doesn't count if it's a government job?""Steele: ""Hold on. No, let me finish. That is a contract. It ends at a certain point, George. You know that. These road projects that we're talking about have an end point. As a small-business owner, I'm looking to grow my business, expand my business. I want to reach further. I want to be international. I want to be national. It's a whole different perspective on how you create a job versus how you create work.""Stephanopoulos: ""I guess I don't really understand that distinction.""So we started looking for evidence that the government creates jobs. It wasn't hard to find.The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the federal government is the nation's largest employer, with more than 1.8 million employees, excluding the post office.""Competition is expected for many federal positions, especially during times of economic uncertainty, when workers seek the stability of federal employment,"" says a report posted on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site. ""In general, federal employment is considered to be relatively stable because it is not affected by cyclical fluctuations in the economy, as are employment levels in many private sector industries.""At USAJobs.com, you can look for a job with the federal government. On the day we looked, the Web site said, ""There are 37,409 U.S. government job opportunities worldwide,"" and invited applicants to seek by job title, keyword, city, state or zip code.We looked at lists of largest employers published by local chambers of commerce and found many local government entities listed. We randomly selected Durham, N.C., for example, and found that the chamber in 2007 listed the public schools as the third largest employer with 5,489 workers. The city of Durham was seventh largest employer with 2,336 jobs. The Veterans Administration Medical Center as ninth with 2,162 jobs, and ... well, we'll stop there.Perhaps in his mind Steele was trying to make a point that private sector jobs are superior to public sector jobs. But that's not what he said. He said that ""government — federal, state or local — has never created one job."" Then, in the interview with Stephanopoulos, he implied that only businesses can create jobs, not government.Steele may not like government jobs, but he can't wish them away. For trying to pretend that government jobs don't exist, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!"
PANTS-FIRE,'Not a cent' from unrelated Obama,"A chain e-mail that originates with a letter from American missionaries working in Kenya warns about Sen. Barack Obama's ties to Kenya and its opposition party, encouraging readers ""not to be taken in by those that are promoting him.""Among the many allegations is one about Obama's ties to Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga: ""Obama under 'friends of Obama' gave almost a million dollars to the (Kenya) opposition campaign who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga, who is a socialist trained in East Germany.""But even with the credibility of a real author, the claims in this e-mail are as baseless as anything you've read from an anonymous blogger.Celeste Davis wrote the letter. Her husband, Loren Davis, spoke to PolitiFact at length about its many allegations.He says they've lived and worked in Kenya for the past 12 years and this was a personal letter ""never intended to be forwarded or sent out to the Web.""""It's totally caught us by surprise,"" Loren Davis said. He went on to back up the claims and provide some evidence.Let's examine this one in two parts:• ""Obama under 'friends of Obama' gave almost a million dollars to the (Kenya) opposition campaign.""Loren Davis provided PolitiFact with a document that he says shows Obama gave $1-million to the Kenyan opposition campaign led by Odinga. A header at the top of the page says it's a ""consolidated statement of campaign financial activities."" Under the header is a list of ""incoming resources"" with entries listed in columns of ""from"" and ""amount.""Handwritten notes amplify the point being made. A name on the list is underlined and the words ""Barak Obama"" are written in the margin, suggesting that donation is from the Illinois senator, even though his name is misspelled. The amount across from this name also is underlined and next to it someone has written ""$1 million,"" implying Obama contributed $1-million.The Obama campaign strongly disputes this allegation and three Kenya experts who reviewed the document at our request called it fraudulent. The Obama campaign sent PolitiFact the same document and one other purporting to show Obama's campaign contributions to Kenya. The first they heard of it was when these documents arrived by fax.On the legible version, you can see the underlined entry says, ""Friends of Senator BO,"" presumably Barack Obama. Only, there is no political action committee named Friends of Senator BO or Friends of Barack Obama. So says Obama's campaign. And a search of the Federal Election Commission Web site and Opensecrets.org, the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics, pulls up neither. In fact, there's no PAC name even close.Not to mention, the Obama campaign says the senator never gave money to Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga. And Salim Lone, spokesman for Odinga whom we spoke with in Kenya, confirms that.""That is absolutely ridiculous,"" Lone said in an interview with PolitiFact. ""Mr. Obama did not donate a single cent to Mr. Odinga's campaign.""Just to be certain, we did an analysis of Federal Election Commission reports of disbursements from Obama's principal presidential campaign committee, Obama for America, during the 2008 election cycle. We searched for ""Kenya,"" ""Odinga"" and ""ODM,"" (the Orange Democratic Movement) the latter being Odinga's political party, and came up with no matches.And what about the second part of the quote?• ""Who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga, who is a socialist trained in East Germany.""Odinga: ""Barack Obama's father is my maternal uncle.""BBC: ""You're related to him?""Odinga: ""Yes, I am.""No, you're not, says the Obama campaign.We spoke to three Kenya experts who dismiss this part of the claim as well, suggesting Odinga made the connection to give himself more legitimacy during the political crisis.""It's stretched to the point of ridiculousness,"" said Joel D. Barkan, political science professor emeritus at the University of Iowa and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. ""To my knowledge, they are not first cousins in the normal sense. To my knowledge, there's absolutely no relationship at all.""Alex Awiti, a Kenyan postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University, says you have to consider the context of when Odinga was speaking, that being in the middle of a political crisis.""Raila Odinga was groping all over the place, trying to find some political legitimacy to get on a high pedestal to claim leadership and using Obama was basically going to add some political points,"" said Awiti, who lived in Kenya until three years ago. ""This is very opportunistic and it should be totally disregarded.""Lone, Odinga's spokesman, said cousins in the African sense is very different from cousins in the American sense, so they might be distant relatives.But again, our Kenya experts say that doesn't make him a socialist.A nugget of truth in a mountain of wholesale inaccuracy does nothing to diminish our ruling on this irresponsible claim. Neither does the fact the American author says it wasn't meant for worldwide distribution. This is Pants on Fire wrong. "
PANTS-FIRE,"Video shows tarmac welcome, no snipers","(Published March 25, 2008)During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996.""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.""Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. ""There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,"" she said.""Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.'""There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. Yes, Clinton later acknowledged that she was mistaken, but it's hard to understand how she could err on something so significant as whether she did or didn't dodge sniper bullets. Quite simply, this kind of hyperbole deserves our harshest assessment. We rule Pants on Fire. "
PANTS-FIRE,'Songbird John' McCain? No evidence McCain helped enemy in Vietnam,"In an echo of the attacks from the 2000 South Carolina primary that dealt a critical blow to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, a new flyer says the Arizona senator is a traitor.It says that when he was a POW, McCain was a ""Hanoi Hilton songbird"" who collaborated with the enemy.But it provides scant evidence to back up this claim and it is strongly contradicted by many other accounts reviewed by PolitiFact: interviews with other POWs, an author who has written a McCain biography and the senator's own accounts.The flyer has a caricature of a surly-looking McCain in a prison cell under the words, ""Hanoi Hilton Songbird."" The second page is headlined ""FACT SHEET: Military Record of John Sidney McCain III"" and it begins with some accurate biographical information.The flyer contains 1 pages of criticisms of McCain, but only a few support the accusation that he was helping the enemy:• That he told his captors ""Okay, I'll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital.""• That the Hanoi news media reported he had given information about his flight, rescue ships and the order of U.S. attacks.• That he broke the military code because he answered questions from a Spanish psychiatrist who had apparently been cooperating with the North Vietnamese.There is some truth to these claims, but collectively they do not prove McCain was involved in ""collaborations with the enemy,"" as the flyer alleges.When he was later interrogated, McCain gave his ship's name and squadron number and confirmed the target of his failed mission, he wrote. He also gave the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line and said they were members of his squadron.Asked to identify future targets, he mentioned North Vietnamese cities that U.S. planes had already bombed.George ""Bud"" Day and Orson Swindle, fellow POWs, told PolitiFact that POWs sometimes were forced to talk when they were tortured, but they tried to tell lies to mislead their captors.""We were all tortured and we wrote confessions under the pressure of torture,"" said Swindle, who was a cellmate with McCain and is active in his campaign. ""John McCain never collaborated with the enemy. He, like every one of us, submitted to severe torture. John McCain did nothing dishonorable. He was heroic.""At one point, McCain broke down and signed a confession. But Timberg, the biographer, said McCain deliberately used misspellings, grammatical errors and Communist jargon to show he was writing under duress: ""I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life . . . ""Day, a Medal of Honor winner who also is supporting McCain's campaign, said the flyer is ""the most outrageous f------ lie I've ever heard.""The man behind the flyer is Gerard ""Jerry"" W. Kiley, 61, of Garnerville, N.Y., who says he served in Vietnam for about a year. He describes his group as a one-man operation unaffiliated with any political party or campaign. He says he opposes McCain because of the senator's efforts to normalize relations with the Vietnamese communist government and because, in his view, McCain has helped the U.S. government keep information about POWs classified.""John McCain has made sure the information concerning the lives of Americans we clearly abandoned after the war remain in government files 40 years later,"" he says.He teamed with political activist Ted Sampley of North Carolina to distribute the fliers to South Carolina media outlets this month. Sampley did not respond to requests for comment.McCain is not the first politician to draw the men's ire. In 2004, they formed Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry.Kiley has twice interrupted events featuring Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, forcing an American flag in his hand on one occasion and throwing red wine at him on another, according to a Secret Service agent who later arrested Kiley. He admits he threw the wine, but he was later acquitted in federal court of threatening Khai.Kiley says he bases his most damning charges against McCain — that McCain gave information about the schedule of U.S. attacks in Vietnam in 1967, the year his plane was shot down and McCain was captured — on the word of Earl Hopper, a retired Army colonel.In an interview, Hopper's wife, Patty, said that Hopper wasn't able to address the charges over the phone because of poor hearing. She said that Hopper has long been involved in the POW movement and that Earl Hopper's son, Earl Jr., is missing in action in Vietnam.But the 1973 article does not back up the charges made in the flyer. It provides the same basic account as McCain's book, corroborated by Timberg's book, which was based on interviews with many POWs.Timberg, Day and Swindle noted that McCain, the son of a Navy admiral, was offered an early release from the prison but refused so that he could adhere to the military's code of conduct.Timberg said he was perplexed by the allegations.""Why do they hate him? There can be lots of issues you disagree with him about. But why try to destroy him?""Because of the seriousness of the charge, the utter absence of evidence and the clear intention to harm McCain just days before a critical Republican primary, we find this claim to be Pants on Fire wrong."
